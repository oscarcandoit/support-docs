### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/meta-box/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion can detect user fields created with [Meta Box](https://metabox.io/) and the [MB User Meta extension](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-user-meta/), and sync field data to your CRM of choice when a user profile is updated.

The sync of data is bi-directional, so WP Fusion can also load data from your CRM into fields created with Meta Box.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/meta-box/\#setup) Setup

Head to Settings » WP Fusion » Contact Fields, and scroll down to the **Meta Box** header:

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-box-fields-1024x308.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-box-fields.jpg)

For each user field, you’ll see the field name and field key in your database. In the right column you can select a corresponding field in your CRM from the dropdown.

When the user’s profile is updated, WP Fusion will sync the field value from WordPress to the selected custom field in your CRM.

For more information on syncing contact fields, [see this page](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
