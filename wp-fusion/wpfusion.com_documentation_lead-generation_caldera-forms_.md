### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/caldera-forms/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [Caldera Forms](https://calderaforms.com/) to add contacts to your CRM when they submit a form on your site. You can also tag contacts based on the form that was submitted.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/caldera-forms/\#setup) Setup

After creating your form, go to the form Processors tab, and click Add Processor.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/caldera-forms-1-1024x564.jpg)

From the list select WP Fusion, and a settings panel will display.

At the top you can enter a comma-separated list of any tags you’d like to be applied when the form is submitted.

Beneath this is a list of all the available fields in your CRM. For each field you can associate a field from your form by clicking on the box in the right column.
