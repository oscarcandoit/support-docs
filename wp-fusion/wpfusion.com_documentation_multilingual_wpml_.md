### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/multilingual/wpml/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WPML](https://wpml.org/) to sync a user’s language preference to your CRM.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wpml-1024x138.jpg)

From the Contact Fields tab in the WP Fusion settings, you can enable the `language_code` and `language_name` fields for sync.

When a user registers or updates their language preference, these fields will be updated in your CRM.

The language preference will also be synced when WP Fusion creates or updates a contact record for a guest, for example via a form submission or guest checkout.
