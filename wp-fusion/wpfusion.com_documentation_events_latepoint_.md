### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/latepoint/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [LatePoint](https://latepoint.com/) to sync appointment bookings to [any one of 50+ supported CRMs and marketing automation platforms](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/), and apply tags based on booked services.

You can use this data to create segments in your marketing lists, or to trigger automations to follow up with customers before and after their appointment time.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/latepoint/\#syncing-bookings-and-custom-fields) Syncing bookings and custom fields

WP Fusion makes several LatePoint fields available for sync from [the Contact Fields tab](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) in the WP Fusion settings.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/latepoint-fields-1024x760.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/latepoint-fields.jpg)

The fields include the booking details (like start and end date, duration, and price), the booked service, and agent details.

If you are using the [Custom Fields addon](https://latepoint.com/addon/custom-fields), any custom fields will also be listed.

For each field, select a corresponding custom field in your connected CRM to enable it for sync.

When an appointment is booked any enabled fields will be synced to the customer’s contact record in your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/latepoint/\#tagging-customers) Tagging customers

WP Fusion provides a few tagging options for Latepoint. These can be found at the bottom of the settings list when editing any individual service.

The options are:

- **Apply Tags – Booked:** These tags will be applied in your CRM when someone books the service.
- **Apply Tags – Cancelled:** These tags will be applied when someone cancels their booking to the service.
- **Apply Tags – Completed:** These tags will be applied when a booking to the service is marked completed.
