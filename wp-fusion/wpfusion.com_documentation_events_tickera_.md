### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/tickera/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with the [Tickera event ticketing system](https://tickera.com/) to allow you to sync event attendees to your [CRM of choice](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) when they purchase a ticket.

You can also optionally apply CRM tags based on the ticket that was purchased, and apply tags when an attendee is checked in to an event.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/tickera/\#adding-contacts) Adding contacts

By default WP Fusion will sync any event registrations to your CRM as contact records, with the name and email address provided at registration.

If a contact already exists with the same email address they will be updated.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/tickera/\#syncing-custom-fields) Syncing custom fields

WP Fusion makes a few Tickera custom fields available for sync with your CRM. These can be found on the [Contact Fields tab](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) in the WP Fusion settings.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tickera-fields-1024x364.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tickera-fields.jpg)

When someone purchases a ticket, any enabled fields will be synced to the corresponding custom fields on their contact record in your CRM.

The available fields are:

- **Event Name:** The name of the event the person registered for
- **Event Location:** The name of the event location
- **Event Start Date and Time:** The start date and time of the event
- **Event End Date and Time:** The end date and time of the event
- **Ticket Name:** The name of the ticket that was purchased
- **Event Time:** The start time of the event
- **Ticket Checkin Availability From Date:** The start date and time of the ticket checkin window
- **Ticket Checkin Availability To Date:** The end date and time of the ticket checkin window

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/tickera/\#tagging-contacts) Tagging contacts

WP Fusion adds a meta box to the bottom of any Ticket post type. Here you can specify tags to be applied in your CRM when someone registers for that event.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tickera-ticket-settings-1024x333.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tickera-ticket-settings.jpg)

There are two settings:

- The tags specified for **Apply Tags** will be applied in your CRM when someone purchases the ticket.
- The tags specified for **Apply Tags – Checked In** will be applied to the ticket buyer when they are checked in to the event.
