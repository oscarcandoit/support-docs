### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/page-builders/wpbakery-page-builder/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with the [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpbakery.com/) plugin to let you control visibility of page elements based on a user’s tags or lists in your [CRM or marketing automation platform](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/page-builders/wpbakery-page-builder/\#access-control) Access Control

To set up access rules on WPBakery elements, open the settings for any widget, and click on the WP Fusion tab.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wpbakery-1-1024x590.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wpbakery-1.jpg)

The **Visibility** dropdown sets the default visibility for the widget. The options are:

- **Everyone:** The widget will be visible to everyone regardless of whether they’re logged in or not (this is the default)
- **Logged In Users:** The widget will only be visible to logged in users
- **Logged Out Users:** The widget will only be visible to guests on your site

Depending on the visibility mode you’ve selected, there will be additional options

- **Required Tags (any):** The element will only be shown if the user is logged in and has at least one of the specified tags
- **Required Tags (all):** The element will only be shown if the user is logged in and has _all_ of the specified tags
- **Required Tags (not):** If the Visibility mode is set to _Everyone_, the element will be shown to guests, and hidden from logged in users if they _have_ any of the specified tags. If the visibility mode is set to _Logged In Users_, the element will be hidden from guests, and hidden from logged in users if they _have_ any of the specified tags

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/page-builders/wpbakery-page-builder/\#visibility-indicator) Visibility indicator

When editing content with WP Bakery, widgets that are protected by WP Fusion access rules will be displayed with an orange dotted line.
