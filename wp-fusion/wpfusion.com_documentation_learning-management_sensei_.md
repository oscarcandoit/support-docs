Using WP Fusion and the [Sensei addon for WooCommerce](https://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/), you can restrict access to Lessons, and Topics based on a user’s CRM tags.

You can also apply tags to a user when they’ve begun a lesson, or topic, and likewise when it has been marked complete.

See the screenshot on the right for an example of the options WP Fusion offers you when configuring a Sensei course.
