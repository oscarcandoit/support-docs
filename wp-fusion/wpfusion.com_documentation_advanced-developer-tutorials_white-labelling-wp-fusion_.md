### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/advanced-developer-tutorials/white-labelling-wp-fusion/\#overview) Overview

There may be cases where you want to rename WP Fusion in the WordPress admin, for example on a client website or as part of a [WaaS](https://blog.runcloud.io/wordpress-multisite-waas/).

All of WP Fusion’s strings can be modified using the [`gettext` filter](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/gettext/). The texdomain for WP Fusion is `wp-fusion`.

The textdomain for the addon plugins can be found at the top of each plugin’s main PHP file (for example `wp-fusion-logins` for the [Logins Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/logins/overview/)).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/advanced-developer-tutorials/white-labelling-wp-fusion/\#example) Example

In this example we’ve renamed WP Fusion to “CRM Integration”:

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/white-labelled-wp-fusion-1024x532.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/white-labelled-wp-fusion.jpg)

The code snippet is:

```php
function white_label_wp_fusion( $translation, $text, $domain ) {

	if ( 'wp-fusion' === $domain ) {
		$translation = str_replace( 'WP Fusion', 'CRM Integration', $translation );
	}

	return $translation;
}

add_filter( 'gettext', 'white_label_wp_fusion', 10, 3 );
```

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/advanced-developer-tutorials/white-labelling-wp-fusion/\#white-labelling-the-crm) White labelling the CRM

It’s also possible to rename the connected CRM, in addition to (or instead of) renaming WP Fusion. This can be achieved with the [wp\_fusion\_init\_crm action](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/actions/wp_fusion_init_crm/).
