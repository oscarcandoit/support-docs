### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/studiocart/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [Studiocart](https://wpfusion.com/go/studiocart) to sync your customers with contact records in [any one of 50+ CRMs and marketing automation tools.](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/)

You can also apply tags (or lists) to your customers based on product purchases, as well as events like payment failures and subscription cancellations.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/studiocart/\#setup) Setup

When editing any Studiocart product, in the Product Settings meta box click on the Integrations tab, and then press **Add New** to add a new integration.

From the Service dropdown, select either **WP Fusion – Apply Tags** or **WP Fusion – Remove Tags**.

Next, select your triggers. The available triggers are:

- Product Purchased
- Subscription Active
- Product Refunded
- COD Order Created
- Installment Plan Completed
- Subscription Canceled
- Subscription Paused
- Subscription Renewal Charged
- Subscription Renewal Failed

For each trigger, you can select one or more tags to be applied or removed in your connected CRM.
