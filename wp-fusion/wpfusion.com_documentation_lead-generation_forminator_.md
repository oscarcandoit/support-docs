### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/forminator/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [Forminator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/forminator/) to add contacts to your [CRM or email marketing platform](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) when they submit a form on your site. You can also tag contacts based on the form that was submitted.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/forminator/\#setup) Setup

After creating your form, go to the form settings and click on Integrations, and click the + icon next to WP Fusion to add a new WP Fusion integration.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/forminator-forms-1024x538.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/forminator-forms.jpg)

In the popup that appears, give your integration a name, and then proceed to map your form fields with CRM fields.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/forminator-field-mapping-1024x611.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/forminator-field-mapping.jpg)

Finally, select any tags or lists you’d like to be applied when the form is submitted.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/forminator-additional-options-1024x633.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/forminator-additional-options.jpg)

That’s it! When your form is submitted, a contact will be created or updated in your CRM based on the submitted data, and any selected tags or lists will be applied.
