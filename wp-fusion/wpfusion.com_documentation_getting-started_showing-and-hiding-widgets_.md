- Showing and Hiding Widgets

**Heads up!** Since WordPress 5.8, widgets are now managed using the block editor. To show and hide widgets based on CRM tags, we recommend the [Block Visibility plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility/), which includes [an integration with WP Fusion](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/page-builders/gutenberg/). Or, to use the classic widgets editing experience, install the [Classic Widgets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/showing-and-hiding-widgets/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion also has the ability to control widget visibility based on a logged-in user’s tags.

By checking the box next to **Users must be logged in to see this widget**, the widget only be visible to logged in users.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/widget-settings-1-663x1024.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/widget-settings-1.jpg)

There are two tag select boxes. The first lets you specify a list of tags _required_ to view the widget. The widget will be hidden from users who don’t have these tags.

The second box lets you hide the widget _from_ people who have certain tags. This might be useful in removing a promotion after the customer has already purchased the product, for example.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/showing-and-hiding-widgets/\#additional-widget-options) Additional Widget Options

For additional widget visibility options, like logged in vs. logged out, or mobile vs. desktop, check out the free [If Widget plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/if-widget/).
