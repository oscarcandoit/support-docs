### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/advanced-developer-tutorials/applying-removing-tags-with-javascript/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion has a basic JavaScript API that lets you apply and remove tags from the current logged in user.

The AJAX methods are `apply_tags` and `remove_tags`, and they accept a comma-separated list of tags.

Note, to make use of the `wpf_ajax.ajaxurl` variable, **Link Click Tracking** should be turned on in the WP Fusion settings, on the Advanced tab. You can also use your own `ajaxurl` variable.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/advanced-developer-tutorials/applying-removing-tags-with-javascript/\#apply-tags-with-javascript) Apply tags with JavaScript

```javascript
var data = {
	'action' : 'apply_tags',
	'tags'   : 'Tag One, Tag Two'
};

$.post(wpf_ajax.ajaxurl, data);
```

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/advanced-developer-tutorials/applying-removing-tags-with-javascript/\#remove-tags-with-javascript) Remove tags with JavaScript

```javascript
var data = {
	'action' : 'remove_tags',
	'tags'   : 'Tag One, Tag Two'
};

$.post(wpf_ajax.ajaxurl, data);
```
