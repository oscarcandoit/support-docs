### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/yith-woocommerce-booking/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [YITH WooCommerce Booking](https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-booking/) that allows you to sync a customer’s booking date to a custom field in your CRM.

You can then use this to send emails and other automated engagements before and after a customer’s booking date.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/yith-woocommerce-booking/\#setup) Setup

Setup is straightforward, when YITH WooCommerce Booking is active, the fields **Booking Start Date** and **Booking End Date** will appear for sync on the [Contact Fields](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) tab in the WP Fusion settings.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yith-woo-booking-1024x523.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/yith-woo-booking.jpg)

When either field is enabled for sync, the customer’s booking date (and time) will be synced to the selected custom field in your CRM after checkout.

For applying tags based on the purchased product and other settings, see the [WooCommerce integration documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce/).
