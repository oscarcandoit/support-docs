### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/automatorwp/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [AutomatorWP](https://wpfusion.com/go/automatorwp) to allow you to automate actions in hundreds of plugins and third-party services based on tag changes in [your connected CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

For more information on the similarities and differences between WP Fusion and AutomatorWP, check out [WP Fusion vs AutomatorWP](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/how-are-we-different/#wp-fusion-vs-uncanny-automator).

**Note:** To use WP Fusion with AutomatorWP, you must install the [AutomatorWP – WP Fusion addon](https://automatorwp.com/add-ons/wp-fusion/?ref=3).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/automatorwp/\#setup) Setup

Create a new recipe and choose WP Fusion as the trigger. The available options are **Tag Applied** and **Tag Removed**. For each you can select a single tag from the dropdown.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/automatorwp-tag-trigger-automation-1024x561.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/automatorwp-tag-trigger-automation.jpg) In this automation, when the Entry Approved tag is applied, a course is marked complete for the user.

Then, connect your trigger to one or more actions. When the selected tag is applied (or removed), the connected actions will be triggered.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/automatorwp/\#action) Action

WP Fusion can also be used as an action connected to another trigger. The available actions are **Apply tag**, **Remove tag**, and **Track Event**(via the [Event Tracking addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/event-tracking-overview/)).

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/automatorwp-automation-1024x550.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/automatorwp-automation.jpg) In this example, a tag is applied the first time the user logs in to the site.
