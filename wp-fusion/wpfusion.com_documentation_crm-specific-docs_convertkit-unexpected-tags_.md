- Unexpected Tags with ConvertKit

Due to some quirks with ConvertKit, you cannot create a new subscriber via the API without also applying a tag. It’s recommended to set a general tag in the Assign Tags setting to be applied to all new subscribers.

If you don’t specify a tag here, the first available tag in the list will be applied.
