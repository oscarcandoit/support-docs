### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/memberoni/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with the [Memberoni theme](https://memberoni.membershipacademy.com/) by The Member Site Academy, allowing you to apply tags in your CRM as students progress through courses and lessons.

WP Fusion adds a meta box to each course, lesson, roadmap, and roadmap step where you can specify tags that should be applied when the unit is marked complete.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/memberoni-1024x257.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/memberoni.jpg)

When the course or lesson is marked complete the selected tags will be applied to the student in your CRM.

If a lesson or roadmap step is later marked incomplete by the user, the tags will be automatically removed.
