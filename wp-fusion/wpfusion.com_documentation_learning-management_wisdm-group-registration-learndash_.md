### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/wisdm-group-registration-learndash/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [WISDM Group Registration for LearnDash](https://wisdmlabs.com/group-registration-for-learndash/) to give you additional options for tagging your students [in your CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) based on group enrollments.

When editing any product in WooCommerce you’ll see an additional option for _Apply tags when a user is added to this LearnDash group_.

Any tags specified here will be copied to the new LearnDash group created at checkout into the [Apply Tags – Enrolled setting](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/learndash/#groups). Then, as users are enrolled into the group, the selected tags will be applied in your CRM.
