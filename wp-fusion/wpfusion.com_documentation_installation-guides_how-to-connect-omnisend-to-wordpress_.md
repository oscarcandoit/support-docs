In this guide, you will learn how to install WP Fusion and set up a direct connection to integrate your WordPress website with your Omnisend account.

To get started install and activate the WP Fusion plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion.

From the ‘Select Your CRM’ list choose ‘Omnisend’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-configuration-1024x622.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-configuration.png)

Enter your API key, which can be found in your Omnisend account [here](https://app.omnisend.com/integrations/api-keys), and click ‘Connect’ to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with Omnisend in real time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with Omnisend , see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using Omnisend tags to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-omnisend-to-wordpress/\#connect-your-store-to-omnisend) Connect your store to Omnisend

To use automations, first you need to enable [Site tracking](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/) in WP Fusion.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-wpf-site-tracking.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-wpf-site-tracking.png)

Go to your Omnisend account, navigate to Automation, and click ‘Connect your store’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-connect-store.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-connect-store.png)

Select ‘Other’, enter your store URL, and click ‘Connect Store’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-connect-store-verify-1024x638.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-connect-store-verify.png)

Then click ‘Verify and Connect’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-connect-store-verify-and-connect.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-connect-store-verify-and-connect.png)

This will check if the tracking snippet is installed and then the store is connected.

**Note:** In some cases it can take up to 24 hours to validate the tracking script and enable automations in Omnisend. If Omnisend was unable to automatically verify your store, you will see a banner across the top of your account.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1024x117.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image.png) If your store does not appear validated after 24 hours, please [contact Omnisend support](https://www.omnisend.com/contact-us/support/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-omnisend-to-wordpress/\#omnisend-tags) Omnisend tags

At the moment it’s not possible to remove tags via the Omnisend API.

To get around this, when a tag is removed WP Fusion will update a custom property on the subscriber with the tag name, and the value set to `false`.

When loading tags, WP Fusion will also check the subscriber’s custom property values to generate an accurate list of the subscriber’s tags.

This makes Omnisend fully functional with all of WP Fusion’s features and integrations. If you would prefer not to see this custom properties in your account, you can also [create an automation](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/3954813-automation-setup) to remove the associated tag when the custom property is updated.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-omnisend-to-wordpress/\#event-tracking) Event Tracking

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-events-overview-1024x789.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-events-overview.jpg) Custom events tracked by WP Fusion show up in each subscriber’s [activity feed](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/2760491-contact-profile).[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-event-details-1024x576.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/omnisend-event-details.jpg) Clicking Event Details shows the details for a specific event. These values can then be used in automations.

WP Fusion’s [Event Tracking Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/event-tracking-overview/) can send events in real time from supported plugins to Omnisend. For more information, [see the documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/omnisend-event-tracking/).
