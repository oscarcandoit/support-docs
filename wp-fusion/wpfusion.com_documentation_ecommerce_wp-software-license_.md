### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/wp-software-license/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WP Software License for WooCommerce](https://wpsoftwarelicense.com/) to allow you to sync automatically generated license keys to custom fields in your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/wp-software-license/\#setup) Setup

Head to the [Contact Fields list](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) in the WP Fusion settings and scroll down to the [WooCommerce section](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce/#syncing-customer-data-and-custom-fields).

Enable the **License Key** field for sync by selecting a corresponding custom field in your CRM.

When customers check out, or new license keys are generated, they will automatically be synced to the selected custom field on the customer’s contact record.

You can also export license keys for historical orders by running a [WooCommerce Orders batch operation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce/#syncing-historical-orders).
