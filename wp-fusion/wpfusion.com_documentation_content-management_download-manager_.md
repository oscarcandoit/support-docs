# Download Manager

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/download-manager/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [Download Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-manager/) to allow you to protect downloadable files using tags or lists in [your connected CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/download-manager/\#download-setup) Download setup

When editing any Download in the admin, you’ll see the WP Fusion [access control meta box](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) in the sidebar.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-manager-settings-1024x407.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-manager-settings.jpg)

By checking **Users must be logged in to download this file**, you can select tags in your CRM that are required to download the file.

If the user is not logged in or does not have the correct tags, they will be redirected to the page you select in the **Redirect if access is denied** dropdown.

If you do not select a redirect, they will be shown [the default restricted content message](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/#restricted-content-message).
