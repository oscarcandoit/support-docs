### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/parent-student-access-for-learndash/\#overview) Overview

Using WP Fusion with [Parent & Student Access For LearnDash](https://honorswp.com/plugins/parent-and-student-access-for-learndash/) by HonorsWP, you can automatically link student contact records to parent contact records in your [CRM or email marketing system](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/parent-student-access-for-learndash/\#setup) Setup

Head to the WP Fusion Contact Fields settings, scroll down to the LearnDash section and enable the Parent Email field for sync by selecting a corresponding custom field in your CRM.

When a new student account is registered (or an existing account is linked to a parent), the email address of the parent will be synced to the student’s contact record in your CRM.
