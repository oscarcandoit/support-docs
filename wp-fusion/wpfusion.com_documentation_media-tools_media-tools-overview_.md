### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/media-tools-overview/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion’s Media Tools addon allows you to track engagement with embedded videos and audio on your site by applying tags [in your CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) based on different types of user interaction— like video started, completed, and timecode(s) reached.

By using tag triggers in combination with WP Fusion’s content restriction features you can restrict access to pages on your site until users have completed watching a video or a percentage of a video.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/media-tools-alt-player-1024x689.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/media-tools-alt-player.jpg) WP Fusion’s Media Tools addon lets you apply tags in your CRM based on engagement with videos on your site.

The Media Tools addon supports videos embedded with the following players:

- The _Video_, _YouTube_ and _Vimeo_ blocks [in the block editor](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/usage-guide/)
- [Bunny Stream](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/bunny-stream-integration/)
- [Elementor](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/elementor-integration/)
- [FV Player](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/fv-player-integration/)
- [Presto Player](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/presto-player-integration/)

Using this addon with a learning management system such as [LifterLMS](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/lifterlms/) or [LearnDash](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/learndash/) adds a new level of control to your LMS, letting you unlock courses or lessons only after students have completed watching a video or listening to an audio file.
