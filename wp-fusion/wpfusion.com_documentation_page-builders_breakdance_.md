### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/page-builders/breakdance/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion lets you control the visibility of [Breakdance builder](https://breakdance.com/) elements based on a user’s tags or lists in your [connected CRM or marketing automation platform](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

When editing any element, click on the gear icon to access the settings panel.

Click on Edit Conditions to edit the conditions.

From the conditions dropdown, select the _Required CRM Tags_ option, and then select either _has tag_ or _does not have tag **.**_

The logic works like:

- **has tag:** The element will be displayed if the user is logged in and has at least one of the selected tags.
- **does not have tag:** The element will be displayed if the user is logged out, or if they are logged in and have _none_ of the selected tags
