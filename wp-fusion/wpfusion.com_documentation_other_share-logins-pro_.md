### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other/share-logins-pro/\#overview) Overview

[Share Logins](https://codexpert.io/share-logins/) by Codexpert allows you to sync WordPress users and profile updates directly between multiple connected sites, so users can use the same login information across all connected sites.

When WP Fusion detects Share Logins Pro is active, it will automatically register two custom meta keys for sync to other connected sites.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/share-logins-pro-1024x618.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/share-logins-pro-scaled.jpg)

This ensures that a user’s cached contact ID and tags are synced automatically.

WP Fusion will also watch for whenever a user’s tags are modified and sync these changes automatically to any other sites you have connected with Share Logins Pro.
