### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/elementor-integration/\#overview) Overview

The Media Tools addon also has an integration with Elementor to allow configuring the settings inside the Video widget.

These settings appear in the _WP Fusion Media Tools_ panel, and are the same as the options when using the Classic Editor.

- **Apply tags when media started:** These tags will be applied to the user as soon as they click the “Play” button.
- **Apply tags when media completed:** These tags will be applied to the user once the media file completes playing.
- **Timecodes:** Here you can specify multiple timecodes, and for each set tags to be applied when the video progress has passed the timecode.
