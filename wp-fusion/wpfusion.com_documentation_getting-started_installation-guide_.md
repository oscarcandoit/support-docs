### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/installation-guide/\#general-info) General Info

Navigate to Plugins » Add New in your WordPress dashboard and upload the .zip file you received when you purchased WP Fusion.

After you’ve uploaded WP Fusion and activated the plugin, go to Settings » WP Fusion to activate your WP Fusion license key, select your desired CRM, and follow the instructions to configure the initial connection.

[![screenshot](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/general-settings-setup-1024x652.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/general-settings-setup.jpg)

Once you click **Connect**, WP Fusion will validate your API credentials and then load some data from your CRM like your available tags and custom fields.

**Remember:** make sure to activate your license key. A valid license key is required to receive automatic updates, and ensures that your copy of WP Fusion will always be compatible with the latest versions of WordPress and your CRM’s API.

Once that’s finished you can save the settings, and the rest of the WP Fusion options will appear. Proceed to [General Settings and Basic Setup](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/general-settings/) for more info.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/installation-guide/\#resynchronize-available-tags-and-fields) Resynchronize Available Tags and Fields

If you later add new tags or fields in your CRM, you can always go back to the Setup tab and click the blue **Refresh Available Tags & Fields** button to load the latest tags and fields into the dropdowns in WordPress.

This will also update the values for any other dropdowns in WP Fusion’s settings, depending on your connected CRM. For example available products, pipelines, deal stages, owners, and contact layouts.

All data that’s not tied to a specific contact record can be refreshed by clicking **Refresh Available Tags and Fields**.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/installation-guide/\#initial-user-sync) Initial User Sync

After you’ve connected WP Fusion to your CRM and saved the settings page, WP Fusion will go through the users on your site and attempt to match them with contact records in your CRM.

A status bar will appear at the top of the page showing this progress. If a match is found the contact’s ID and tags will be loaded and cached in WordPress for future use.

No data will be sent to your CRM during this process and no user data will be modified.
