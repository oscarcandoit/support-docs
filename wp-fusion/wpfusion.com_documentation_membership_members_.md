### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/members/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with the free [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) plugin to allow you to apply tags in [your connected CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) based on changes to user roles, as well as automatically assign user roles based on activity in your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/members/\#role-settings) Role Settings

When editing any Members user role, a WP Fusion metabox will appear in the sidebar.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/members-edit-role-1024x648.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/members-edit-role.jpg)

Here you can select a tag that becomes “linked” with the role:

- When a user is added to the role, the linked tag will be applied
- When a user is removed from the role, the linked tag will be removed
- When the tag is applied to a user, **they will be granted the role**
- When the tag is removed from the user (or if the user doesn’t have the tag), the role will be removed

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/members/\#how-it-looks) How it looks

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/members-auto-enrollment-1024x750.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/members-auto-enrollment.jpg) In this screenshot a user has been imported via an [Ontraport webhook](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/ontraport-webhooks/) and automatically assigned the role Custom Members Role based on the tag “paid membership purchased”
