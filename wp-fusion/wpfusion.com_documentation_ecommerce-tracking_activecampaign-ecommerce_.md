### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion’s Ecommerce Addon (available for Plus and Professional license holders) allows you to track customer purchases and lifetime revenue in ActiveCampaign for sales made in:

- [WooCommerce](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/easy-digital-downloads/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [Event Espresso](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/event-espresso/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [GiveWP](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/give/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [SureCart](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/surecart/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [Gravity Forms](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravity-forms/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [LifterLMS](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/lifterlms/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- [MemberPress](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/integrations/memberpress/#enhanced-ecommerce)
- and [Restrict Content Pro](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/restrict-content-pro/#enhanced-ecommerce)

After installing the plugin, go to the WP Fusion settings page and click on the _Enhanced Ecommerce_ tab to see the configurable options.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#deep-data) Deep Data

**Note:** Deep Data integration with ActiveCampaign requires a Plus level plan or higher.

**Warning:** If you’re connecting WooCommerce to ActiveCampaign via WP Fusion’s Deep Data integration, make sure you’ve deactivated and disconnected ActiveCampaign’s [native WooCommerce integration](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000652490-WooCommerce-Deep-Data-integration-overview), as having two active connections will result in duplicate order data.

WP Fusion includes support for ActiveCampaign’s [Deep Data API](http://www.activecampaign.com/deep-data/). On the _Enhanced Ecommerce_ tab in the WP Fusion settings, check the box next to Deep Data and save the settings to initialize the connection.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-3-1-1024x894.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-3-1.jpg)

In your ActiveCampaign account, navigate to the settings and click on the Integrations tab. You should see WP Fusion listed.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-connected-integrations-1024x561.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-connected-integrations.jpg)

Any sales made in any of the supported plugins will be added to the corresponding contact record using the new deep data display. ActiveCampaign will automatically track lifetime revenue, total orders, and total products purchased for the contact.

**Note:** When WP Fusion is connected to ActiveCampaign via Deep Data, ActiveCampaign will apply a tag “WP Fusion-customer” to anyone who makes a purchase. This is an ActiveCampaign feature and can’t be turned off, though the tag can be removed using an automation.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#how-it-looks) How it looks

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-5-1024x875.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-5.jpg) Deep Data from WooCommerce showing on the contact record in ActiveCampaign[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-6.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-6.jpg) The order details are shown inside ActiveCampaign[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-with-attributes-773x1024.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-with-attributes.jpg) Deep Data order showing selected product attributes, with the **Sync Attributes** setting on.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#refunds) Refunds

ActiveCampaign doesn’t have a specific order state for “refunded”. However, when Deep Data is enabled, if an order is refunded or cancelled in WooCommerce the order total in ActiveCampaign will be updated to $0.00 so that lifetime values are still calculated accurately.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#coupons) Coupons

ActiveCampaign’s email editor has a [coupon block](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/10765932583196-Use-the-Coupon-block-with-your-email-campaigns) that can be used to insert a WooCommerce coupon into an email campaign.

At the moment the coupon block is **not supported** **with WP Fusion**. Since the coupon is not unique per contact (i.e. everyone who receives the campaign receives the same coupon), we’ve found it’s just as easy to [create the coupon in WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/posts/coupons-with-woocommerce/) and copy the code into the campaign email.

However, if you would prefer to have access to the coupon block, you can disable the Enhanced Ecommerce addon for WP Fusion, and instead use [ActiveCampaign’s WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activecampaign-for-woocommerce/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#revenue-tracking) Revenue Tracking

**Note:** If you’re using our Deep Data integration with ActiveCampaign, revenue tracking is handled automatically by ActiveCampaign. You only need to set up revenue tracking if you’ve elected _not_ to use the Deep Data API.

To set up revenue tracking, first create a new contact custom field in ActiveCampaign. This field will be used to track the total amount spent by a customer in your store. If the field doesn’t appear in the Total Revenue Field dropdown, begin typing the name and click “Resynchronize” at the prompt to load the new custom field from ActiveCampaign.

Whenever a customer checks out on your store, this field will be incremented with the total value of their purchase.

![ac-setup](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-setup-1024x308.jpg)

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#deals-tracking) Deals Tracking

For more advanced ecommerce automation, [ActiveCampaign’s Deals system](http://www.activecampaign.com/crm/) is one of the best systems available. Using the Enhanced Ecommerce Addon, WP Fusion can create deals in ActiveCampaign with the order value and other details, and associate those deals with the originating customer.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/deals-tracking-01-1024x445.jpg)

**Note:** The Deal settings will be hidden if your ActiveCampaign account doesn’t support Deals, or if you haven’t created any Pipelines or Stages yet. If you’ve just created a new Pipeline, click Resynchronize on the Setup tab to reload the available Pipelines and Stages. The settings should now be visible.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#how-to-enable-deals) How to Enable Deals

To enable deals tracking, first check the box next to Deals in the Ecommerce Tracking settings. Next select a pipeline and stage where new deals will be inserted (deals can later be moved using automations).

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deals-admin-1024x645.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deals-admin.jpg)

If you’ve just created a pipeline or stage and it doesn’t appear in the list, go to the Setup tab and the Refresh Available Tags & Fields button to reset the list of available pipelines and stages.

Once enabled, deals will be added to ActiveCampaign like in the screenshot below.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deals-1-1024x674.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deals-1.jpg)

Each deal will have a title indicating the plugin that created the deal and order number. The deal value will be set to the total value of the purchase, and the deal will be assigned to the contact record who made the order.

A note will be attached to the deal containing the products purchased and a link to view the associated order in your WordPress admin.

Using [ActiveCampaign’s Automations](http://www.activecampaign.com/automation/) you can then move deals between stages, create followup tasks, set deal statuses, and much more.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#custom-deal-fields) Custom deal fields

WP Fusion does not have the ability to directly map custom order fields with custom deal fields (for example options collected by [WooCommerce Product Options](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce-product-options/)).

However, you can use an automation to copy the values from the contact record to custom deal fields.

Since WP Fusion creates the contact at checkout before the deal, we will use _Contact’s deal stage changes_ as the start trigger for the automation, to ensure the contact is fully saved.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-ecom-deal-custom-fields-3-1024x581.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-ecom-deal-custom-fields-3.jpg)

Next, set any entry criteria, for example you can limit the trigger to only a specific stage, or to only contact’s with a specific tag.

Connect the trigger to an _Update a custom deal field_ action.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-ecom-deal-custom-fields-1-1024x458.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-ecom-deal-custom-fields-1.jpg)

And in the settings, select your custom deal field, and choose _Copy data from an existing Contact_ as the action. For the Value, select the custom field on the contact to copy the value from.

You can add multiple fields by clicking the _Add a field_ link.

Finally, for _Affects_, select _Triggered Deal_, to ensure that only the deal that was just created is updated.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-ecom-deal-custom-fields-2-1024x639.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-ecom-deal-custom-fields-2.jpg)

In the example above, we have an automation that is triggered whenever a deal is created in the Order Placed deal stage, by contacts who have the tag _Event Attendee_.

The action copies the value of Event Name from the contact to the Registered Event Name on the deal. This lets us see the name of the ticket the contact registered for (for example with [The Events Calendar / Event Tickets](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/the-events-calendar-event-tickets/)).

The Enhanced Ecommerce addon has three filters specific to ActiveCampaign, `wpf_ecommerce_activecampaign_add_deal`, `wpf_ecommerce_activecampaign_add_deal_note` and `wpf_ecommerce_activecampaign_add_deep_data` depending on whether you’re syncing Deals or Deep Data.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#deal-filter) Deal Filter

For example to modify the deal title:

```php
function my_custom_deal_properties( $deal, $order_id ) {

	/* $deal is structured like (see https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference#create-a-deal-new)

	$deal = array(
		'title'     => 'WooCommerce Order #XXX',
		'value'     => 100,
		'currency'  => 'usd',
		'pipeline'  => '1',
		'stage'     => '1',
		'contactid' => '123',
		'owner'     => '1',
	); */

	$deal['title'] = 'My Order #' . $order_id; // Change the title

	return $deal;

}

add_filter( 'wpf_ecommerce_activecampaign_add_deal', 'my_custom_deal_properties', 10, 2 );
```

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#deal-note-filter) Deal Note Filter

For example to modify the note description:

```php
function my_custom_note( $note, $order_id ) {

	$note = 'My custom note for order #' . $order_id;

	return $note;

}

add_filter( 'wpf_ecommerce_activecampaign_add_deal_note', 'my_custom_note', 10, 2 );
```

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/\#deep-data-filter) Deep Data Filter

For example to record the use of a WooCommerce coupon:

```php
function my_custom_deep_data_properties( $data, $order_id ) {

	/* $data is structured like below (for more info https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference#create-order)

	$data = array(
		'ecomOrder' => array(
			'externalid'    => '123',
			'source'        => '1',
			'email'         => 'email@example.com',
			'orderNumber'   => '123',
			'orderProducts' => array(
				'externalid'  => 'PROD12345',
				'name'        => 'Pogo Stick',
				'price'       => 4900,
				'quantity'    => 1,
				'category'    => 'Toys',
				'sku'         => 'POGO-12',
				'description' => 'lorem ipsum...',
				'imageUrl'    => 'https://example.com/product.jpg',
				'productUrl'  => 'https://store.example.com/product12345'
			),
			'orderUrl'      => 'https://store.example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_id=123',
			'orderDate'     => '2016-09-13T17:41:39-04:00',
			'totalPrice'    => 4900,
			'currency'      => 'USD',
			'connectionid'  => '1',
			'customerid'    => '123',
		),
	); */

	$order = wc_get_order( $order_id );

	$coupons = $order->get_coupon_codes(); // See if a coupon was used

	if ( ! empty( $coupons ) ) {

		// Add it to the deep data

		$data['orderDiscounts'] = array(
			array(
				'name'           => $coupons[0],
				'type'           => 'order',
				'discountAmount' => $order->get_total_discount(),
			),
		);
	}

	return $data;

}

add_filter( 'wpf_ecommerce_activecampaign_add_deep_data', 'my_custom_deep_data_properties', 10, 2 );
```
