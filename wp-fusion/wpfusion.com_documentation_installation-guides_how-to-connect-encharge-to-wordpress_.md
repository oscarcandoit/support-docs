In this guide, you will learn how to install WP Fusion and set up a direct connection to integrate your WordPress website with your [Encharge](https://wpfusion.com/go/encharge/) account.

To get started install and activate the WP Fusion plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion.

From the ‘Select Your CRM’ list choose ‘Encharge’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/encharge-setup-1-1024x631.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/encharge-setup-1.jpg)

Enter your API key, which can be found in your Encharge account [here](https://app.encharge.io/account/info), and click Connect to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with Encharge in real time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with Encharge, see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using Encharge tags to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-encharge-to-wordpress/\#webhooks) Webhooks

Using webhooks in Encharge flows, you can automatically sync tag changes and contact updates from Encharge back to WordPress. You can even import new users based on Encharge contacts.

[![Configuring webhooks in Encharge](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/encharge-webhooks-1-1-1024x533.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/encharge-webhooks-1-1-scaled.jpg)

For more information, see the documentation on [Encharge Webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/encharge-webhooks/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-encharge-to-wordpress/\#site-tracking) Site tracking

WP Fusion includes a copy of the [Encharge tracking scripts](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/#encharge), which can be enabled on the General settings tab.

[![WP Fusion's Encharge site tracking features](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/encharge-site-tracking-key-2-1024x232.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/encharge-site-tracking-key-2.jpg)

When site tracking is enabled, any new users, customers, or form submissions will automatically be identified to Encharge, and their page views will be tracked.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-encharge-to-wordpress/\#event-tracking) Event tracking

[![A subscriber record in Encharge showing events added by WP Fusion](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/encharge-events-timeline-1024x648.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/encharge-events-timeline.jpg) Events from WordPress appear on the subscriber’s activity timeline in real time. In this example, [LearnDash course progress](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/learndash/#event-tracking) is shown.

WP Fusion’s [Event Tracking Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/event-tracking-overview/) can send events in real time from supported plugins to Encharge. For more information, [see the documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/encharge-event-tracking/).
