### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/thrive-apprentice/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [Thrive Apprentice](https://wpfusion.com/go/thrive-apprentice) to allow you to sync your students with over [50 CRMs and marketing automation platforms](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/), and apply tags or lists based on product purchases and course progress.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/thrive-apprentice/\#setup) Setup

This integration requires the [Uncanny Automator plugin](https://wpfusion.com/go/automator).

First, create an automation, and then select your desired trigger— in this case, we’ve selected **A user progresses in Apprentice Course**.

[![screenshot of a recipe setup in an online course platform. the recipe, titled apprentice automation, triggers when a user progresses in thrive apprentice. the action adds a tag to the user. recipe details and notes appear on the right.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apprentice_automation-1024x437.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apprentice_automation.png)

From the Actions dropdown, select WP Fusion, and there will be two options:

- **Add a tag to the user:** This action will apply one or more tags (or lists) to the user in your connected CRM.
- **Remove a tag from the user:** This action will remove one or more tags (or lists) from the user in your connected CRM.

For more information on WP Fusion’s Uncanny Automator integration, see the [Uncanny Automator documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/uncanny-automator/).
