### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/jetengine/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion’s integration with [JetEngine](https://crocoblock.com/plugins/jetengine/) brings the power of your [CRM or email marketing system](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) to your content management strategy in WordPress.

WP Fusion’s JetEngine integration works in two ways:

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/jetengine/\#post-type-access-rules) Post type access rules

In addition to [protecting individual posts and pages](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) on your site using tags in your CRM, WP Fusion includes a JetEngine integration module to protect entire post types created via JetEngine.

[![screenshot of a wordpress jetengine integration settings page. it shows options to restrict access to post types based on user tags. post type is member articles with a required tag active member and redirect action log in.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jetengine-post-types-1024x400.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jetengine-post-types.jpg)

First, [create your custom post types with JetEngine](https://crocoblock.com/knowledge-base/jetengine/how-to-create-a-custom-post-type-based-on-jetengine-plugin/).

Then navigate to JetEngine » WP Fusion in the WordPress admin. For each post type you can select one or more CRM tags (or lists) that are required to view posts of that post type.

If the user is not logged in, or does not have one of the specified tags, they will be redirected to the page of your choosing.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/jetengine/\#listing-grid-query-filters) Listing Grid query filters

The JetEngine [Listing Grid](https://crocoblock.com/knowledge-base/features/listing-grid-widget-overview/) is a powerful Elementor widget that lets you list content on your site using complex queries involving post types, taxonomy terms, and custom field values.

WP Fusion extends this functionality by personalizing listing grid items based on [access rules](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) configured on each post, and the current user’s tags in your CRM.

[![screenshot of a dashboard showing the wp fusion plugin interface. on the left, options for setting custom query parameters with posts query and filter queries. on the right, a small structure section labeled listing grid.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jetengine-filter-queries-1024x663.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jetengine-filter-queries.jpg)

To enable this feature, click the toggle for _Filter Queries_ under the Posts Query tab when editing the Listing Grid element.

Any content that the user does not have access to will automatically be hidden from the listing grid. This can be used to create personalized listings for each member on your site— for example courses, training resources, or videos.

For more information on Filter Queries, [see the documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/#filter-queries).
