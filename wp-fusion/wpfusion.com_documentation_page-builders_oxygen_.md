### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/page-builders/oxygen/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion lets you control the visibility of [Oxygen](https://oxygenbuilder.com/) components based on a user’s CRM tags. When editing a component, open the Conditions menu, and click Set Conditions to open the conditions modal.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oxygen-1-1024x591.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oxygen-1-scaled.jpg)

Under the User section, select CRM Tags.

For each condition you can either select _Has tag_ or _Does not have tag_. You can combine multiple conditions by clicking the Add Condition button.

If _Does not have tag_ is selected, the component will be shown to logged-out users. You can limit visibility to only logged-in users by adding an additional _User Logged In_ condition.
