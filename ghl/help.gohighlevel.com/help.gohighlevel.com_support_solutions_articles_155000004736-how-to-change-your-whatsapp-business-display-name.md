# **How to Change Your WhatsApp Business Display Name**

**Note :** This guide is for businesses using the **WhatsApp Business Platform**. If you're unsure about the differences between the **WhatsApp Business Platform** and the **WhatsApp Business App**, make sure to review them first.

Your **WhatsApp Business display name** is how your business name appears when messaging customers. Once approved, you have the option to change it. The process varies based on whether your account is an **Official Business Account (OBA)** or a **regular business account**:

- **For regular business accounts**: Follow the steps below to update your display name.
- **For Official Business Accounts (OBA)**: Contact **Direct Support** for assistance.

### Before You Begin

To change your display name, ensure you have the following:

✔️ A **business portfolio** created.

✔️ **Signed up** for the WhatsApp Business Platform by:

- Creating a **WhatsApp Business account** through a Business Solution Provider (BSP).
- Setting up a **WhatsApp Business account** as a BSP.

✔️ A **connected phone number** linked to your WhatsApp Business account.

✔️ Your business **qualifies for a display name** review. [Learn more about eligibility](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004736-how-to-change-your-whatsapp-business-display-name#).

### Steps to Change Your Display Name in Meta WhatsApp Manager

1. **Go to** [Meta Business Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004736-how-to-change-your-whatsapp-business-display-name#) and select your business.
2. **Click** on **WhatsApp Manager**.
3. **Select** the account where you want to update the display name.
4. In the left-hand menu, **click** **Phone Numbers**.
5. Under the **Name** column, **hover over your current display name** and click the **pencil icon**.
6. In the **Edit Display Name** section, enter your new display name.
7. **Click Next** to submit the change for approval.

Once your new display name is approved, you must update it using the appropriate registration method:

- **For WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud API)**: Register the number using the **Registration endpoint** (no certificate needed).
- **For WhatsApp Business Platform (On-Premises API)**: Register the new display name using the **Account endpoint**.

### What Happens After Submission?

- **If your business is NOT verified**: Your display name will be **immediately confirmed**, and the certificate will be available for download.
- **If your business IS verified**: Your display name will show a **"Pending Review"** label under **Certificate** in the **Phone Numbers** section. Once approved, a **"View"** button will appear, allowing you to download the certificate.

### Important Notes:

**1**. **Businesses can change their display name up to 10 times within 30 days**. After 30 days, a new cycle begins with the same limit.

**2.** **The new display name certificate is only valid for 14 days**. If it expires, you'll need to resubmit the display name for approval.

**3\. A display name review is no longer required to get started** on the WhatsApp Business Platform.
