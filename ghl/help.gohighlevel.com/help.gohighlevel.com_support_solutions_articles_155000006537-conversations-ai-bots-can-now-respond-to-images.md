## **What is Conversations AI Image Response?**

Conversations AI Image Response enables HighLevel bots to interpret images customers share—such as product photos, screenshots, receipts, or documents—and respond with context-aware messages. By understanding what’s visible in the picture, the bot reduces back-and-forth and improves resolution speed across supported channels.

Conversations AI Image Response adds real-time image understanding to HighLevel’s Conversations AI bots. When contacts send a supported image, the bot analyzes the picture and uses the visual context to craft a helpful reply that aligns with the ongoing conversation.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Conversations AI Image Response**

The benefits below focus on tangible outcomes you can expect after enabling image responses—quicker resolutions, clearer conversations, and consistent experiences across channels.

- **Visual problem-solving:** Analyze screenshots, receipts, menus, and product photos to provide precise, relevant guidance.

- **Stronger outcomes across visual use cases:** Provide more helpful assistance for support tickets, appointment intake/prep, product questions, and document sharing/verification.

- **Faster resolution:** Reduce follow-up questions about “what’s on screen,” shortening handle time and improving customer satisfaction.

- **Omni-channel consistency:** Maintain the same helpful experience on Live Chat, Facebook Messenger, Instagram DMs, WhatsApp, and SMS/MMS (U.S. & Canada).

- **Multi-image context:** Process multiple images sent together and respond coherently in a single message.

- **Operational efficiency:** Deflect routine inquiries and empower teams to focus on escalations and high-value tasks.


* * *

## **Supported Image Types**

File format support determines whether uploads can be analyzed reliably. Use commonly supported formats for the smoothest experience across channels.

- JPG (.jpg)

- JPEG (.jpeg)

- PNG (.png)

- HEIC (.heic) – **coming soon**


* * *

## **Channel Compatibility**

Channel support ensures your audience can share images from wherever they already message you. Confirm each connected channel supports receiving images in your region and plan.

- Live Chat (Web Widget)

- Facebook Messenger

- Instagram Direct Messages

- WhatsApp

- SMS/MMS (U.S. & Canada)


```
Note: Delivery and size limits can vary by channel and carrier. For best results, verify channel policies before large or high-resolution images.
```

* * *

## **Multi-Image Support**

Customers often share multiple pictures to explain a situation. Handling several images at once keeps conversations concise and avoids fragmented replies.

When multiple images are sent together, the bot analyzes them as a group and provides a single, coherent response that references relevant visual details, reducing message clutter and improving clarity.

* * *

## **How To Setup Conversations AI Image Response**

Proper setup ensures your bot can analyze images as soon as they arrive and respond within the same conversation thread.

1. From your **Sub-Account**, go to AI Agents → Conversation AI → Agent List, then click the three dots (⋮) next to the bot you want to configure and select Edit to open the bot’s settings.

2. **Enable Image Responses**

Toggle **“Also allow this bot to respond to: Images.”** and Save Your Changes

3. **Test on a Connected Channel**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is there an extra fee to use Image Response?**

No Labs add-on is required. Standard messaging rates and any applicable AI usage/pricing in your account apply. For details, see **HighLevel Pricing** and **Conversations AI** plan documentation.

**Q: What image size is supported?**

Limits vary by channel and carrier. For best results, use JPG/PNG within the channel’s recommended maximum. See **Media Library Specs & Formats** and your channel’s media guidelines.

**Q: Will images sent during workflow-initiated conversations be analyzed?**

If the workflow routes the conversation to a bot with **Images** enabled, incoming supported images will be analyzed and responded to in the same thread.

**Q: Can I enable Image Response on some channels but not others?**

The **Images** setting is configured per bot and applies to the channels that bot handles. To vary behavior by channel, route conversations to different bots or use separate bots per channel.

**Q: Does this handle HEIC from iPhone?**

**HEIC support is coming soon.** Until then, ask users to resend as JPG/PNG or enable device settings that capture photos in a compatible format.

**Q: Why did the bot’s response feel generic for a photo?**

Low image quality, heavy compression, or missing context can reduce accuracy. Ask for a clearer image and a short note (e.g., “problem area on the hinge”).
