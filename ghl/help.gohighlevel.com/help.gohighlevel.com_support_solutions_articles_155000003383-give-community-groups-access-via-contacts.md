## **Overview**

We are excited to introduce the new feature, which allows users to seamlessly view and manage **Community Groups** and **Course Offers** directly from the **Contacts** section in the Client Portal. This integration streamlines the process of organizing contacts, managing offers, and handling password resets, enhancing both user convenience and system functionality.

## **Key Features**

### 1\. Add Offers to Contacts Seamlessly

\- From the Contacts page, users can now easily assign offers such as Courses or Community Groups to any contact. This improvement simplifies managing deals, promotions, or course enrollments without the need to leave the page, saving time and enhancing workflow.

### 2\. Group Management Made Easy

\- Organize your contacts by adding them to relevant Community Groups directly from the Contacts page. This feature allows you to segment audiences for targeted campaigns or manage community groups efficiently, all from one centralized location.

### 3\. Password Management for Users

\- Admins can now manage passwords directly from the Contacts page. They can either:

\- Set a new password for the contact.

\- Send a password reset link to the user, making account recovery and security management faster and easier.

### **Step-by-Step Guide: How It Works**

### 1\. Navigating to Contacts

\- Go to the \*\*Contacts\*\* section within the Client Portal.

\- Select the contact you wish to manage.

### 2\. View Client Portal or Courses

\- Based on the configuration for a particular location:

\- If Courses are enabled, the Courses section will appear, replacing the Client Portal section.

\- If the Client Portal is enabled, the Client Portal section will be displayed, including Community Groups.

### 3\. Assign Offers

\- After selecting a contact, you'll see options to assign offers (either Courses or Community Groups).

\- From the list of available offers, simply select the items you wish to assign and confirm the changes.

### 4\. Group Management

\- Use the Community Groups option to add the selected contact to the appropriate groups.

\- This makes it easy to manage contacts within different community categories for various purposes like targeted campaigns or group-specific notifications.

### 5\. Password Management

\- From the Contacts page, you can choose to:

\- Set a new password: Directly update the password for the contact.

\- Send a reset password link: A reset password link will be emailed to the user, allowing them to securely reset their password.

Notes:

\- If Courses are enabled for a specific location, the Courses section will be displayed on the Contacts page, replacing the Client Portal.

\- If the Client Portal is enabled, the Contacts page will show the Client Portal section, which includes community groups for easier management.

```
Group access given via contacts will bypass and additional questions to join or group payment required i.e.
Members will directly get access to the groups
