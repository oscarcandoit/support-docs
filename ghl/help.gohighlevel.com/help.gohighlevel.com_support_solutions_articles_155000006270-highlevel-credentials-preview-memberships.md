## **What is the Credential Preview Experience?**

Credential Preview is the updated, public-facing certificate page that emphasizes trust and shareability. It presents your certificate in a clean, mobile-friendly layout, surfaces key metadata (issuer, issue date, expiry), and provides one-tap options to share or download—so achievements are easy to promote and verify.

- Modern, responsive preview optimized for desktop and mobile.

- Clear info boxes for issuer, issue date, and expiry.

- Public link for easy viewing (no login required).

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Credential Preview**

Understanding the value helps teams roll out the new experience confidently and explain it to learners, hiring managers, and program stakeholders.

- **Professional presentation:** A modern, high-contrast layout enhances the perceived value of the credential.

- **Faster sharing:** Built-in share actions help recipients promote achievements quickly on major platforms.

- **LinkedIn add-to-profile:** A dedicated button streamlines adding the credential to a LinkedIn profile (no copy/paste required).

- **Structured details:** Issuer and validity information appear in clearly separated boxes to build trust.

- **High-quality downloads:** Certificates download as PNG images that preserve design fidelity.


* * *

## **Sleek, Modern Look**

Visual clarity improves credibility and reduces confusion—especially when sharing with employers or clients who need to verify at a glance.

- Clean, distraction-free layout that highlights the certificate artwork.

- Responsive scaling for small screens and large monitors.

## **Sharing Options**

Making sharing effortless increases visibility for your program and encourages recipients to celebrate their accomplishments.

- Direct share actions to **LinkedIn, Facebook, X (Twitter), and WhatsApp** from the preview.

- **LinkedIn Add to Profile** button places the credential directly on the recipient’s profile—eliminating manual entry.

- Public links allow anyone with the URL to view the certificate page without logging in.

```
IMPORTANT: You can get these share options, when you preview an issued certificate.

## **Downloading the Certificate (PNG)**

PNG downloads maintain pixel-perfect design for screens and quick printing, ensuring what you preview is exactly what you save.

- One-click **Download** provides a **PNG** image that matches the original layout.

- Images are pre-generated at issuance for rapid downloads.

## **Verification & Expiry Behavior**

Clear verification and expiry states help viewers trust the credential while giving admins predictable controls.

- Viewers access a **public certificate page** via the share link; key details help confirm authenticity.

- When a certificate **expires**, its preview becomes **unavailable** to the user; issued-certificate expiry takes precedence over template-level expiry.

- Optional reminder emails can be customized (replacing the old 2- and 7-day defaults).

## **How To Set Up Credential Preview**

Proper setup ensures your templates render cleanly and that issuance and sharing work consistently across desktop and mobile.

### **Step 1**: Create or edit a Certificate/Badge: Memberships →Credentials → Templates →  Create Certificate/Badge.

### **Step 2:** Design & map fields in the builder; preview to confirm names, dates, and IDs appear correctly.

### **Step 3:** Send the Certificate/Badge

After you finish creating or editing the certificate or badge, you can either send a test email to your own inbox or share it directly with the recipient. To share, you must enter the instructor’s name and select a recipient. For the email, you can preview the default template or create your own in Templates, then select your custom template before sending.

```
Please Note: You can Preview, Set Expiry, Edit, Delete and Clone a Certificate/Badge by clicking on the three dots of the template.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can anyone view my certificate if they have the link?**

Yes. Shared certificates are publicly accessible via a unique URL, though they are not searchable or indexed.

**Q. Is the download a PDF or an image?**

PNG image. High-quality PNG preserves the exact layout and typically downloads faster than PDF.

**Q. I don’t see Instagram in the share tray—can I still post there?**

Yes. Use **Copy Link** and paste it into Instagram captions, bio, or story link tools. Direct share buttons include LinkedIn, Facebook, X, and WhatsApp.

**Q. What happens when a certificate expires?**

The preview becomes unavailable to the user. Issued certificate expiry overrides template-level expiry.

**Q. Is “Add to LinkedIn profile” the same as Social Planner’s LinkedIn connection?**

No. **Add to Profile** posts the credential to a personal profile record; **Social Planner** is for scheduling LinkedIn posts.
