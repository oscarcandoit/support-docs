# **What is Google Business Profile Integration?**

Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is a free tool by Google that lets businesses manage how they appear across Google Search and Maps. By integrating GBP with HighLevel, businesses can sync customer messages, reviews, and reputation data into the CRM.

Connecting your GBP ensures all Google customer interactions flow into your CRM. This allows you to respond faster, manage reputation more effectively, and centralize communications alongside other channels like SMS, email, and Facebook.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Google Business Profile Integration**

Integrating GBP into HighLevel goes beyond simply connecting accounts. It enhances how your business communicates with prospects and customers by providing visibility and tools directly in the CRM.

- **Centralized Reviews**: New Google reviews automatically sync into Conversations, allowing you to reply without leaving HighLevel.

- **Messaging Integration**: Communication channels are added and they are linked to CRM for syncing messages ( [Communication and Social channel connection with GBP](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005619) )

- **Reputation Tracking**: Monitor and manage reviews inside the Reputation tab.

- **Increased Visibility**: Keep your business profile active, encouraging customer engagement and better local SEO.

- **Streamlined Workflow**: Manage Google interactions alongside other CRM integrations like Facebook, Instagram, and SMS.

Proper setup ensures a seamless flow of Google reviews and messages into your CRM. The steps below walk you through connecting and verifying your GBP with HighLevel.

### **Open Settings**

### **Connect Google Account**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I connect multiple GBP locations to HighLevel?**

Yes, but you’ll need to repeat the connection steps for each location using the same or different Google accounts with proper access.

**Q: What happens if my connection fails?**

Check that your Google account has the correct permissions (Owner or Manager). If issues persist, disconnect and reconnect GBP from Settings > Integrations.

**Q: Do reviews and messages sync instantly?**

Yes, reviews and messages appear in the Conversations stream in near real-time once connected.

**Q: Can I disconnect my GBP later?**

Yes. Simply go to Settings > Integrations and click **Disconnect** next to your Google Business Profile.

**Q: Do I need a verified GBP before connecting?**

Yes, your business must be verified with Google before integration will work.

**Q: Does connecting GBP enable Google Messaging automatically?**

Google messaging has been depricated in Jul 2024. Users can now connect whatsapp number and text number to GBP pages. These channels if integrated to CRM will sync the messages.
