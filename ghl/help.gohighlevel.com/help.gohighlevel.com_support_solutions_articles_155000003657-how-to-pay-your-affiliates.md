GHL allows you to pay your affiliates using any provider or method of your choice, as long as you mark the payouts as completed. However, GHL offers some faster, more efficient options to streamline the process.

* * *

### **Payout Options Available in GHL:**

1. **Auto Payouts via PayPal (Fastest)**: Automate affiliate payments directly from the GHL dashboard using PayPal Payouts API. No need to log in to PayPal or manually mark payouts as paid.
2. **Bank Payments**: Use banks or other methods to pay affiliates manually, then mark the payouts as paid in GHL.

* * *

### **How Payouts Work:**

There are two key steps to handling affiliate payouts:

1. **Generating Payouts**: This is done automatically according to the campaign commissions you've set.
2. **Paying Affiliates & Marking Payouts as Paid**: You can choose between automated PayPal payouts or manual methods. Here's how each works:

* * *

#### **1\. Auto Payouts Using PayPal (Fastest Option)**

PayPal Payouts API is the quickest and most cost-effective way to pay multiple affiliates at once. After a one-time setup, you can securely pay affiliates without leaving the GHL platform.

1. **Go to the Payouts Page**: Head to the payouts section within GHL.
2. **Approve Payouts**: In the "Pending" tab, approve the payouts you want to process.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033860750/original/uw6AMijpWNsuDCoOJNR7-Mfh1MiIr7g5xg.png?1727775682)

How to Set It Up:
1. Go to Affiliate Manager → Settings
2. Click Affiliate Portal Settings → Configure Payout Methods
3. Select the payout methods you want to enable
4. Save your changes
Affiliates will only see the options you’ve enabled, ensuring a smoother and more streamlined payout process.
```

By following these steps, you can ensure timely and efficient payments for your affiliates, whether you choose the automated PayPal option or manual methods.
