# What is the Quizzes & QR Codes Feature Toggle?

Quizzes and QR Codes are now standalone configurable features within HighLevel's SaaS mode. This means you can control their availability at both the SaaS Plan and Sub-Account levels, giving you the power to tailor client offerings with more precision—whether as included tools or premium upsell options.

# Key Benefits of Independent Feature Toggles

Providing granular control over Quizzes and QR Codes gives agencies more power to align feature sets with pricing tiers, user needs, and go-to-market strategies.

- Flexible SaaS Plan Design – Offer Quizzes or QR Codes as standalone features or bundle them with other tools.

- Sub-Account Level Control – Toggle access per client based on custom agreements or plan tiers.

- Improved User Interface – Dedicated tabs under “Sites” streamline how end-users find and use these features.

- Boosted Upsell Potential – Create targeted upgrade paths with premium marketing tools.

- Simplified Management – Reduce client confusion with clean navigation and controlled access.

# Managing Quizzes & QR Codes at the Sub-Account Level

Beyond global SaaS plans, you can fine-tune access to Quizzes and QR Codes for specific clients.

### Steps:

1. Open a client’s Sub-Account Settings from the Agency view.

2. Go to the Company Tab > Settings > Features section.

3. Use the toggles to allow or restrict access to Quizzes and QR Codes.

4. Your changes apply instantly and override the plan-level settings if needed.

# User Interface Enhancements: Easier Navigation for End-Users

Once enabled, your clients will see separate, clearly labeled tabs for Quizzes and QR Codes under the Sites section of their dashboard. This improves discoverability and makes it easier to manage these tools.

Improved UI Benefits:

- Supports intuitive access across different user roles

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Are Quizzes and QR Codes available on all plans by default?

No. You must manually enable them per SaaS plan or Sub-Account.

Q: Can I use these toggles to upsell?

Absolutely. They're designed to let you gate advanced features and create tiered upgrade paths.

Q: Will disabling a feature remove existing data?

No. Disabling access hides the UI but does not delete any existing content created using those tools.

Q: Can Sub-Account toggles override plan-level settings?

Yes. Sub-Account settings take precedence and allow for client-specific configurations.

# Next Steps

- Review your current SaaS plan configurations and determine how you'd like to position Quizzes and QR Codes.

- Communicate the update to your clients, especially if you're adjusting access as part of new pricing tiers.

- Train your team on managing these new controls both globally and per client.

- Monitor usage trends to identify upsell opportunities based on client engagement.
