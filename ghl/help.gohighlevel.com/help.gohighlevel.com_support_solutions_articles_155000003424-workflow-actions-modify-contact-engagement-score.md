## Example

Scenario: Email Engagement Tracking

**Objective**: A digital marketing agency wants to adjust engagement scores for contacts based on their email interactions to better target future campaigns.

Workflow Steps:

**Trigger**:

- **Email Event** \- The workflow is initiated when a contact opens an email sent by the agency.

**Action**:

- **Modify Engagement Score -** The agency configures the action to increase the engagement score by +10 for each trigger link clicked.


Outcome:

- When a contact opens an email and clicks on the trigger link, their engagement score is automatically increased, reflecting their interest in the agency's content.
- This adjustment allows the agency to segment contacts more effectively, prioritizing those with higher engagement scores for future campaigns, such as exclusive offers or personalized content.
- As a result, the agency improves its targeting strategies, leading to higher conversion rates and better overall customer engagement.
