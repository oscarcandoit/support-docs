# **What is A2P Standard Brand Registration?**

A2P messaging refers to any message sent from an application to a person — for example, automated marketing texts or appointment reminders. To send A2P messages in the U.S., you **must register your brand and campaign(s) with The Campaign Registry (TCR)** through your messaging provider (e.g., Twilio).

A Standard Brand is designed for businesses registered with an EIN. It allows **greater messaging throughput and access to a wider variety of campaign use cases** than Sole Proprietor brands.

```
Note: If your business does not have an EIN and only has one employee per company, you can register for sole prop here: A2P Sole Proprietor Brand Registration for 10DLC

## **Key Benefits of Registering as a Standard Brand**

- Higher message throughput compared to Sole Proprietor Brands.

- Required for LLCs, corporations, and most U.S. businesses.

- Improved trust score potential through EIN verification.

- Enables access to broader campaign use cases.

- Lower chance of carrier filtering or message rejection

* * *

## **What Are the Requirements for Standard Brand Registration?**

Before registering, ensure you have the following:

- Business Legal Name (must exactly match IRS records)

- Business Type: LLC, Corporation, etc.

- Business Industry

- Official Business Website

- Business Address

IMPORTANT: Once you click "Continue" or submit your contact details, you will now have to validate this through an OTP sent to your email address. It validates each email address by sending a unique 6-digit one-time password to ensure the sender’s identity is genuine.

## **Handling the "Maximum 3 Tries Exhausted" Error**

If you see the error " **Maximum 3 tries exhausted"**, please [**fill out this form**](https://link.gohighlevel.com/widget/form/mfl7sSEccNAaQZOCalsA) once you have collected the **CP 575 Form.** It means the registration attempts have failed due to mismatched or invalid business details.

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Obtain your CP 575 EIN Confirmation Letter** (or request a 147c letter from the IRS if the CP 575 is unavailable).

2. **Upload your business registration form** in your support communication with us.

3. **Email or send a screenshot** of your CP 575 form to the HighLevel team.


We will submit this documentation on your behalf for Brand approval.

### **Important Tips:**

- Ensure the **legal business name and EIN number exactly match** what’s shown on the CP 575 form.

- Do **not** use the business name found on W2 or W9 forms, as they may differ.

- If the business name spans multiple lines on your CP 575/147c letter, you must enter **all lines above the address line** during registration.



**Example:**



ABC Holding Group Inc.

Division of Regional Services

123 Main Street

New York, NY 10001



**The legal name to enter would be:** ABC Holding Group Inc. Division of Regional Services


* * *

## **Understanding Trust Scores & Throughput**

Once submitted, your brand will be vetted and assigned a **Trust Score (0–100) by TCR**.

Higher scores allow for **higher Message Throughput (MPS)** and **better delivery rates**. The Trust Score is determined based on your submitted information — EIN match, business type, domain verification, and more.

**Check out our article for more information:** [Trust Scores and MPS Explained](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004527)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the difference between Sole Proprietor and Standard Brand?**

Sole Prop is for individuals without an EIN. Standard Brand is for registered U.S. businesses with an EIN.

**Q: Why was my brand rejected?**

Likely reasons include EIN mismatch, invalid website, or use of a PO Box.

**Q: Can I add new numbers after completing A2P Brand and Campaign Registration?**

Yes. Any numbers you add after your brand and campaign are approved will be automatically registered under the same campaign — no resubmission is needed. It may take several days for registration to complete.

**Q: How much does this cost?**

Fees vary, checkout our article on [Understanding A2P 10DLC Messaging Fees: Registration, Monthly, and Carrier Costs.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005200)

**Q: Can I register multiple campaigns under one Standard Brand?**

Yes, you can register multiple use-case-specific campaigns.

**Q: I don't want to deal with all of this. Is there any alternative for me and my clients?** Yes, you can bypass A2P 10DLC by switching to **Toll-Free Numbers**. These also require registration, but the process is **free and less complex**. You can continue messaging in the U.S. without A2P 10DLC restrictions. See: [Toll-Free Verification Guide for LC - Phone (US/Canada)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222300)

Please reach out to HighLevel support. We’ll share a form that you can submit, and our team will create the brand and campaign manually in the backend for increased throughput.

A2P 10DLC is applicable for all Application-to-Person texting like marketing SMS, reactivation campaigns, appointment reminders, prospecting, billing alerts, 2FA login codes, etc.
