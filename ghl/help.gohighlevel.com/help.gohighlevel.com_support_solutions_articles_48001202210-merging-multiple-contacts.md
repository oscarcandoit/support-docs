# **What is Merging Duplicate Contacts?**

Merging duplicate contacts in HighLevel allows you to **consolidate multiple records for the same individual or business into one unified contact**. This helps reduce confusion, eliminate redundant communications, and ensure a clean contact database.

Duplicates can occur from manual entry, CSV imports, form submissions, or third-party integrations like Zapier. HighLevel identifies duplicates based on matching fields, such as names, emails, or phone numbers.

## **Key Benefits of Merging Duplicate Contacts**

- Ensures CRM data hygiene and prevents duplicate outreach.

- Combines notes, tasks, conversations, and workflows into one record.

- Improves campaign accuracy and reporting.

- Reduces confusion during support and sales follow-ups.

- Optimizes automation and contact routing.

## **Steps to Merge Duplicate Contacts**

1. Navigate to the **Contacts** from your HighLevel sub-account.

2. Use the **Quick** **Search** bar to find duplicate contacts by entering a common identifiers like **name** or **email**.

3. You can also **search manually** from the contact list.

### **Step 3:** Choose the Master Record

Choosing the Master Record ensures its **primary details are preserved during the merge**, while relevant data from the other records is combined into it to create a single, complete contact.

2. Select the **Master Contact**.

3. You can also select the **Primary Email/Phone** for the Master contact from any of the selected contacts.

4. Click on **Merge Contacts** button.

```
Important: When merging, the Master Contact keeps all key data. Info from the Child Contact is permanently lost; review carefully before confirming.

Avoiding duplicate contacts at the source can save significant time and confusion later. Contact Deduplication Settings give you control over how the system handles new contact entries, allowing you to prevent duplicates before they happen.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Business Profile > Contact Preferences**.

2. Enable or disable **Allow Duplicate Contacts**.

3. Choose primary and secondary deduplication fields (Email or Phone).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I merge contacts using the LeadConnector mobile app?**

Currently, the ability to merge contacts is not available in the LeadConnector mobile app. This feature is planned for release in Q3, along with additional bulk actions. In the meantime, you can merge contacts using the desktop version of HighLevel.

**Q. What happens to field data during a merge?**

The selected master record retains its details, while unique fields from other records are added to it.

**Q: Why don’t I see the “Merge Contacts” button?**

The “Merge Contacts” button only appears when you select 2 or more valid contacts (up to a maximum of 10). If the contacts you’re trying to merge are missing key fields (like a name, email, or phone number), the system may not allow a merge. Additionally, ensure that **1.** You have admin permissions to manage contacts. **2.** You’re selecting contacts from the same sub-account. **3.** Both contacts are visible in your contact list view (check filters).

**Q. Can I merge contacts in bulk?**

No, you can merge up to 10 contacts at a time.

**Q: What causes duplicate contacts in HighLevel?**

Duplicates can come from manual entry, CSV import, forms, or third-party tools like Zapier.

**Q: Will the contact's custom values or fields be affected?**

Custom fields from the secondary contact will only be added if the corresponding field is blank in the primary. No overwriting will occur.

**Q: How do I know which contact to choose as the master?**

Choose the record with the most accurate and up-to-date information. The master contact retains conversations, last activity, files, and other data.

**Q: Can HighLevel automatically find all duplicate contacts for me?**

No. While you can manually search by name, phone, or email, HighLevel does not currently offer a full database scan for duplicates.

**Q: How do I prevent duplicates from form or calendar submissions?**

Make sure “Allow Duplicate Contacts” is turned off in your deduplication settings.
