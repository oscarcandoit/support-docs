# **What is the New Prospecting Tool Sharing Option with a Sub-Account?**

The new sharing option introduces a unified subscription model, allowing an agency having an active premium prospecting subscription to share its Premium subscription with one sub-account. This eliminates the need for duplicate subscriptions and offers more control over billing and access—all from a single place.

If Agencies don't want to share, they can also simply cancel agency level subscription and get a new subscription on any Sub-Account to being fresh prospecting in sub account (needs to be enabled under Reselling Tab in Agency View)

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the New Prospecting Tool Sharing Option**

Agencies can benefit from improved cost-efficiency and simpler workflows with this update:

- **Cost Savings:** Avoid maintaining two separate subscriptions for agency and sub-account.

- **Simplified Subscription Management:** Manage billing and user access for both accounts in one place.

- **Full Feature Access:** Both the agency and the linked sub-account receive complete access to Prospecting Premium tools.

- **Operational Flexibility:** Adjust or change the linked sub-account as business needs evolve.

* * *

## **How To Share Agency Prospecting Premium Subscription with a Sub-Account**

Properly setting up your subscription and linking a sub-account ensures access to all features under a single billing structure.

```
Important: This is a one-time action. You will not be able to change the sub-account later.
```

### **If you have already subscribed to Prospecting Premium at the agency level**

1. Click on **Prospecting** from your agency account.

# How to Remove or Update a Linked Sub-Account in the Agency Prospecting Tool:

Each Agency Prospecting subscription can be linked to one sub-account. If you’d like to remove or update that linked sub-account, here’s how:

### To **remove the linked sub-account** (and not add another):

1. ### Go to **Settings** and unsubscribe **either** at the **Agency** level or at the **linked sub-account** level.

2. This will remove premium access for both.

3. If you’d like to continue without linking a sub-account, simply start a new subscription **without linking any sub-account**.

### To **replace the linked sub-account** with another:

You have two options:

- **Option 1:**

1. Go to **Settings** and unsubscribe at the **Agency** or at the **currently linked sub-account**.

2. Start a new subscription and select the new sub-account to link.
- **Option 2:**

1. Cancel your existing subscription.

2. Start a new subscription directly from the desired sub-account — either through **Reselling** or a **Direct Company Purchase** (explained below).

* * *

## **Upgrading to Prospecting Premium for the First Time:**

You have two ways to upgrade the **Prospecting Tool** to Premium:

## 1\. Agency-Level Prospecting

- Includes all Premium benefits:

  - Unlimited Leads per month

  - Website Widgets

  - Leads POC Enrichment

  - Report Builder

**Important:** Agency-level Prospecting does _not_ include CRM features (e.g., Add to Contacts, Send SMS, Add to Opportunities, Workflow Triggers).

- You will need to move into a **Sub-Account** later if you want CRM functionality.

- **Recommendation:** Start with Prospecting inside a **Sub-Account** to access both Prospecting + CRM features right away.


## 2\. Sub-Account Level Prospecting

- Includes **all Premium benefits** _plus_ CRM capabilities:

  - Add prospects to Contacts

  - Send SMS

  - Add to Opportunities

  - Trigger Workflows

### **How to Enable Prospecting in a Sub-Account**

You can enable it in three ways:

1. **From the Reselling Tab**

   - Go to **Agency View > Reselling Tab**

   - Save & enable the toggle for **Re-sell Prospecting![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053443359/original/bIIB6n4lo_MN4Pvecai6IVaCsnoPJOEbWg.png?1757492086)**
2. **Direct Company Purchase**

   - Purchase Prospecting Premium directly at the Sub-Account level.

3. **Upgrade from Agency Prospecting Tool**

   - Navigate to **Prospecting** from your Agency Account and upgrade from there.

   - Click on the **Upgrade Now** button under **Premium Plan**.

   - You will be prompted to: **Select a Sub-Account** now, or **Continue without linking**: Select a sub account by typing its name

* * *

**Best Practice:** For full functionality and CRM integration, always start your subscription in a **Sub-Account**.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Where can I link a sub-account to a Premium subscription?**

This action can only be performed within the Agency Prospecting section.

**Q: Can I link more than one sub-account to my Prospecting Premium subscription?**No, only one sub-account can be linked per agency subscription.

**Q: Can I change the linked sub-account later?**

No, linking a sub-account is irreversible. Once it’s linked, you won’t be able to change it.

**Q: Do both the agency and the sub-account get full access to Prospecting Premium?**Yes, both accounts receive complete access under a single subscription.

**Q: What if I want to subscribe without linking a sub-account?** You can choose to continue without linking during setup and link later from the subscription settings.

**Q: What happens if the selected sub-account already has an active Premium subscription?**

If the sub-account already has an active Premium subscription, we’ll automatically adjust your billing and cancel any duplicate subscription to prevent extra charges.
