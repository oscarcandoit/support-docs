Modified on: Thu, 11 Sep, 2025 at 3:35 PM

Resources in Services let you reserve the real-world assets needed to deliver an appointment, like rooms, chairs, or stations, so booking stays accurate. This article covers what resources are, when to use them and how to set them up.

# **Overview of Resources in Services**

**Resources** represent physical assets such as rooms, chairs, or stations that are required to deliver a service. Assigning resources to services ensures that when the service is booked, the associated resource is also reserved — preventing double bookings and keeping availability accurate.

Resources should be created **only when availability matters**. For example:

- A **scissor** does not need to be created as a resource for a haircut, since there are usually plenty.

- A **haircut chair** should be created as a resource if there are only 2 chairs available. Even if 3 staff are free, only 2 appointments can be booked simultaneously because of the chair limitation.


```
Note: Currently, each service can book only one resource at a time, but you can assign multiple resources (e.g., Chair 1 and Chair 2). The system will automatically book any available one of them.
```

## **Key Benefits of Resources**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide where you can use resources to add the most value in your scheduling processes.

- **Fewer Scheduling Mistakes:** Prevents double-booking so you avoid last-minute cancellations, reschedules, and unhappy customers.

- **Control Capacity:** Resources can limit how many appointments are allowed at the same time, based on their defined capacity.

- **Less Manual Oversight:** Automatically reserves the required asset when a service is booked, freeing your team from constant checks.

- **Keeps Appointments Moving:** When multiple equivalent resources are assigned, the system books any available one so one busy room or chair doesn’t stall the schedule.


* * *

## **Capacity vs. Quantity**

It’s important to distinguish between **resource quantity** and **resource capacity**:

- **Quantity**: Create a separate resource for each physical unit (e.g., Room 1, Room 2, Room 3).

- **Capacity**: Set how many people/appointments that unit can handle at once (e.g., Room 1 has a capacity of 4).


Example:

- A spa has 3 rooms → create 3 resources: _Spa Room 1, Spa Room 2, Spa Room 3_.

- If _Spa Room 1_ can host 4 people at the same time → set its **capacity** to 4.


* * *

## **How to Create a Resource**

Use the steps below to set up a resource—details, timing, pricing, staff, and preview—so your booking page is accurate and ready to share.

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to + New Resources

- Navigate to the Resources Page ( **Calendar** \> **Calendar** **Settings** \> **Services** \> **Resources**)

- Click the **\+ New Resource** button in the upper right corner

#### **Step 2:** Add Resource Details

- Enter the **Resource Name** and optionally a description.

- **Select Service(s)** that will use this resource.

- **Select Location(s)** where the resource is available.

- Define the **capacity** for each location (if multiple).

- Save your changes by clicking the blue **Create** button


Once created, the resource will be automatically reserved whenever its associated services are booked.

## **Assigning Resources to Services**

When creating or editing a resource, you’ll need to:

- **Assign Services** – Select which services require this resource.

- **Assign Locations** – Choose where the resource is available (useful if you operate multiple locations).

- **Set Capacities** – Define the maximum capacity for each location for flexible scheduling.


You can assign resources either from the **Services tab** or directly in the **Resources tab**. Once linked, the system will automatically block off that resource whenever its assigned service is booked. If the resource is not available at the requested time, the appointment cannot be scheduled.

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- Only create resources for **real limiting factors** (e.g., treatment rooms, chairs, machines).

- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., _Spa Room 1_, _Haircut Chair 2_).

- Always set the correct **capacity** to avoid overbooking.

- Assign resources consistently across locations to keep scheduling accurate.


Resources make sure your services are not just staff-dependent, but also tied to the **real-world assets** required to deliver them. This ensures smoother scheduling, accurate availability, and a better customer experience.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: I don’t see the Resources tab—how do I turn it on?**

Make sure **Services** is enabled for your sub-account. [Click here to learn how to turn on Services](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000006240)

**Q: Can a service book more than one resource at a time?**

No. A service can book only one resource at a time. You can assign multiple resources to the service, and the system will book any one that’s available.

**Q: What happens if the required resource is unavailable?**

The time slot will not be offered; the appointment cannot be scheduled at that time.

**Q: What’s the difference between Rooms/Equipment and Resources in Services?**

Rooms & Equipment are managed under Calendar Rooms & Equipment to prevent double-bookings at the calendar level, while Resources live inside Services and are tied to service bookings. They’re separate setups—choose the one that best fits your workflow.

**Q: Why isn’t my service showing on the public booking page?**

Check if the service is set to Private. Private services don’t appear on the public booking page; share the direct link instead.
