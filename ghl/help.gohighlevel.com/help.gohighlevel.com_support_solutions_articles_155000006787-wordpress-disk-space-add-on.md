# **What is the Disk Space Add-On for WordPress Hosting?**

The Disk Space Add-On lets you expand WordPress storage on demand in +25 GB increments, no plan upgrade required. This flexibility allows agencies to right-size capacity as sites grow, ensuring uninterrupted performance while maintaining predictable, transparent billing.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Disk Space Add-On**

- **Flexible scaling**: Increase storage in +25 GB blocks exactly when needed.

- **Plan independence**: Expand capacity without upgrading the entire hosting plan.

- **Operational continuity**: Avoid space-related interruptions to uploads, backups, or updates.

- **Centralized management**: Access add-ons and usage from Agency → Reselling → WordPress → Manage.

- **Cost clarity**: Simple pricing at $12/month per +25 GB; add multiple blocks as needed.

- **Control & safety**: Disable unused add-ons when at least 25 GB is free, preventing accidental capacity shortfalls.
