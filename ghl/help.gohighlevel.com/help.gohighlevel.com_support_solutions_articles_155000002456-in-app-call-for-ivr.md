#### **What is In app call for IVR?**

Previously, our IVR system only allowed calls to be routed to phone numbers. Now, we've added a feature that lets you route these IVR calls to either a staff member's mobile phone or their GHL app (both web and mobile versions).

#### **How to configure?**

- Go to Settings -> My staff
- Click on Edit and go to "Call & Voicemail Settings" section.
- Select from a set of options in the "Default channel for IVR"
- Web app - Receive IVR calls on GHL web app
- Mobile app
- My Phone number
