## Overview

The **Task Notification** action allows you to create a new task with a defined due date that will be assigned to a specific user. This is particularly useful for ensuring team members are aware of tasks that need their attention.

## Action Name

**Task Notification**

## Action Description

This action creates a task within the system, assigns it to a user, and defines a due date by which the task must be completed. You can specify task titles, assign users, set descriptions, and establish deadlines, ensuring task management is easy to organize.

## Action Details

### **How to configure:**

1. **Action Name:** Give the task an appropriate name such as "Add Task" to reflect its purpose.
2. **Title:** Enter the task title that will be visible to the user.
3. **Description:** Provide detailed information about the task. This is what the user will see to understand their assignment.
4. **Assign To:** Select the user or team member to whom the task will be assigned.
5. **Due In:** Define the deadline for the task using predefined durations (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, or immediate).

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field Name | Description | Mandatory |
| Title | Title of the task to help users identify it. | Yes |
| Description | Detailed description of the task, providing context and guidance to the assigned user. | No |
| Assign To | Select the user to whom the task will be assigned from the available list of users. | Yes |
| Due In | Set the deadline for the task (e.g., in 1 day, 2 days, 5 days, or "Now" for immediate tasks). | Yes |

## Example

Let’s say you want to assign a task to a team member, John, to follow up with a lead. You can configure the action as follows:

- **Action Name:** Add Task
- **Title:** Follow-up with Lead XYZ
- **Description:** Call Lead XYZ and check on the progress of their onboarding process.
- **Assign To:** John Doe
- **Due In:** 2 Days

In this case, John will receive the task in the system, and it will be due within 2 days.
