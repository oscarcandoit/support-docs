# Labs Features in Sub-Accounts

Modified on: Tue, 9 Sep, 2025 at 9:30 AM

# **What is Sub-Account Labs?**

Sub-Account Labs is the local, early-access area inside a single sub-account where admins can toggle eligible features on for just that workspace. It’s designed for quick, low-risk trials—letting teams test behavior, confirm compatibility, and prepare SOPs without affecting other clients or locations.

- **Scope:** Changes apply only to the current sub-account; other sub-accounts are unaffected.

- **Who can enable:** Sub-account Admins (and Agency roles when acting inside the sub-account).

- **Where to find it:** Sub-account view → **Settings** → **Labs**.

- **When to use:** Fast evaluations, team-specific validation, and training prep prior to wider rollout.

```
IMPORTANT: To learn more about Agency and Sub-account Labs, read the complete overview article here.
