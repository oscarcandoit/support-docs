# **What is Review Request Balancing?**

Review Request Balancing allows you to distribute review requests between multiple review platforms, such as Google and Facebook. Users can configure the ratio for redirection, ensuring a more even split of reviews across platforms.

**For example:**

- When Review Balancing is enabled for the first time, the default ratio is **50% Google** and **50% Facebook** _(if both pages are integrated)_.

- You can adjust the redirection percentages to suit your business needs.

* * *

# **Why is Review Request Balancing Important?**

- **Diversify Online Reviews:** By distributing reviews across platforms, you enhance your visibility and credibility across multiple online spaces.

- **Strengthen Reputation:** Balancing reviews ensures your presence is not overly reliant on one platform, providing a more comprehensive online reputation.

- **Increase Customization:** The feature lets you align review requests with your business goals by adjusting redirection ratios as needed.

* * *

# **How To Setup Review Request Balancing**

### **Step 1:** Enable Review Balancing

1. Navigate to Reputation > Settings > Review Link.

2. Toggle the **Enable Review Balancing** option.

### **Step 2:** Configure GBP Page (Google Business Profile)

1. Under Reputation > Settings > Review Link, locate the **Get Reviews on Google** section on the left panel.

2. Use the **Select Page** dropdown on the right panel to choose the Google Business Profile (GBP) page for review distribution.

```
IMPORTANT: If you have not yet integrated your Google Business Profile or your Facebook Business page, you will not be able to setup review distribution to those channels.

In order to setup your GBP and Facebook integrations go to SETTINGS > INTEGRATIONS
```

### **Step 3:** Configure the Balance

1. After enabling Review Balancing, click on **Configure Balance**.

2. Adjust the ratio of redirection between Google and Facebook as desired.

**For example:**

- 70% Google & 30% Facebook.
- Or any other custom distribution.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if only one platform is integrated?**

If only one platform (e.g., Google) is integrated, all review requests will automatically redirect to that platform until another platform (e.g., Facebook) is integrated.

**Q: Can I disable Review Balancing once it’s enabled?**

Yes. To disable Review Balancing:

1. Go to Reputation > Settings > Review Link.

2. Toggle off the **Enable Review Balancing** option.

Disabling the feature will redirect all review requests to the default platform (e.g., Google) if it’s the only integrated option.

**Q: Can I edit the redirection ratio after it’s been configured?**

Yes, you can adjust the ratio at any time by:

1. Going to Reputation > Settings > Review Link.

2. Clicking on **Configure Balance** and modifying the ratio.

**Q: What if I don’t configure a balance after enabling the feature?**

If you don’t configure a balance, the system will default to a 50%-50% split between Google and Facebook (if both platforms are integrated).

**Q: How do I know the current distribution of reviews?**

The **Configure Balance** modal displays the current distribution percentages, allowing you to monitor and adjust as needed.

**Q: Are there analytics for reviewing performance across platforms?**

While Review Balancing focuses on redirection, analytics on performance and the number of reviews generated per platform can be viewed in the **Reputation** module.
