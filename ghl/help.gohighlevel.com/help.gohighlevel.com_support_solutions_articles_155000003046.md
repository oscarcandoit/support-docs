Arrangement of products within the Product list page was an issue. Buyers always faced issue with the discoverability of products and as a store owner this was a bottleneck. To tackle this problem, store owners can now add the sort and filter option in the product list page.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

- [Images:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003046#Images%3A)

## **How to use:**

1. Navigate to the product list page, and select the product list element. There would now be 2 toggles to enable Sorting and Filtering. Enable them to add Sort & Filter elements to your Product List page.
2. Configure properties for the sort and Filter. Some of the properties that can be configured are:

- Sort and filter text color
- Sort and filter pill color
- Reset button color

3. Click on save/Publish to view your changes in your site!

## **Some key aspects:**

- Sort and filter options are only available in the product list page
- Default sort order is Date - Old to new
- By default all products will be shown without any filters
