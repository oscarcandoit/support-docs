## **What are Carousel Ads?**

Carousel ads are an effective way of telling a story, highlighting different products, or showcasing various features of a single product. They engage users more actively than static ads, allowing for a more interactive experience.

It is a type of ad format that allows marketers to showcase multiple images or videos in a single ad unit. Users can swipe through the different cards, each of which can feature its own image, video, headline, description, and link.

## **What are the benefits of Carousel Ads over static advertisements?**

The two ad formats are incomparable, but when it comes to usability and effectiveness, here are some key advantages of carousel ads:

- **Improved Engagement:** Carousel ads can enhance user's advertising strategy by making the ad content more engaging and effective.
- **Increased Click-Through Rates**: Users are often more likely to click on carousel ads since they can see more options at once, which can lead to higher click-through rates compared to single-image ads.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The swipe-able format is well-suited for mobile users, who represent a significant portion of Facebook's audience.
- **Cost-Effective**: By showcasing multiple products in one ad, you may reduce the overall cost per click (CPC) compared to running several individual ads.

## **How can I create a multi-media or carousel ad campaigns in Ad Manager?**

In the campaign creation process, when defining the Ad Content in the initial step, the existing media section offers two options under the media type sub-section: Single and Carousel.
