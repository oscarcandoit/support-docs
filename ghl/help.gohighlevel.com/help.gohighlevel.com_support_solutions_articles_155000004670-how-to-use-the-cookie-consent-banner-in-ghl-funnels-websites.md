### Using Regex Patterns

You can use regex patterns to match multiple cookies, such as:

- ga-\* – Matches all cookies starting with "ga-" (e.g., ga-1234, ga-3241).

- \_fbp – Matches Meta Pixel cookies.

- \_ga.\* – Matches all Google Analytics cookies.

### Scanning Your Website for Cookies

1. Temporarily disable the Cookie Consent Banner.

2. Use a free tool like [CookieServe](https://www.cookieserve.com/) to scan your website.

3. Review the detected cookies and assign them to the correct categories.


Important: Disable the banner before scanning, as it blocks non-essential cookies, preventing a complete scan.

* * *

## Integrating with Marketing Tools

To ensure proper tracking, categorize cookies correctly:

- Advertising – Facebook Pixel (fbp, \_fbc), other ad platform cookies.

- Analytics – Google Analytics (ga, \_gid), Google Tag Manager, other tracking tools.


For integration details, refer to the [Marketing Tools to Use in Funnel & Website Cookie Banner](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002126-marketing-tools-to-use-in-funnel-website-cookie-banner)article.

## Best Practices

- Regularly scan your website for new cookies.

- Provide clear, simple descriptions for each cookie.

- Use regex patterns to organize similar cookies.

- Ensure marketing tool cookies are correctly categorized.

- Keep cookie expiration settings accurate and up-to-date.


By following these practices, you can help address privacy law requirements while giving users more control over their data.

> **⚠️** **Please note that using this tool does not guarantee compliance with any specific law.**
