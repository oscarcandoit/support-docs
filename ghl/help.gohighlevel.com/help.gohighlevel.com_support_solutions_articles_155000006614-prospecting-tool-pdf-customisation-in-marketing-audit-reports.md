# **What is PDF Customization in Marketing Audit Reports?**

PDF Customization allows you to apply your Brand Theme, header, and footer settings from the Prospecting Report Builder directly to exported PDF audits. Every PDF automatically mirrors your web report’s branding, no extra design work required. This creates a seamless prospect experience and saves valuable setup time.

```
Note: This feature requires Premium Prospecting subscription. Preview mode is free of cost for both Agencies & Locations.
