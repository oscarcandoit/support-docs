## **Platform Settings -** **Meta**

The Meta section includes four key tabs:

1\. **Ad Account**

- Displays connected Meta Ad Account with name, account ID, status, and currency.
- You can delete the account to reset the setup. On deletion:

  - All campaigns become hidden (not deleted).

  - You’ll be redirected to the onboarding screen to reconnect a Meta account.

  - Reconnecting the same ad account restores all data.

2\. **Pages**

- View all connected Facebook Pages.
- Add new pages using **"Connect Facebook Page(s)"**. Only those pages that are part of the connected Facebook account will be available to be connected.

- Delete a page by clicking the trash icon beside it. This will:

  - Unlink the page.

  - Retain previously published ads (which can no longer be edited from HighLevel).

  - Restore campaign visibility if the page is reconnected.
