# **What is Multiple Ad Groups in Google Ads Campaigns?**

Multiple Ad Groups in Google Ads campaigns let you structure your campaign with up to 10 separate ad groups. Each ad group targets a specific set of keywords or audience segment and can include up to 3 ads. This allows for more flexible, granular targeting and improved performance visibility — all managed directly inside HighLevel’s Ad Manager.

# **Key Benefits of Multiple Ad Groups**

**Smarter structuring and better insights for your campaigns**

Using multiple ad groups gives you flexibility in targeting and allows more controlled experimentation. Here are the key benefits:

- Create up to **10 ad groups** per campaign to target different products, services, or audiences.

- Add up to **3 ads per ad group** for structured A/B testing.

- Set a **base URL** per ad group to maintain consistency while allowing unique display paths.

- Generate **keyword suggestions** and select match types for precise targeting.

- Track **performance at multiple levels**: campaign, ad group, ad, and keyword.

- Easily **manage** (duplicate, delete, add) ad groups and ads using the ellipsis (⋮) menu.

- Use the **Review screen** to preview your full campaign setup before publishing.


# **How To Use Multiple Ad Groups in Google Ads Campaigns**

**Learn how to set up and manage multiple ad groups in your Google Ads campaigns to maximize targeting and testing opportunities**

Follow these steps to create a campaign with multiple ad groups:

1. **Start a Campaign**

   - Go to the **Ad Manager** and create a new campaign or select a pre-built template.
2. **Set Campaign-Level Settings**

   - Define your **bid strategy**, **daily budget**, and **audience/network preferences**.
3. **Configure Ad Groups**

   - For each ad group:

     - Enter a **website base URL** to generate keyword suggestions.

     - Select or manually enter keywords with desired **match types** (Phrase, Exact, Broad).

     - Add up to **3 ads per ad group**.

     - Manage ad groups using the **ellipsis menu** to duplicate, delete, or add groups.
4. **Configure Ads**

   - For each ad:

     - Add up to **15 headlines**.

     - Add up to **4 descriptions**.

     - Set the **display URL**.
5. **Review and Publish**

   - Use the **Review** screen to check your entire campaign structure across all ad groups and ads.

   - Click **Publish** when ready.
6. **Analyze Performance**

   - Go to the **Ad Manager Statistics** screen.

   - View campaign performance.

   - Click on the campaign name to drill down and see stats by **ad group**, **ad**, and **keyword**.

# **Campaign Structure Overview**

**Understand how campaign levels are organized and why this structure helps improve clarity and performance tracking**

The campaign flow is now clearly separated into 3 intuitive levels:

1. **Campaign**

   - Set budget, bidding strategy, and target audience.
2. **Ad Group**

   - Define keyword targeting and base URL.

   - Manage ads within the group.
3. **Ad**

   - Configure creative elements such as headlines, descriptions, and display path.

This modular approach allows better **targeting**, easier **testing**, and more actionable **insights** — especially useful for agencies managing multiple clients or complex advertising strategies.

**Q: How many ads can I create in each ad group?**

Each ad group can have up to **3 ads**.

**Q: Can I set a different base URL for each ad?**

**Q: Can I duplicate an entire ad group?**

Yes, use the **ellipsis (⋮) menu** to duplicate ad groups for faster setup.

**Q: Can I see performance by ad group or keyword?**

Yes — the Statistics screen now supports **performance breakdowns by campaign, ad group, ad, and keyword**.

**Q: Can I use different match types within the same ad group?**
