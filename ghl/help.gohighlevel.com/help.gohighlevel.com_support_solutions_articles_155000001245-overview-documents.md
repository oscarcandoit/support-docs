# Overview - Documents

Modified on: Mon, 23 Oct, 2023 at 7:02 AM

Adding, sharing, and requesting documents from contacts have never been easier. Documents aim to streamline the entire document management and sharing requirements for your business. Documents are broadly categories into 3 categories:

1. Internal Documents
2. Sent to Contact Documents _(coming soon)_
3. Received from Contact Documents _(coming soon)_

**In This Article**

## Internal Documents

Store documents for your contacts within the CRM on the Contact details page. These documents can be accessed by users who have access to view the contact.

Documents added to custom fields are added to a Folder named "Custom Fields" in the "Internal" section.

Documents in custom fields are non deletable
