## Overview

The **User Login** trigger is designed to initiate specific actions within a workflow when a user logs into their account in the Legacy Portal. This trigger is particularly useful for tracking user activity, sending login notifications, or triggering personalized actions based on login events.

## Trigger Name

**User Login**

## Trigger Description

The **User Login** trigger activates a workflow whenever a user logs into their account. This can be used to automate actions such as sending a welcome back email, tracking login frequency, or triggering reminders or offers upon login.

## How to Configure

To configure the **User Login** trigger, you simply need to set the workflow trigger name. Additional filters can be added if you want to further refine the conditions under which this workflow is triggered.

#### **Fields and Their Properties**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Description | Mandatory |
| Workflow Trigger Name | Name given to the trigger for easy identification. | Yes |

## Example

In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when a user logs into their account:

1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** Courses` User Login`

#### **Example Workflow**

When a user logs into their account, the following actions could be triggered:

- **Send a Welcome Back Email:** Automatically send a personalized email welcoming the user back to their account.
- **Trigger a Personalized Offer:** If the user hasn’t logged in for a certain period, automatically trigger a special offer or reminder.

This configuration ensures that the workflow activates every time a user logs in, allowing for real-time engagement and personalized communication.
