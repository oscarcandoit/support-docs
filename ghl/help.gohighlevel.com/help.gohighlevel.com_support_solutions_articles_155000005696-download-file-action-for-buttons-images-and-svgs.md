# **What is the Download File Action?**

With the Download File Action, any button, image, or SVG becomes a direct bridge between your media library and your audience. Visitors simply click and instantly receive the file, no link copying, redirects, or external storage required. The entire experience is powered inside the intuitive HighLevel builder, so you can deploy downloads without writing a single line of code.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Download File Action**

Give visitors instant, on‑page access to your resources while reinforcing brand consistency and boosting engagement.

- **Instant Resource Delivery:** Visitors receive your file the second they click, no redirects or delays.

- **No‑Code Simplicity:** Easily enable downloads inside the website builder; no coding required

- **Broad Element Support:** Works on buttons, images, and SVGs, letting you get creative with the design

- **Custom File Names:** Set the filename that appears in the user’s downloads for clear, branded assets

- **Seamless Media‑Picker Integration:** Choose any file already stored in your HighLevel media library

- **Supports Multiple File Types:** Offer PDFs, videos, ZIPs and more. Anything you can upload to the media library can be used be this action

- **Improved user experience:** Keep visitors on the page, shortening funnels and increasing conversion rates


* * *

## **Requirements & Limitations**

Understanding prerequisites prevents confusion and ensures a smooth rollout:

- **Single file per element:** Each button, image, or SVG links to only one downloadable file.

- **File hosting:** Asset must reside in the HighLevel media library for optimal reliability.

- **File‑size cap:** Standard media‑library upload limits apply (see [Media Library Specs & Formats](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001216629))

- **Supported Elements:** Buttons, Images, and SVGs can trigger downloads

- **Supported File Types:** Any format accepted by the media picker (PDF, PNG/JPG, MP3, MP4, DOCX, XLSX, ZIP, etc.)


```
Tip: Need to distribute multiple assets? Compress them into a single ZIP so you can still link just one file.
```

* * *

## **Best Practices for Downloadable Resources**

Follow these guidelines to deliver fast, professional downloads every time.

- **Use Descriptive File Names:** use names such as such as _Brand\_Name\_Checklist.pdf_ to reinforce branding

- **Optimize File Size and Format:** compress images or videos to reduce download times

- **Label the Call‑To‑Action Clearly:** use labels such as _Download Recipe PDF_ so users know exactly what they’ll receive

- **Only Use Final Versions:** Replacing or deleting files in the media library may break saved links used in the Download Action


* * *

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Website Page or Funnel Step

- Click **Sites** in the left‑hand navigation bar

#### **Step 2:** Select Element and set Download Action

## **Troubleshooting the Download File Action**

Resolve common issues quickly and keep user experience seamless:

- **Nothing Happens on Click:** Confirm the Download File action is enabled and a file is attached

- **404 or Broken Link:** Verify the asset still exists in the media library and the URL hasn’t changed

- **File Stalls:** Check the file size against media‑library limits and compress if necessary

- **Need Multiple Files:** Combine assets into a single ZIP and link that file


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I attach more than one file to a single element?**

No. Each element supports only one downloadable file. If multiple files are needed, combine files into a single ZIP file.

**Q: How do I force a file to open in a new tab instead?**

The Download File Action is designed for direct downloads. Use “Open URL in New Tab” if you prefer in‑browser viewing.

**Q: Does this work with dynamic URLs?**

The action supports only static files selected from the media library.

**Q: Will mobile devices behave the same way?**

Yes, though some mobile browsers prompt users to choose an app for opening the file.

**Q: Do I need to store files on an external service like Dropbox or Google Drive?**

No. Simply upload the asset to your HighLevel media library and link it. The Download File Action handles delivery without third‑party services.
