# How to add and manage your customer's cards on file

Modified on: Fri, 22 Aug, 2025 at 10:27 AM

**Overview**

Managing customer payment methods efficiently is essential for streamlining transactions and ensuring a seamless customer experience. This document provides an overview of two key features designed to simplify payment management: adding cards on file and managing cards on file. These features enable businesses to securely fetch cards on file (just the last 3/4 digits and expiry date of the cards are fetched from the provider and shown on the UI), view, and manage customer payment information.

**Where to find?**

Contacts > Contact Details > '$' icon (denotes Payments) > Actions

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040240689/original/WVYWWuJI7Jv4y8Qyp5t3RmJK6pqb9iWUGQ.png?1737533686)**

**How to add a card on file?**

- Click the 'Add Card on File' button under 'Actions'

- Enter the card number, expiration date, and CVV along with the Country

- Verify the information and click 'Add Card'

- It can be done for cards in both live and test mode

**How to view cards on file?**

- Click the 'Manage Cards' button under 'Actions'

- All cards would be fetched from respective providers and their last 3/4 digits along with expiry date would be visible as a list. Note - Cards are not stored and cannot be stored as per compliance, hence the card details are always freshly fetched, from the payment provider, every time the user lands on this modal for any customer

- Each card entry includes the last four digits, expiration date, and any associated label

- Both test and live mode cards would be visible in respective lists

**How to delete cards on file?**

- Identify the card you wish to remove

- Click the **Delete** button next to the card

- Confirm the deletion in the pop-up prompt

- Both test and live mode cards can be deleted from respective lists

- In case a card is in for an active subscription within GHL, the prompt would call this out before confirming the deletion. Even with the prompt if the card is deleted, the subscriptions associated with such a card will have no associated payment method for auto deduction.

Note: As per compliance, we do not store any card data on our end. We securely fetch card details (last 3/4 digits and expiry date along with provider - Visa/MasterCard, etc.) every time the business lands on this modal for any customer. This is fetched directly from the payment provider and the delete action is executed with the help of the payment provider.
