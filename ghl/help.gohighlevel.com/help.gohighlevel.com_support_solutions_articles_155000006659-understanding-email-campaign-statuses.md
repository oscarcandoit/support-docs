## **Email Campaign Statuses**

Email Campaigns are one-time or recurring email sends you can create and manage manually.

Each campaign displays a **Status** to reflect where it is in the creation or delivery process.

| **St** **atus** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft** | The campaign is being created or edited and hasn’t been sent yet. You can continue to modify content or settings before scheduling. |
| **Sent** | The campaign has been successfully delivered to recipients. You can view performance metrics under Statistics. |
| **Failed** | The campaign couldn’t be sent due to an error (e.g., invalid sender email, configuration issues). Review the campaign setup before retrying. |
| **Archived** | The campaign has been manually archived to remove it from the active view without deleting it. You can restore it anytime. |
| **All** | Displays every campaign, regardless of its current status. |

## **Workflow Campaign Statuses**

Workflow Campaigns are automated email sequences triggered by workflow actions.

These campaigns show simpler statuses since they are managed dynamically through automation.

| **Status** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft** | The workflow campaign has been created but not activated yet. You can still make changes to triggers, emails, or actions. |
| **Published** | The workflow campaign is live and running based on your configured triggers. Contacts entering the workflow will receive the emails automatically. |
| **All** | Displays all workflow campaigns, including both draft and published ones. |

## **Bulk Action Campaign Statuses**

Bulk Action Campaigns send mass emails to a list of contacts instantly or in scheduled batches.

Their statuses provide detailed insight into send progress and completion.

| **Status** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft** | The campaign setup is incomplete or waiting to be scheduled. |
| **Queued** | The campaign is lined up and waiting to be processed for sending. |
| **Processing** | The campaign is actively being sent to recipients. |
| **Paused** | The campaign has been temporarily stopped. You can resume it anytime. |
| **Complete** | The campaign has been successfully sent to all recipients. |
| **Cancelled** | The campaign was stopped before completion and will not send to remaining contacts. |
| **All** | Displays every bulk action campaign, regardless of status. |
