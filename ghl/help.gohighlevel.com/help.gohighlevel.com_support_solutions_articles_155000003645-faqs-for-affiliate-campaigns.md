### **Can an affiliate be part of multiple campaigns?**

Yes, an affiliate can be part of multiple campaigns and each campaign will provide a unique affiliate link to the affiliates. Make sure when setting up the products that you don't link the same product across multiple campaigns as this will skew your numbers.

* * *

### **My Affiliate Campaign won't publish. What can I do?**

The green color indicates that the campaign is ' **Live**' and the red color indicates that the campaign is ' **Paused**' (see the image above).

A campaign gets created in a paused state if

- Stripe is not connected
- Affiliates are not added

* * *

### **Where can I find my affiliate Links for each campaign?**

Each affiliate is assigned a unique referral link for every campaign they are involved in, ensuring accurate and seamless tracking of their referrals. To view these links:

1. Go to the **Affiliate** section.
2. Click on the **affiliate name**.
3. Scroll down to the **Active Referral Links** tab.

Here, you’ll find a list of all the campaigns the affiliate is part of, along with their corresponding referral link URLs.

* * *

### **How can I change the domain used for the Affiliate Referral Links?**

If no branded domain is added for the account, the affiliate campaign URL will pick the default domain. Users can add their own branded domain in **Settings -> Business Profile -> Branded Domain**. Once added, the new domain will automatically reflect in all affiliate campaign URLs.

Here you can see the default domain being used for the URL

Head over to settings to add your own Branded Domain

Once Added, Affiliate Campaign URLs will update and use the Branded Domain![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033792534/original/ip-8LP3L2fvscqaBa1E3mcQS6jHhsLT4zA.jpeg?1727696795)
