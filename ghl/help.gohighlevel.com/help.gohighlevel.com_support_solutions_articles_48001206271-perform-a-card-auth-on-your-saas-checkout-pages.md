# Perform a card Auth on your SaaS Checkout pages

Modified on: Tue, 11 Jan, 2022 at 3:13 PM

If you are an agency using SaaS Mode on HighLevel, you may wish to protect your SaaS offer from bad actors trying to signup for your SaaS and misusing it. One best practice is to **always** have a card auth on your SaaS checkout pages.

In this article we will discuss how to enable card auth to protect your SaaS offer from bad actors.

# Old Funnels vs New Funnels

Determine if your SaaS Offer is build using old funnels or new funnels and follow the steps below. You can find this information by going to location view -> sites -> funnels and looking at the list.

New funnels have a version 2 tag next to the funnel name.

# Card Auth of Old Funnels

Go to your funnel step that contains your SaaS product and go to "products" tab

# Card Auth for New Funnels

Go to your funnel step that contains your SaaS product and go to "products" tab

## How does the card authorization work?

Card authorization allows your funnels to validate the funds in a card before proceeding to create a subscription. This is especially useful when you offer a free trial for your subscriptions. It deters bad actors from signing up to your platform and allows only real users with sufficient balance to proceed for the free trial.

## Will my clients be charged for this authorization?

No your clients will not be charged for the authorization because it works by creating a payment intent and immediately refunds it before the charges can be settled. It is only a way to know if the card being used is a real card with sufficient balance.
