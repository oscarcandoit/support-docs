# **What is the Favorites Feature?**

**Streamline Template Access for Better Workflow**

The Favorites feature in HighLevel’s Template Library allows you to mark frequently used templates—such as email, funnel, website, or social planner templates—with a star. This makes it simple to locate and reuse them quickly without searching through your entire library each time.

- **Time-Saving** – Speed up your workflow by reducing time spent searching.

- **Custom Workflow** – Build a personalized template toolkit by curating your favorite items.

- **User-Specific Favorites** – Favorites are tied to your user profile, allowing personalized access.
