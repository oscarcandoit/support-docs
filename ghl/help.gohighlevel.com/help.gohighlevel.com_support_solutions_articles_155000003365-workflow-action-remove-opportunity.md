# **What is Remove Opportunity** **Action****in Workflows?**

The **"Remove Opportunity"** action allows you to delete an opportunity associated with a contact. This action helps keep your pipeline clean by removing opportunities that are no longer relevant. With the latest enhancements, you now have more flexibility in selecting which opportunity to remove:

- **All contact opportunities in the selected pipeline.**

- **Opportunity found or triggered in this workflow.**


This allows for more precise control over opportunity management in your sales workflows.

Note: Once removed, an opportunity can be recovered within 2 months - but only individually, not in bulk. Use this action with caution.
