# **What is Custom Variable Support in Prompt?**

The long-awaited support for custom variables in Voice AI prompts is now available! This feature allows you to personalize Voice AI interactions by dynamically inserting contact-specific details into prompts, making conversations more contextual and engaging.

## **Key Benefits of Custom Variable Support**

Using custom variables in Voice AI prompts enhances the conversation flow and provides several advantages:

- **Personalized Interactions**– Your Voice Agent can now reference specific contact details, making conversations more natural and tailored.

- **Improved Context Awareness**– The Voice AI can fetch and use existing customer details, improving its ability to provide relevant responses.

- **Enhanced Call Experience**– Calls feel more human-like as the agent can use customer names and other relevant information.

- **Seamless Integration**– Custom variables can be easily added using a straightforward tagging format.


## **How to Add Custom Variables to Prompts**

Adding custom variables to your Voice AI prompt is simple. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to Agent Goals**– Navigate to the Voice AI settings in your platform.

5. **Save and Deploy**– Once your prompt is configured, save the changes and deploy your Voice Agent for improved conversations.


## **Best Practices for Using Custom Variables**

To maximize the effectiveness of custom variables, follow these best practices:

- **Use Variables Thoughtfully**– Ensure the variables you use add value to the conversation and improve clarity.

- **Test Before Deployment**– Verify that the custom variables populate correctly in test calls before going live.

- **Keep Prompts Natural**– Avoid overloading prompts with too many variables, as it may make conversations sound robotic.

- **Update Customer Data Regularly**– Ensure that customer details are up-to-date to avoid outdated information being used in prompts.
