# How to fix error "Your phone number isn't eligible to connect to the WhatsApp Business Platform. More activity on the WhatsApp Business App is needed to help determine eligibility." while onboarding for coexistence

Modified on: Tue, 3 Jun, 2025 at 6:54 AM

### **Overview**

If you’re seeing this error while trying to onboard a phone number to the **WhatsApp Business Platform** for Coexistence (Coex), it means that WhatsApp has flagged the number as not having enough business activity to qualify for the platform. To ensure your business is using WhatsApp legitimately and actively, WhatsApp requires some engagement through the **WhatsApp Business App** first.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### 1\. **Start Engaging in Real Conversations**

WhatsApp checks for authentic business usage. Engage in meaningful interactions:

- Send and receive messages with real customers or internal testers

- Use features like **quick replies**, **labels**, and **greeting messages**

- Send different types of content: text, images, documents, etc.

- Respond promptly and keep conversations active for a few days


> Try to maintain daily messaging activity for a month.

#### **2: Retry the Onboarding Process**

After consistent activity:

- Go back to your onboarding tool GHL-> Whatsapp

- Retry connecting your number to the WhatsApp Business Platform


### **Why This Happens**

WhatsApp wants to ensure numbers being onboarded to the **Business Platform (API)** are associated with **legitimate, active businesses**. Without prior message activity, your number won’t qualify until a usage pattern is established.

### **Avoid These Common Mistakes**

- Don’t try to onboard a **fresh or unused number**

- Don’t use a number that hasn’t been registered on the **WhatsApp Business App**

- Don’t delete the WhatsApp Business App too early — maintain activity until onboarding is successful


* * *

### **Tip: Use a Different Number (Optional)**

If you're on a deadline, consider using a different phone number that has:

- Previously been used actively on the WhatsApp Business App

- Already has some customer interactions
