**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

Q: Why is my logo missing on older invoices, but shows up on new ones?

A: Your logo is missing because the original image file was deleted from your Media Library.

Invoices pull the logo from its original file location. If you delete that file, the link breaks for all existing invoices.

How to Fix It:

- For New Invoices: The system is fine; it's using the current logo from your settings.

- For Unpaid Invoices:Upload a new logo to your Media Library and make sure your Business Details are updated with this new image. The logo will reappear on these.

- For Paid Invoices: The logo cannot be fixed because paid records cannot be edited. You would have to manually add the logo to the PDF if you need to resend a receipt.
