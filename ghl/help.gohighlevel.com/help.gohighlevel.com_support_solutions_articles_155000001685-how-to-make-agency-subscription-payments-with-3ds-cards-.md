# How to make agency subscription payments with 3DS cards?

Modified on: Fri, 12 Jan, 2024 at 6:24 AM

Agency subscriptions fail to automatically renew when 3DS cards are added to the account, as 3DS cards require authentication by the card holder in order for the payment to be successfully processed. This article outlines how you can reactivate your subscription after the automatic payment attempt has failed.
