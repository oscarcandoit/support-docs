# **What is Element Templates in Page Builder?**

Element Templates let you capture any single page-builder element—such as a button, headline, or form—along with its styling and save it to a location-wide library. Instead of rebuilding the same element on every page, you can insert the template from the Saved Assets panel whenever you need it.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Element Templates in Page Builder**

- **Consistent branding:** Ensure every funnel and website stays on-brand by reusing the same approved design elements.

- **Faster page builds:** Speed up creation by inserting proven design blocks instead of rebuilding from scratch.

- **Centralized library:** Access all saved templates in one place, available to every user in the location.

- **Style preservation:** Retain fonts, colors, and spacing for pixel-perfect consistency across pages.

- **Simple management:** Easily rename or delete templates whenever updates are needed.
