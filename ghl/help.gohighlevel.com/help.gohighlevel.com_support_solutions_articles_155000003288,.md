## **Troubleshooting Zoom Audio/Video Issues**

If you are experiencing issues connecting to Zoom Audio, have an inaudible speaker, or cannot turn on video, please follow these steps:

### **1\. Move to a Breakout Room**

- If you’re in a meeting and facing issues, try leaving the current meeting room and moving to a breakout room.
- Once in the breakout room, rejoin the main room. This can often reset your audio and video settings.

### **2\. Check Your Microphone and Speaker Settings**

- Click on the microphone icon at the bottom left corner of the Zoom app.
- If the microphone icon is crossed out or muted, click it to unmute.
- Click the up arrow next to the microphone icon to access audio settings and make sure the correct microphone and speaker are selected.

### **3\. Disconnect and Reconnect Audio**

- Click the up arrow next to the microphone icon.
- Select “Leave Computer Audio.”
- When the pop-up appears, click “Join Audio” again to reset the audio connection.

### **4\. Test Your Microphone and Speakers**

- Access Audio Settings by clicking the up arrow next to the microphone and selecting “Audio Settings.”
- Click “Test Mic” to check if your microphone is working properly. Speak into the microphone and watch the audio meter move.
- Click “Test Speaker” to play a test sound and confirm your speakers are functioning.

### **5\. Verify Device Connections**

- Ensure your microphone or speakers aren’t connected to other devices like Bluetooth headphones.
- Check your computer’s settings to confirm that the correct input and output devices are selected for Zoom.

### **6\. Restart Zoom**

- Sometimes a simple restart can fix temporary glitches. Close Zoom completely and reopen it.

### **7\. Test Zoom Page**

- Visit Zoom’s test page to verify your microphone, speaker, and video settings are working correctly. [Click here to visit Zoom's test page.](https://zoom.us/test)

## **Troubleshooting Screen Sharing Issues**

If you cannot share your screen or others cannot see your screen, please try the following troubleshooting methods to try and fix the issues.

### **1\. Move to a Breakout Room**

- If screen-sharing issues persist, try moving to a breakout room and then returning to the main room. This can refresh your session and potentially resolve the issue.

### **2\. Verify Screen Sharing Settings**

- Click the “Share Screen” button at the bottom of the Zoom window.
- Ensure you’ve selected the correct screen or application window to share.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032253928/original/xx_kipcKZiB74BFkWi8oXgeST6FOy_Aj4Q.jpg?1725462133)

### **3\. Check Permissions**

- On Windows: Ensure the Zoom app has permission to record and share your screen.
- On Mac: Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Accessibility tab, and enable “Zoom.”

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032194104/original/aPWLHOr1baOR10YUN7EAQCoMrTpZKm7R6Q.png?1725406965)

### **4\. Restart Screen Sharing**

- If screen sharing isn’t working, click “Stop Share” at the top of the screen.
- Wait a few seconds, then click “Share Screen” again to restart the process.

### **5\. Enable TCP Connection**

- Open the Zoom desktop client and go to Settings > Share Screen.
- Scroll down to the “Advanced” section and enable TCP connection to improve screen-sharing stability.

### **6\. Check Your Network Connection**

- Make sure you have a stable internet connection. Unstable or weak connections can cause screen sharing to lag or fail.
- Run a speed test via fast.com or speedtest.net to ensure a minimum speed of 50mbps for smooth Zoom performance.

### **7\. Update Zoom**

Ensure your Zoom application is up to date. Outdated versions may not support the latest features or might have bugs that affect screen sharing.

## **Troubleshooting Zoom Annotations**

The annotate feature is a tool that allows support reps to add markings on a shared screen to guide users to the correct next step. Zoom currently only supports the annotate feature in the desktop app (after downloading desktop app) when joining the meeting.

To open the Zoom desktop app, select **ALLOW** to open zoom.us to launch the desktop app and get the most out of the zoom experience

If you are unable to annotate on the screen while using the Zoom Browser, try the following methods to troubleshoot the issue.

### **Reinstall the Zoom App**

- Download the Zoom App: https://zoom.us/download
- Once downloaded, rejoin the Zoom Room through the app for a better experience.
- If the issue persists after trying these steps, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us for further assistance.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: Why do I need to move to a breakout room to fix issues?**

Moving to a breakout room and returning to the main session forces Zoom to refresh your session, which can help reset your audio, video, or screen-sharing configurations. It's a quick way to resolve session-related glitches without needing to restart Zoom.

### **Q: How can I prevent recurring Zoom audio or video issues in future meetings?**

Recurring issues can often be avoided by ensuring your Zoom app is up to date, regularly checking your microphone and camera connections, and testing them before the meeting starts using Zoom’s test page. Additionally, stable internet connections play a big role in preventing issues.

### **Q: Why does my screen sharing stop or become slow during a meeting?**

Screen-sharing performance can be impacted by a weak or unstable internet connection, especially if bandwidth is being used by other programs or people in your network. Check your internet speed and consider closing other programs that might be consuming bandwidth during your Zoom call.

### **Q: Can Zoom settings differ between operating systems like Mac and Windows?**

Yes, there are some differences in how Zoom interacts with Mac and Windows systems, particularly when it comes to privacy and security permissions for screen sharing or accessing your microphone/camera. Always double-check the system-specific instructions for granting Zoom the necessary permissions.

### **Q: Why does Zoom require frequent updates, and what happens if I don’t update?**

Zoom frequently releases updates to improve functionality, security, and compatibility with new features. If you don’t update regularly, you might miss out on important fixes and new features, and your performance on Zoom may degrade, including issues with audio, video, and screen sharing.

### **Q: Why does restarting Zoom fix most issues?**

Restarting Zoom clears temporary cache files and refreshes the application’s connection to your system's hardware (microphone, camera, etc.). It also re-establishes a clean connection to Zoom’s servers, which can resolve many common issues caused by temporary glitches.

### **Q: How can I ensure my Zoom screen sharing works before an important meeting?**

Before your meeting, you can use Zoom's test meeting feature to practice sharing your screen and ensure everything is working smoothly. Additionally, check your system permissions for screen sharing and verify that no other applications are using your camera or microphone.

### **Q: What should I do if reinstalling Zoom doesn’t fix the issue?**

If reinstalling Zoom doesn’t resolve your problem, it might be an issue with your system’s compatibility, network, or a deeper issue with Zoom’s configuration. In this case, you should reach out to Zoom support or escalate the issue following HighLevel's escalation protocol.

### **Q: How can I tell if my network connection is causing Zoom issues?**

You can run a speed test using websites like [speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/) to check your internet speed. If your download and upload speeds are below 50mbps or your connection is unstable (frequent drops in speed), this could be the cause of audio, video, or screen-sharing problems.

### **Q: Why can’t I annotate on screen when using Zoom?**

Zoom annotations may not work if you are using the browser version instead of the desktop app, or if your app is outdated. Ensure you have installed the latest version of the Zoom desktop app and check if annotations are enabled in your meeting settings.

### **Q.****Whom can I speak to on Zoom?**

You can speak to **official HighLevel customer support representatives** via Zoom.

- Zoom sessions are available for verified customers needing real-time help.

- These sessions are meant for troubleshooting, setup assistance, or technical guidance.
