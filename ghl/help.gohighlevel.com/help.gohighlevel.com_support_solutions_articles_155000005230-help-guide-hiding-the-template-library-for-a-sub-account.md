# **What is Template Library Visibility Control?**

Template Library Visibility Control lets Agency Admins decide whether a sub‑account can access the Template Library at all, and if allowed, which products (modules) the sub‑account can browse. This setting reduces distractions for location users and helps agencies standardize how templates are used across accounts.

- Configure per sub‑account from the Agency view.

- Choose to **Hide**, **Show**, or **Hide for specific products**.

- Changes apply instantly and affect **location (sub‑account) users**.


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Template Library Visibility Control**

- **Granular Control:** Hide the entire library, show all, or expose only selected products to a sub‑account.

- **Cleaner Experience:** Remove irrelevant templates so location users see only what they need.

- **Policy Enforcement:** Prevent misuse or off‑policy templates in specific modules.

- **Faster Onboarding:** Guide users to approved templates and reduce how‑to questions.

- **Instant Changes:** Updates take effect immediately after saving.


* * *

## **Access & Permissions**

Proper role access is required to configure visibility, and scope differs for Agency vs. sub‑account users. This context prevents confusion about who sees what.

- Only **Agency Admins** can configure Template Library visibility for sub‑accounts.

- **Agency users/admins** always see the Template Library in every location. Restrictions apply **only to location (sub‑account) users**.

- **System Email templates** are always visible to users, regardless of visibility settings.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do agency‑level users lose access when I hide the library?**

No. Agency users/admins always see the Template Library in all locations.

**Q: Are System Email templates affected by these settings?**

No. System Email templates are always visible.

**Q: Can I apply the same visibility to many sub‑accounts at once?**

Not at this time. Configure visibility per sub‑account.

**Q: Do changes affect existing assets already created from templates?**

No. Hiding the library restricts browsing/importing new templates. Assets already created from templates in the sub‑account remain available for editing.
