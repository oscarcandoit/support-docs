# **What is the Appointments List View?**

The **Appointments view** gives you a complete overview of all rental listings that have been booked. Each row in this list represents **one listing** from a booking — not the booking as a whole.

If a booking includes three listings, the system creates three separate rows in the Appointments table, one for each listing. This helps you monitor each item’s timing, payment, and completion individually.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Appointments List View**

- **Customizable Listings with Variants and Inventory:** Create listings for each rental offering — define durations, quantity, pricing, and variants (e.g., size, equipment type, etc).

- **Support for Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly Rentals:** Configure bookings to be charged for hours, days, weeks, or even months, perfect for businesses with flexible rental needs.

- **Inventory Tracking & Availability Control:** Manage how many units of each listing are available at any given time — whether it’s a single item or bulk inventory.

- **Flexible Pricing Models:** Support for fixed duration/flexible duration pricing, seasonal pricing, tiered discounts by duration & quantity, security deposit options, and more.

- **Multi-Item Bookings:** Customers can book more than one listing in a single checkout — perfect for events, combos, or bundled rental experiences.

- **Built-in Payments and Invoicing:** Collect payments directly from the booking flow and generate invoices automatically for each booking. Setup security deposit as per your business needs.

- **Customer Booking Page:** Offer customers a streamlined booking experience with a dedicated public-facing booking page that displays your listings, categories, pricing and availability in real-time.

## **Appointments Table Overview**

The Appointments Table displays every listing booked across all customers and bookings. It’s designed to give a detailed breakdown of your active, upcoming, and completed rentals.

#### **Columns Explained**

- **#** – Serial number for reference.

- **Contact** – Customer name and email address associated with the booking.

- **Listing** – The name of the listing booked. For multi-listing bookings, each listing appears separately.

- **Start Time / End Time** – The duration of the rental for that listing.

- **Status** – Indicates the current booking state for that listing:





  - **Unconfirmed** – Booking has been received but not confirmed yet.

  - **Booked** – Confirmed and scheduled but not yet started.

  - **Active** – Currently in progress.

  - **Completed** – Finished successfully.

  - **Canceled** – Booking was canceled.
- **Payment Status** – Displays the payment state for that specific listing entry:





  - **Pending** – Payment has not been received yet.

  - **Paid** – Payment has been fully collected.

```
Note: At the overall booking level, the payment status may also show as Partially Paid when only some listings have been paid for.
```

#### **Actions** – Quick access icons:

- **View** – Opens the **entire booking** with all listings and related details.

- **Edit** – Opens the full booking editor where you can add, update listings, manage payments, and notes.


```
Important: Even though each listing appears as a separate row, clicking View or Edit opens the complete booking, including all associated listings, payments, and notes.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why do I see multiple rows for one booking?**

Each row is a listing in the booking. A booking with multiple listings creates multiple rows.

**Q: What does “Partially Paid” mean on a booking?**

Some listings under that booking are Paid, while others remain Pending.

**Q: Can I edit a booking from a row?**

Yes. Click View or Edit in Actions; the full booking opens with all listings, payments, and notes.

**Q: How do cancellations or reschedules appear in the list?**

Canceled listings show Canceled in Status and remain visible under All. Reschedules update the Start/End Time.
