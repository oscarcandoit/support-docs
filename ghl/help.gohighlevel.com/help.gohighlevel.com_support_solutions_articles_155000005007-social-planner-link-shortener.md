# **What is the Link Shortener?**

The Link Shortener is a built-in feature within Social Planner that automatically converts long, complex URLs into shorter, more manageable links in your post preview. While the full URL remains visible in your content editor, the shortened link is displayed in the live preview and in the published post itself.

This functionality helps improve the overall readability and visual appeal of your social content, especially when sharing URLs from blogs, landing pages, or external websites.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Link Shortener**

**Shortened links make your posts look more professional and improve readability.**

    •    Keeps social posts clean and uncluttered by minimizing lengthy URLs.

    •    Improves user experience with visually concise content.

    •    Automatically generates a shortened version of any long URL.

    •    Preview shows how the final post will appear with the shortened link.

    •    Prepares for future tracking of link clicks (coming soon).

    •    Works across all connected social platforms in Social Planner.

## **How to Use the Link Shortener in Social Planner**

**This step-by-step guide shows how to use the Link Shortener while composing social media posts.**

    1\.    Navigate to **Marketing > Social Planner** from the left-hand menu.

    2\.    Click on **Create Post**.

    3\.    In the **post composer**, select the social media accounts where you’d like to publish the post.

    4\.    In the **Content** input box, type your message and paste the long URL you wish to include.

    5\.    Click the **URL Shortener** icon located next to the content editor.

    6\.    Once clicked:

    •    The **preview pane** will show a shortened version of the URL.

    •    The **input field** will still display the original long URL.

    7\.    Review your post, and then choose **Publish** or **Schedule** to send it out at a later time.

## **Notes About the Link Shortener**

**Understand how the Link Shortener behaves and what features are planned for future release.**

    •    **Content Input vs. Preview**: The long URL will remain in the input box so you can always see the full link you’re sharing. However, the shortened version will appear in the preview and be used in the final post.

    •    **Click Tracking Is Coming**: Analytics that show how many users clicked on your shortened links are currently in development and will be available in a future update.

    •    **Auto Conversion**: You don’t need to manually replace the link—just click the shortener icon, and it does the rest for you.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will my social post show the long or short link?**

A: The published post will display the shortened link. The long URL is only visible to you in the content editor.

**Q: Can I customize or rename the short link?**

A: Not yet. The short links are currently auto-generated and not editable.

**Q: Are there analytics available for how many people click the short link?**
