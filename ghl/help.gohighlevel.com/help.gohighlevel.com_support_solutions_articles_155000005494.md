# **What is LaunchPad for Agency Accounts?**

LaunchPad for Agency Accounts is a curated onboarding tool designed specifically for marketing agencies and SaaSpreneurs using HighLevel. Instead of landing in a new Agency Account and having no idea what to do first, this LaunchPad guides new admins through essential setup steps using short tutorial videos and actionable prompts. This approach helps new users understand what to do next, reducing confusion and accelerating their path to success.

LaunchPad for Agency Accounts offers several advantages that help agencies onboard faster and more effectively:

- **Accelerated Onboarding**: Users are guided through key setup actions, reducing the learning curve and time to value.

- **Video-Based Guidance**: Each action includes a short, focused video tutorial, making complex steps easy to follow.

- **Greater Immediate Clarity**: By providing clear, actionable guidance, Agencies are more likely to know exactly what to do next.

## **Use Agency LaunchPad**

Setting up and using the LaunchPad is straightforward, as it is automatically enabled for eligible agency accounts. Here’s how to get started and make the most of it:

1. **Log in** to your HighLevel agency account.

2. **Navigate to LaunchPad** (if you don't see it you can wait for the rollout or ask support to activate it).

3. **Review the Guided Actions**: The LaunchPad presents a series of key onboarding actions. Just start with the one that is most relevant to you.

4. **Click, Watch, Use**: Click on any action to navigate directly to that part of HighLevel, watch the video to learn what to do, then use the platform to perform the action.

5. **Return to LaunchPad**: Navigate back to the LaunchPad.

6. **Track Your Progress**: As you complete actions, the LaunchPad will update to reflect your progress.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Who gets access to the LaunchPad for Agency Accounts?**

A: All agency accounts on the $97, $297, and $497 plans are eligible. Currently, it’s being rolled out on a forward-going basis — meaning only new accounts created after the launch (5th June, 2025) will have access to the new LaunchPad version.

**Q: What if I don’t see the LaunchPad when I log in?**

A: The new LaunchPad is currently rolled out only to accounts created after its launch. So, if your account was created before 5th June 2025, it won’t have access to the new agency LaunchPad.

**Q: Can I access the tutorial videos outside of the LaunchPad?**

A: At this time, the videos are integrated into the LaunchPad experience and are not available as a standalone library.

**Q: How does this impact onboarding for sub-accounts?**

A: Sub-accounts have their own LaunchPad experience, which is similar to the Agency LaunchPad.
