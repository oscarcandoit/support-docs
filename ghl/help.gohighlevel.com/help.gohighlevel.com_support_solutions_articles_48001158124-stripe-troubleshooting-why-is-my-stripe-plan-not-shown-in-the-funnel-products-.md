# Stripe Troubleshooting \| Why is my Stripe Plan not shown in the Funnel Products?

Modified on: Mon, 13 Sep, 2021 at 8:27 AM

Stripe products will not be shown in funnel directly. Please add the products in the settings > payments section first. And then, the products should show in the funnels as well.

Payment feature announcement video: [https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/discussions/topics/48000562840](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/discussions/topics/48000562840)
