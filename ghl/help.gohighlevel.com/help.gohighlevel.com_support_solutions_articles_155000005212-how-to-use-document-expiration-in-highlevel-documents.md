## What is Document Expiration?

Document Expiration is a feature in HighLevel that allows users to set an expiration timeline for documents sent for signature. Once a document reaches its expiration date, it is automatically marked as expired and becomes inaccessible for signing or form completion by recipients. This function supports accuracy and control in time-sensitive workflows such as contracts, onboarding documents, and compliance forms.

## Key Benefits of Document Expiration

Document Expiration is designed to enhance document lifecycle management by introducing time-bound control and communication. It provides administrative teams with greater oversight and accountability.

- Ensures contracts and forms are signed within a valid timeframe

- Prevents outdated or obsolete documents from being acted upon

- Automatically marks expired documents, reducing manual tracking

- Improves visibility with expiration status in the dashboard

- Provides a consistent user experience with on-document expiry notices

- Enables optional reminder notifications to encourage timely action


## How to Enable Document Expiration

This section explains how to activate Document Expiry settings globally at the location level to ensure consistency across all documents.

1. Navigate to Payments > Documents > Settings > Documents

2. Locate the option labeled Document Settings on the left menu

3. Scroll to **Expiration Settings** and **Toggle the switch to activate the feature**

4. Enter the default number of days after which documents should expire (this value can be overridden at the document level)

5. (Optional) Enable reminder notifications to be sent to recipients 1 day before expiry

The countdown begins from the time the document is sent and aligns with the location’s timezone for precision.

## What Happens When a Document Expires?

Once a document reaches its expiration date, several actions take place automatically to ensure clarity and enforceability.

- The document’s status is updated to Expired in the document list view

- Recipients attempting to access the document will see a notification indicating the document has expired

- Signatures or data input will be disabled, preserving the document’s integrity

- Senders may resend the document or contact recipients for further action


## Notifications and Customization Options

Administrators can choose to send recipients a reminder email 1 day before a document’s expiration. These notifications help reduce the risk of delays and incomplete submissions.

Customization options include:

- Subject line

- Email body content

- Branding and sender identification


These reminders can be enabled globally or on a per-document basis, offering full flexibility based on business needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I change the expiry date after the document has been sent?

No. Once a document is sent, the expiry date is fixed. To change it, a new document must be created and sent.

Q: Are reminder emails enabled by default?

No. Reminder notifications must be manually enabled either at the global settings level or per document.

Q: What happens to documents after they expire?

Documents are marked as “Expired” but remain accessible in the dashboard for reference. They can no longer be signed or edited by recipients.

Q: Will recipients be notified when a document expires?

Recipients will see a message on the document page stating that the document has expired. However, there is no automatic post-expiry notification unless configured externally.

Q: Can I disable the Document Expiry feature after enabling it?

Yes. You can return to the settings panel and toggle off the feature at any time.

Q: Is the expiry time based on the recipient’s time zone?

No. Document expiry is calculated using the sender's location timezone to maintain consistency.
