# Delete Phone Number Connected to WhatsApp Coexistence

Modified on: Tue, 29 Jul, 2025 at 11:21 PM

This is a case where the client sub-account that is connected to WhatsApp Coexistence doesn't have the option to disable it.

**Solution:**

In this case, clients are using coexisting for the number. The WhatsApp Coexistence feature allows businesses to use their existing WhatsApp Business App account with LeadConnector's advanced CRM tools powered by WhatsApp Cloud API.

WhatsApp businesses, who primarily use the WhatsApp Business App today, and are looking for advanced tools from Partners to manage conversations at scale or to integrate complex needs such as payments, shipping, and leads management to optimize business outcomes.

So, client can disconnect the integration from their WhatsApp mobile App by clicking on the disconnect button.
