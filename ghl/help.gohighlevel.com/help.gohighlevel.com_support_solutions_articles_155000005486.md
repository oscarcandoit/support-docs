# **What is the Competitor Analysis Report?**

The Competitor Analysis Report is an add-on to the **Marketing Audit Report**. It allows sub-accounts to compare their business listings and review metrics against up to three competitors. This benchmarking tool helps identify gaps, trends, and actionable areas for growth in digital presence and reputation.

## **Key Benefits of the Competitor Analysis Report**

Understanding how your business stacks up against competitors is critical for digital growth. This report provides clarity and direction by surfacing actionable data.

- Benchmark your listings and reviews performance against competitors.

- Identify discrepancies in your business information online.

- Uncover missed opportunities to improve visibility.

- Track competitive trends in local SEO and customer sentiment.

- Make informed, data-backed marketing decisions.

- Re-run the analysis anytime with different competitors for deeper insights.


## **How to Set Up the Competitor Analysis Report**

Activating the Competitor Analysis Report starts with the **Marketing Audit Report**. This ensures that your account has the necessary baseline data for comparison.

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Labs** in your sub-account.

2. Enable the **Marketing Audit Report** toggle.

3. Go to the **Reporting** tab and select **Audit Report**.

4. Click **Generate Report** to run the Marketing Audit Report for the business.

5. Wait for the report to finish processing.


## **Compare Reports Tab**

The Compare Reports tab enables you to easily conduct competitor benchmarking after your Marketing Audit Report has been generated.

Here’s how to use it:

- Navigate to **Compare Reports** inside the Audit Report section.

- Enter the names of **3 distinct businesses** to compare. These should be direct or local competitors.

- Click **Compare Reports**.


The system will automatically analyze your listings and reviews against each competitor and generate a comprehensive Competitor Analysis Report.

## **Listings & Reviews Insights**

Once the Competitor Analysis Report is generated, it provides detailed insights across two main areas:

- **Listings Accuracy**

Highlights where your business has missing, inconsistent, or incorrect listings compared to competitors. This helps ensure your business is visible and accurately represented across directories.

- **Reviews Performance**

Displays comparative review volume, star ratings, and sentiment. You can quickly gauge how your reputation stacks up and where you can focus to improve customer perception.


These insights empower businesses to take immediate action—whether it’s correcting listing information or driving more positive reviews.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use this without generating the Marketing Audit Report?**

No, the Competitor Analysis depends on the Audit Report data. You must generate the audit first.

**Q: What businesses can I add for comparison?**

You can input any businesses that appear in the same market. Ensure they’re distinct and relevant competitors.

**Q: Can I rerun the analysis with different competitors?**

Yes! Simply return to the Compare Reports tab, input new businesses, and generate a fresh comparison.

**Q: How long does the report take to generate?**

It typically completes within a few minutes after submission, depending on data availability.

**Q: Can I export the Competitor Analysis Report?**

Currently, exports are not supported, but screenshots and internal sharing within HighLevel are available.

### **Next Steps**

Once you’ve reviewed your Competitor Analysis, you may want to:

- Update your listings directly in the **Listings Management** section.

- Respond to or request more customer reviews using the **Reputation** tab.

- Generate a new analysis monthly to track progress over time.

- Use the insights to inform your next **Marketing Campaign**.
