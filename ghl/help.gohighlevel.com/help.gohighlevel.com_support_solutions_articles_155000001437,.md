# How to Send Confirmations After a Purchase/Order

Modified on: Mon, 18 Nov, 2024 at 1:01 AM

HighLevel enables businesses to send automated confirmation emails to customers after a purchase. These emails include detailed information about the products purchased and the total amount paid, ensuring clear communication and enhancing the customer experience.

Businesses can also make use of the purchased webhook information to process any external automations using the data sent from workflows using the **Order Submitted** trigger

## **Automated Sales Receipts**

The **Automated Sales Receipts** feature allows you to automatically send confirmation emails to customers after any purchase. These receipts provide a comprehensive overview of the transaction.

    •    **How to Enable Sales Receipts**: Learn how to activate this feature by visiting [How to Enable Sales Receipts for Order Form, Calendar, and Invoice Payments](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000261-how-to-enable-sales-receipts-for-order-form-calendar-and-invoice-payments).

Watch this additional video on how Sales Receipts function here - [Link](https://www.loom.com/share/787359e357df47afa936d7ba5a788d8d)

## **Order Submitted Trigger for Custom Automations**

Use the **Order Submitted** trigger to process external automations using webhook information. This feature lets you integrate with other systems or workflows based on the data sent when an order is submitted.

    •    **Custom Email Templates**: Create custom email templates using the shopping cart element in the email builder. This allows you to send personalized emails that list the products purchased within the email content.

    •    **Learn More**: For detailed instructions, refer to [Standard Triggers—Order Submitted](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001228664-standard-triggers-order-submitted).

## **Additional Resources**

    •    **Video Tutorial**: For a comprehensive overview of these features and guidance on populating products purchased in an order form or e-commerce store, watch this [All-in-One Video Tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/5ae3f67a751f4d35b673f61e4b0de605).
