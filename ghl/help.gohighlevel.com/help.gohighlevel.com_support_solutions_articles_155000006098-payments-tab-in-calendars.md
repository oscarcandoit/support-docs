```

### **Overview**

The **Payments Tab** in the Appointment Modal allows you to manage all payment-related details for an appointment in one place. You can track the amount paid, remaining balance, attendee-wise payment breakdown, transactions, and collect pending payments if needed.

* * *

### **Key Features**

#### 1\. Payment Summary

- **Amount Paid**: Total amount already collected for the appointment.

- **Remaining Balance**: Pending payment that still needs to be collected.

- **Total Amount**: Overall cost of the appointment after discounts/coupons.


#### 2\. Attendee-Wise Payment Details

- See payments at the **individual attendee level** (Booker + Guests).

- Each attendee’s status is shown clearly:

  - **Paid**: Full payment received.

  - **Partially Paid**: Some amount still pending.

  - **Remaining**: Outstanding balance to be collected.

#### 3\. Transaction History

- View a list of all transactions associated with the appointment.


#### 4\. Collecting Remaining Payments

- If a balance is due, you’ll see a **Collect Payment** button.

- Options include:

  - **Charge a Card** – Process credit/debit card payments directly.

  - **Record Manually** – Mark payments collected outside the system (cash, check, etc.).

### **How Payments Work Behind the Scenes**

- When **payments are enabled for a calendar**, an **associated product** is automatically created (visible in the **Products Tab**) with a _Calendar_ tag.

- These **calendar-linked products cannot be deleted directly** from the Products Tab.

- When an appointment is booked, an **order is automatically created** (visible in the **Orders Tab**). You don’t need to manage orders separately; everything can be handled directly from the appointment modal.


* * *

### **Impo Notes**

- The Payments Tab is supported for **all calendars**, except:

  - Appointments booked via older **Service Menu (v1)**.

  - Custom recurring appointments booked directly via the in-app modal.
- If a booking includes **multiple guests**, only **one order** is created for the full group.

- If you **edit an appointment** and add guests (with "Collect Payment for Guest" enabled), a **new order** is created each time you save changes.
