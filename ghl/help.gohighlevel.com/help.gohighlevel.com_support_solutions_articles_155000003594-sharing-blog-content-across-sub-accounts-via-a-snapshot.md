Reusing Blog and Blog post content across multiple sub-accounts just got that much easier! With the power of Snapshots, you can share blog, blog post, authors, category from within the agency settings to any sub-account.

## How will it work in the Parent Sub-Account?

```
The parent sub-account is the origin of the snapshot. Its the sub-account where the snapshot is derived/originated from
```

- Go to the 'Sites' tab > 'Blog'
- Create New Blog  > Add SEO Meta details as Blog Name, Image and brief Description and connect the domain
- Edit your Blog site to your liking with design and style
- Create New Blog Post along with category and author - Published the blog posts to transfer to different location

## How will it work in Agency Settings > Snapshot?

-  Go to Agency view > Snapshots

- ' **Refresh the snapshot**' ( [See guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982583)) or ' **upload the snapshot**' ( [See guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982587))

-  When expanded, all the blog name will display as selectable options.


## How will it work in Child Sub-Account?

```
The Child sub-account is the account where you would like to upload the snapshot into
```

- Go to Sites > Blogs

- Check the Blog, it will show as the status of Draft.

Note - Draft status refers to user needs to add domain details.

- Once the users adds all the blog domain details, user can make all the blog published.
