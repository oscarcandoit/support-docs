## **What is the Image Element in HighLevel Email Builder?**

The Image Element is a drag-and-drop block in Email Builder that lets you insert images directly into your email layout. You can upload new images, use URLs, or pull from your existing file library.

It supports customization options such as resizing, alignment, and linking, allowing you to use images for branding, product showcases, or visual storytelling. The element ensures that your images render correctly across all major email clients and devices.

> **Note:** To optimise load times and maintain email deliverability, use compressed images (under 1MB) in formats like JPG or PNG.

## **Key Benefits of the Image Element**

Adding the Image Element to your email design offers several key advantages:

- Quickly insert high-quality images using simple drag-and-drop functionality.

- Customise width, height, and alignment for balanced layouts.

- Ensure consistent image display across both desktop and mobile devices.

- Maintain a polished, branded look with logos, banners, and visuals.
