## Overview

The **Advanced Builder** is a fully visual, freeform canvas for building automations. Drag, drop, and connect **multiple trigger paths**, **parallel branches**, and **complex logic** in one view—without changing how workflows execute. It’s designed for flexibility, performance, and collaboration.

## Access & Requirements

- **Where:** Open any workflow → toggle to **Advanced Builder** (top-left).

- **Switching views:** You can toggle between **Standard** and **Advanced** on the same workflow. (See **Additional Notes** below for Advanced-only features.)

* * *

## The Canvas:

### Add & connect steps

- Open the **Triggers & Actions** panel.

- Configure from the panel **or** drag items directly onto the canvas.

- Connect nodes by dragging from the connector handle (or the **+** icon).![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055989412/original/neH1lwsEiNitnKprmoJTFVi9jfqESgVFFw.gif?1760459760)


**Tips**

- Multi-select (marquee/Shift-drag) to move blocks of nodes.

- Copy/paste branches **across workflows** to reuse patterns


* * *

## Go-To connections for Triggers & Delinked Nodes (Parallel branches)

### Trigger Go-To (set each trigger’s starting action)

Route a trigger to the **exact action** where it should start.

- **Connect it:** Drag the trigger’s **Go-To** connector onto a target action.

- **How it looks:** Trigger Go-To connections are shown as a **dashed line with an arrowhead** (normal sequential links remain **solid**).

- **Execution Behavior:** When the trigger fires, the workflow **jumps directly** to the target action and continues from there.


![Trigger Go-To example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055755868/original/dwTnP_HwQcmzLK45zwn7Oxc9WNvISZP1pQ.png?1760134183)

### Delinked nodes (independent/parallel branches)

Create branches that don’t need to connect linearly—great for handling multiple triggers or outcomes in one canvas.

- Build an **independent cluster** of actions anywhere.

- Attach a trigger via **Go-To connection** to start on that branch.

- Each branch runs **independently** within the same workflow context.


![Delinked branch example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055755867/original/x7qC1lGEGE-dcEXb3gKSm1t-XB6tFBK3Lg.jpeg?1760134183)

**Visual cues (at a glance)**

- **Solid connector** → normal sequential path

- **Dashed connector with arrow** → **Trigger Go-To** (jump to target action)

- **Isolated cluster** → **Delinked** branch


* * *

## Enable / Disable Nodes

Turn any action/condition **off** for testing—without deleting or rewiring.

- **Disable:** Hover a node → click **pause**.

- **Enable:** Hover again → click **play**.

- **Execution:** Disabled nodes are **skipped**; connections remain intact.

* * *

## Sticky Notes & Color Coding

Use notes to explain logic for teammates and future you.

- Add a note from the **left sidebar**.

- Choose color/style, then enter text.

- Notes support **images and links**.

* * *

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Power Navigation

Open the keyboard icon (top-left) for the full list—Navigation, Tools, View, and Edit.

![Keyboard shortcuts](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055755866/original/jS5kgFi-XYcAbSG8fqWuNvljI1kIzG0Nmg.jpeg?1760134183)

**Examples**

- Arrow keys to move selection

- Cmd/Ctrl + C / V for copy/paste

- Next/Previous action buttons for fast traversa


* * *

## Tidy Up (Auto-layout)

One click to clean up cluttered canvases—great after heavy edits or imports.

* * *

## Workflow Switcher

Navigate between workflows **without leaving the builder**.

- Open the **Workflow Switcher** (left sidebar).

- See recent workflows or **search** by name/tag.

- Clicking a result opens it in a **new tab**—your current canvas stays open.


![Switcher entry point](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055755871/original/Dho5NNvnSv5K45y8vi4bKnclX5f8umMTFg.jpeg?1760134184)![Switcher panel](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055755872/original/hA5bo8dIsuJMnwdxwSCqHYcre8I8CE4pAA.jpeg?1760134184)

## Notes, Limits & Best Practices

- **Single enrollment per contact.** Even with parallel branches, the same contact won’t run **concurrently** through multiple branches of the same workflow.

- **Switching to Standard Builder:** Remove Advanced-only features ( **Trigger Go-To**, **Delinked nodes**, **Disabled nodes**) before switching back.

- **Organize early:** Use color-coded notes and **Tidy Up** to keep complex maps readable.

- **Name clearly:** Give triggers/actions descriptive names (this helps in both canvas and Version History). ===
