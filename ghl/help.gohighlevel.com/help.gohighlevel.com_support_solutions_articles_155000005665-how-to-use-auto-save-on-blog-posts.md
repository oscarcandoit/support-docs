## How To Use Auto Save in the Blog Post Editor

Auto Save is designed to be intuitive and easy to manage. Follow these steps to enable or disable it:

1. Open the Blog Post Editor in your dashboard.

2. In the top action bar, locate the Autosave Toggle.

3. By default, Auto Save is enabled, shown as the tag “Autosave on.”

4. To disable Auto Save:





   - Hover over the “Autosave on” tag.

   - A popover will appear with a Disable Autosave button.
5. When Auto Save is disabled, the tag changes to “Last saved” with a timestamp of your most recent save (e.g., “Last saved May 22, 6:30 PM”).

6. Hover over the “Last saved” tag to see a popover with an Enable Autosave button if you want to turn it back on.

7. Your Auto Save preference is stored in your browser’s local storage and will persist across future sessions on the same browser.

## Important Notes

- The Auto Save preference is browser-specific and saved in local storage under the key: blog-editor-autosave-enabled.

- Your preference does not sync across devices or different browsers.

- If Auto Save is off and no last saved data is available, you’ll see “Autosave off” displayed.
