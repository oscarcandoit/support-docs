# Spa Day, Every Day: Daily Ops Guide

Modified on: Fri, 25 Apr, 2025 at 3:13 AM

Your treatments might be flawless, but what happens at the front desk sets the tone for your entire client experience.

No-shows. Missed calls. Last-minute reschedules. Sticky notes with client requests that get lost under the receptionist’s latte.

That’s where automation steps in—not to replace the warmth, but to make it _consistent._

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- Streamline booking and rescheduling without phone tag

- Automate reminders, confirmations, and missed call responses

- Handle reviews, payments, and follow-ups without the chaos

- Use GoHighLevel to run your spa like clockwork, even on your busiest days


* * *

## Why Front Desk Automation is a Med Spa Must

Clients expect fast, friendly, frictionless experiences.
And you deserve to reclaim your time.

A smartly automated front desk means:

- Fewer missed opportunities

- Happier staff (and clients)

- Lower no-show rates

- Better follow-through and upsell potential

## What to Automate — and How to Set It Up in GHL

### 1. **Bookings & Reschedules**

Let clients self-book appointments via GoHighLevel’s calendar tool.

- Add booking links to your website, IG bio, and Google Business Profile

- Allow rescheduling via text or email reminders


Set up online booking calendars

* * *

### 2. **Reminders & Confirmations**

Use GHL to:

- Send SMS & email reminders 48, 24, and 2 hours before appointments

- Confirm bookings instantly when a client schedules online

- Reduce no-show rate with “Confirm Now” links


* * *

### 3. **Missed Call Text-Back + After-Hours Replies**

If no one answers the phone:

- Trigger an auto-text: “Sorry we missed you! Need help booking or have a question?”

- Include booking link or a prompt to leave a voicemail


[Set up missed call text-back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004605)

* * *

### 4. **Follow-Up & Feedback Collection**

Post-visit, trigger:

- Review requests via SMS/email

- A short feedback form (“How was your experience?”)

- Reminder to book next appointment or check out a new promo


[Build feedback workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004608)

* * *

### 5. **Payments & Upsells**

- Use GHL invoicing for service deposits or retail purchases

- Automate post-visit upsell campaigns (e.g., “Loved your facial? Add microneedling next visit for 20% off.”)

- Track outstanding balances with dashboard alerts


* * *

## Real Spa, Real Results

> “Our front desk used to be chaotic—calls, reschedules, reviews slipping through. After automating 5 key workflows in GHL, it feels like we finally have breathing room. Our team is happier and our revenue is more predictable.”
>
> — Marcella, Clinic Director @ Sculpt Med Spa

## TL;DR Checklist

✅ Let clients self-book + reschedule with links

✅ Automate confirmations, reminders, and follow-ups

✅ Use missed call text-back to rescue every lead

✅ Request feedback + reviews with timed triggers

✅ Upsell post-visit with personalized offers
