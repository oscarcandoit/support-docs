# **Overview of Editing a Booking**

The **Edit Booking** page allows admins to modify existing bookings, manage payments, and make post-creation adjustments. It provides complete visibility into every part of a booking—customer details, listings, invoices, transactions, and booking statuses—all in one centralized place.

From this page, you can:

- Add, update or remove listings and adjust rental durations or quantities.

- Manage payments, security deposits, and invoices.

- Review all financial transactions and payment summaries.

- Change booking and listing statuses or cancel bookings entirely.


This functionality ensures that you can update bookings as needed while maintaining data integrity and financial accuracy.

## **Key Benefits of Editing a Rental Booking**

- **Flexible scheduling:** Admins can set custom start/end when needed, even if public time pickers are disabled.

- **Conflict prevention:** Buffers & inventory are always enforced so edits can’t create overlaps.

- **Deposit control:** Support Collect Upfront or Card on File deposits and charge/refund as needed.

- **Multi‑Listing Accuracy:** Edit one listing in a multi‑listing booking without disrupting the others.

- **Immediate visibility:** See results instantly in Appointments List View and Calendar View after you save.

```

* * *

## **Payment Summary**

The **Payment Summary** provides an overview of the financial state of the booking. It shows totals, collected payments, outstanding balances, and how deposits are handled.

**Displayed details:**

- **Subtotal** – The combined value of all listings.





  - Incase **Security Deposit** is enabled and set to **Collect Upfront,** it is included as a part of Subtotal.
- **Security Deposit Charged** – This appears incase Security Deposits are enabled and set to Card on File after manually charging a deposit. It conveys the security deposit that has been charged for the booking.

- **Paid** – Total amount collected so far.

- **Total Due** – Remaining amount to be collected.


```
Security Deposit - Collect Upfront policy: The deposit is automatically included in the Subtotal.

Security Deposit - Card on File policy: The deposit appears in totals only after manually charging it.
```

This section helps track payment progress and outstanding balances at a glance.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056275835/original/Uw99zt6DZLzXtyx2RDYSbxDAVPafwxE70g.png?1760718450)

* * *

## **Invoices**

Invoices are automatically created for every booking and provide a clear, itemized record of charges, payments, and adjustments. They ensure both customers and admins have transparent financial documentation for each booking.

**How invoices work:**

- Each booking automatically generates its first invoice at the time of creation. Subsequent edits, payments, or charges may trigger additional invoices or reflect back in the same invoice.

- Every invoice reflects the listings and any security deposits linked to the booking.

- Paid invoices remain visible for reference but cannot be edited. New changes create new invoices rather than altering the original record.


**Example:** If a booking has been fully paid and you add a new listing or change pricing, a new invoice will automatically be generated to record these updates, preserving the integrity of the paid invoice.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056276562/original/VkpdeLMpQkfkjkG7VjiNrk-ktDGA4lWCmg.png?1760718892)

* * *

## **Transactions**

The **Transactions** section lists all monetary actions related to the booking. It provides transparency and traceability for every payment, deposit, and refund.

**Each transaction includes:**

- **Date and Time** – When the transaction occurred.

- **Amount** – The value charged, paid, or refunded.

- **Status** – Indicates whether the transaction succeeded, failed, or was refunded.


Refunds must be processed manually via **Payments ->** **Transactions** and will reflect here once recorded. Transaction records ensure complete visibility into all financial movements related to the booking.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056276694/original/AOuN05Qkv_WBQ2cSFBPA0ZI1ZcHKaEl-tA.png?1760718949)

* * *

Admins can use action buttons to update booking statuses and manage payments directly from the Edit Booking page.

#### **Status Actions**

- **Mark as Confirmed** – Appears only when the booking is **Unconfirmed**. Sets all listings to **Booked**.

- **Mark as Booked / Active / Complete** – Opens a modal where you can select which listings to update.

  - **Revert to Unconfirmed** – Sets the entire booking (and all listings) to Unconfirmed.

  - **Cancel Booking** – Cancels the booking and all listings under it.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056276079/original/3p8WJlJBGydIREI8j5zJCtBL0aN-1A6pxw.png?1760718654)

#### **Payment Actions**

- **Collect Payment** – Opens a payment modal to collect payments online or record manual payments.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056276010/original/9lGvKDOyJ-8-JLVAZikhspv1dMC5AvY06A.png?1760718585)

* * *

## **Managing Statuses**

Statuses represent where a booking or listing stands in the rental process.

#### **Listing-Level Statuses**

Each listing must be updated manually as it progresses.

- **Unconfirmed** – Indicates the booking was created but not confirmed.

- **Booked** – Confirmed and ready to begin.

- **Active** – Currently ongoing.

- **Completed** – Successfully finished.

- **Canceled** – Automatically set when the booking is canceled.


#### **Booking-Level Statuses**

The booking-level status is determined automatically based on listing statuses.

| Listing Combination | Booking Status |
| --- | --- |
| All Unconfirmed | Unconfirmed |
| All Booked | Booked |
| All Active | Active |
| All Completed | Completed |
| Mixed (e.g., Booked + Active) | Partial |
| All Canceled | Canceled |

```
Note: Clicking Cancel Booking immediately changes both the booking and all listings to Canceled.
```

* * *

## **Saving Changes**

When you’ve finished editing:

1. Review all updates and financial details.

2. Click **Save Changes** (top-right corner).

3. The system updates all data in **Appointments View** and **Calendar View** instantly.


```
Tip: Always review Payment Summary and Invoice totals before saving to ensure accuracy.
```

* * *

## **Key Behaviors**

This section highlights important system behaviors to keep in mind when managing booking payments, edits, and refunds.

- **Editing after partial or full payment:** If a booking is partially paid, you can make edits as long as the updated total remains greater than or equal to the amount already paid. When a booking is fully paid, any further change creates a new invoice instead of modifying the existing one.

- **Invoice locking:** Once an invoice is marked as **Paid**, it becomes locked and cannot be edited to preserve historical accuracy.

- **Refund handling:** Refunds are processed manually from the **Transactions** section. While these do not automatically update invoices or the payment summary, the related transaction entry will show the updated status — **Refunded** or **Partially Refunded.**

- **Maintaining positive balances:** Totals are always maintained as positive values to ensure accurate accounting and prevent inconsistencies.


These behaviors ensure transparency, traceability, and consistency in booking financial management.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I modify a paid invoice?**

Once an invoice is marked as Paid, it becomes locked. You can still add new items or make changes, but the system creates a new invoice to reflect them.

**Q: What happens if I edit a partially paid booking?**

You can edit a partially paid booking, provided the new total remains equal to or higher than the amount already paid. The changes reflect back in the latest invoice.

**Q: How do refunds affect the booking?**

Refunds are processed manually from the Transactions section. They won’t change the invoice or payment summary totals, but the transaction will update to show **Refunded** or **Partially Refunded.**

**Q: What happens when I add new items after a booking is paid in full?**

A new invoice is generated automatically to record the new charges, while the previous paid invoice remains unchanged.

**Q: Can totals ever go below zero?**

No, totals are always kept positive to maintain accurate and traceable financial records.
