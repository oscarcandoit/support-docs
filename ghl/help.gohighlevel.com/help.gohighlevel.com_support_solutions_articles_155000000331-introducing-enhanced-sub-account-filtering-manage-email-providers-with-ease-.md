# Introducing Enhanced Sub-Account Filtering: Manage Email Providers with Ease!

Modified on: Sun, 21 Sep, 2025 at 11:21 AM

We're excited to announce an enhanced feature that enables agency users to filter sub-accounts based on their email provider.

Currently supported providers include LeadConnector, Mailgun, and others (excluding LC and Mailgun, such as Gmail and SMTP).

**Filtering Sub-Accounts:**

Now, users have the ability to filter sub-accounts based on three key criteria:

- **Provider**: Easily filter sub-accounts by specifying the provider they belong to.
- **Domain**: Filter sub-accounts by their associated domain name.
- **Email Verification**: Filter sub-accounts based on their email verification status, whether it’s enabled or not.


**Different Providers:**

We’ve organized the filtering process for two main providers, LC and Mailgun, and Others.

**LC**:

- Filter sub-accounts specifically under LC.
- Change the domain for selected sub-accounts.
- Enable or disable email verification as needed.

**Mailgun**:

- Filter sub-accounts under Mailgun.
- Switch the provider to LC for selected sub-accounts.
- Modify the Mailgun domain for the chosen sub-accounts.

**Others**:

- For sub-accounts not falling under LC or Mailgun, filter them by selecting “Others.”
- Change the provider to LC for these sub-accounts.


This feature provides more flexibility and customization options for managing sub-accounts email services efficiently.
