## **Conversation AI Modes and Settings**

The Conversation AI bot has 3 modes for your sub-account:

1. **OFF:** This is the default mode where the conversation AI feature is inactive. Bot training and bot trial are still active to train and test the bot before launching the bot

2. **Suggestive:** The bot responses are available inside the message composer box for the sub-account user to send as is or edit before sending.

3. **Auto-Pilot:** The bot automatically responds to a contact on behalf of the business.

* * *

## **Supported conversation channels**

The bot currently supports the following channels:

1. SMS

2. FB

3. IG

4. Web Chat (SMS Chat)

5. Live Chat


You can select which channels you'd like the bot to communicate through by going to "Settings" > "Conversation AI" and adding the channels via the "Supported Channels" dropdown.

## [**Training the Bot**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000996)

There are 2 ways to train your bot in the "Bot Training" section of the Conversation AI settings page in your sub-account settings:

1. [Through web URLs and public links](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001338)

2. Adding Question and Answer pairs

```
Note: Bot training is free of cost
```

* * *

## **Configuring Bot's Intent**

Currently, there are 2 intents supported by the bot:

1. **General Support or Q/A:** Provides information to the contact's queries based on the training information

2. **Appointment Booking:** Ask a few questions (customizable) and then book an appointment on the calendar.

Note: If an appointment for a contact is already booked ie in the Active/Confirmer state, the intent will dynamically switch to General support for that contact till the appointment is either completed or cancelled

* * *

## **Testing the Bot (Bot Trial)**

- The Conversation AI bot is FREE to test in the "Bot Trial" tab of your Conversation AI Sub-account settings page.

- The intent to test can be selected from the dropdown and the bot will respond to you the same way it will respond to a contact

- Feedback can be provided by using the "Thumbs Up and Down" under each bot's response to fine-tune and add FaQs to be trained

* * *

## **Workflow X Conversation AI**

Utilize the power of your bot training within workflows by using the Conversation AI Action following:

1. Customization your entire prompt

2. Conditional movement of the contact within the workflow

3. Ask specific questions and create branches based on the contact's reply

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I control how many messages the bot sends before it stops or hands off to an agent?**

Yes. In the Advanced Settings section, you can define the maximum message count before the bot stops responding or transfers the conversation to a human agent.

**Q: Can I turn on the AI for just one channel while turning it off for the others?**

Yes. GoHighLevel supports channel-specific bot control. You can assign or disable the bot per communication channel from within each channel’s settings or in the multi-bot view.

**Q: How do I add the AI chatbot to my website?**

Once you’ve built your Conversation AI Bot and added “Web Chat” as a supported channel, the AI functionality will automatically be included when you install the chat widget on your HighLevel funnel/website.
