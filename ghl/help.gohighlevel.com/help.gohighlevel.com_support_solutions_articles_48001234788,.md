## **What is the Content AI Guided Content Questions Feature?**

The Content AI Guided Content Questions feature in Social Planner introduces an adaptive content generation experience. When creating a new post with Content AI, the form now dynamically adjusts its questions based on your selected social platform (like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn) and content type (such as Post or Reel). This ensures you only answer the most relevant questions, making it easier to produce targeted, on-brand content for each channel.

## **Key Benefits of Content AI Guided Content Questions**

- **Platform-Specific Guidance:** Only see questions that matter for your chosen platform and content type, reducing clutter and confusion.

- **Brand Voice Consistency:** Brand Voice fields are auto-filled to keep your messaging on-brand, but you can still customize as needed.

- **Streamlined Workflow:** Mandatory fields are always visible, while optional questions are tucked away in a collapsible menu for a cleaner interface.

- **Clearer Content Goals:** Guided questions help you define your message, content goal, and call-to-action (CTA) for each post.

- **Improved Engagement:** Posts are more relevant and tailored, leading to better audience interaction and less manual editing.

- **Time Savings:** Spend less time tweaking AI-generated content and more time engaging with your audience.
