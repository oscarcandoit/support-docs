## **Key features & benefits:**

- Users now have the flexibility to select the font weight for any given component within their website or funnel.
- The font-weight option is available across a wide range of components, including text components, buttons, category navigation, FAQs, countdown components, navigation menus, store components, and image feature components.
- You can choose to show different font weight for mobile and desktop view
- Font size slider sensitivity reduce to 100 for better UX

## **How to use ?**

- Navigate to the page builder interface.
- Select any component from the list mentioned above.
- Below the font size settings, you’ll find a new dropdown option for font weight.
- Choose your desired font weight. You can also customize different font weights for mobile and desktop versions.
- Save or publish your changes to see the updated font weight reflected on your website or funnel.

## **Note:**

- Not all font family support all the font weight which means select font weight might not have any effect on text style if family doesn’t support the given font weight.
- Font weight option will not apply if you have bold the text using text editor. Text editor bold option will take priority over font weight option.

## **How it looks?**
