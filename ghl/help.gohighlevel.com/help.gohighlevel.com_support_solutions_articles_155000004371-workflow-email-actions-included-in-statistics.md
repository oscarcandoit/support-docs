We’ve introduced a similar way to view for all your email campaign statistics—whether sent through workflows or email campaigns—for a more streamlined analysis.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

- [What's Improved:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004371-workflow-email-actions-included-in-statistics#What's-Improved%3A)
- [How to Use:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004371-workflow-email-actions-included-in-statistics#How-to-Use%3A)
- [Note:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004371-workflow-email-actions-included-in-statistics#Note%3A-)

## **What's Improved:**

- Workflow email stats now under Email Marketing.

- See overall and individual email action stats for a workflow.

- Edit workflows directly from the same screen.


## **How to Use:**

- Go to Email Marketing -> Campaigns -> Workflow Campaigns.

- Click Edit Workflow to access the builder.

- Click Statistics to view workflow stats.

- Use the dropdown to see stats for individual email actions.


## **Note:**

- The email action creation and syncing with templates/ creating new templates remains unchanged.
