# **What is Bluesky Integration?**

Bluesky Integration adds the fast-growing Bluesky network to Social Planner’s supported platforms. Authenticate your Bluesky handle using an app password, then create, schedule, and track Bluesky posts from the same calendar that already manages Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, TikTok, and more.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Bluesky Integration**

- **Zero context-switching:** Plan, draft, and publish Bluesky posts alongside your other channels in Social Planner.

- **Faster client approvals:** Route Bluesky posts through the same review/approval flow your team already uses, so nothing goes live without sign-off.

- **Fail-safe publishing:** Compose within Bluesky’s limits (300 characters, up to 4 images or one video) to avoid last-minute errors and failed posts.

- **Keep a steady cadence:** Batch and schedule posts for the week in minutes so Bluesky stays active even when your team is busy.

- **Fewer tools, lower cost:** Skip separate Bluesky schedulers—manage everything in HighLevel to save money and reduce admin overhead.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why do I need an app password instead of my Bluesky login?** For security. Bluesky requires third-party tools to use app passwords so your main credentials stay protected.

**Q: What if I lose the app password?**

Go to Bluesky, delete the old app password and create a new one, then reconnect in Social Planner.

**Q: What happens if my app password expires?**

Generate a new app password in Bluesky and reconnect the account in Social Planner.

**Q: Can I connect multiple Bluesky accounts/handles?**

Yes. Connect each account separately, each needs its own app password.

**Q: Do I need to reconnect after logging out of Bluesky?**

No. Once connected with an app password, your Bluesky account will stay connected until you remove it or reset the password.
