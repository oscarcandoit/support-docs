# **What is Time Slot Visibility in HighLevel?**

Time slot visibility refers to whether or not appointment booking slots appear to your clients on your public calendar. These slots are determined by a combination of factors—calendar settings, user availability, buffer times, external conflicts, and Round Robin logic. When something’s misconfigured, you may run into issues like:

- A user is available but their time slots are missing

- Time ranges are open but not bookable

- The calendar shows more (or fewer) times than expected


Understanding how these variables interact is essential to diagnosing the issue.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Understanding Time Slot Visibility**

Knowing how calendar logic works helps you reduce missed bookings, improve user experience, and troubleshoot faster.

- Identify configuration issues faster

- Avoid overlapping or conflicting calendar events

- Optimize team availability with correct Round Robin settings

- Use the built-in Troubleshooting Tool for deeper insights

- Minimize client friction during booking


* * *

## **How to Troubleshoot Missing or Unexpected Time Slots**

Time slot issues can result from multiple overlapping factors. Use the grouped checklist below to methodically diagnose and correct visibility problems.

## **Calendar Settings**

Calendar configurations are the foundation of availability logic. Incorrect selections here are a common cause of visibility issues.

### **Check that you're viewing the correct calendar.**

Go to **Calendars > Calendar Settings**. Click **Edit** on desired calendar. Confirm you are working inside the intended calendar by checking calendar name, calendar group and calendar type.

### **Verify working hours and custom date availability**

Click **Edit** on the desired calendar. Visit the calendar's **Availability** tab and confirm that:

- Weekly hours are properly set.

- Date-specific overrides haven’t blocked times. Learn more about availability settings.

### **Confirm the correct user(s) or team is assigned**

Availability is based on the assigned users. Check under Team Members Assigned by clicking edit on desired calendar then using the dropdown named **Select** **Te** **am Member & Assign Meeting Location** in the Service Details tab.

* * *

## **Slot Duration, Buffers & Interval Settings**

How your slots are spaced—and buffered—can create gaps or block slots entirely.

### **Check your slot interval, duration and buffer settings.**

These control how often time slots appear and how long they are. To edit, Go to **Settings** → **Calendars**. Click on the calendar you want to edit. In the calendar editor, navigate to the **A** **vailability** tab. Scroll to the **Slot Duration, Post Buffer Time** and **Slot Interval** fields and adjust the values to match your service needs.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045405376/original/TWzMT4XREii7qQZxOktc_FK_YS-60ACebg.png?1745261927)

## **External Conflicts & Calendar Sync**

Connected calendars can block availability based on busy times. Check for events blocking slots in synced Google/Outlook calendars.

External calendar events—if marked busy—will block slots on the internal calendar. [Learn more on how conflicts work](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002374)

* * *

## **Timezones**

Timezone mismatches are a hidden but common issue, especially across teams or international clients.

### **Make sure all timezones align**

Double-check both your user profile settings and the client’s calendar view to make sure A 3 PM slot for one user could be 10 AM for another.

* * *

## **Use the Calendar Troubleshooting Tool**

### **Use the Troubleshooting Tool to understand slot logic**

This built-in feature breaks down exactly why a time slot is blocked. To access the tool, Navigate to Calendar Settings, locate the calendar you want to troubleshoot, and select Troubleshoot Calendar (Wrench Icon). [Learn More on how to use the Calendar Troubleshooting Tool](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003358)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why does a team member show available but isn’t getting booked?**

The Round Robin logic may be skipping them due to prior assignments or availability priority settings.

**Q: Why are my booking slots not aligning with my working hours?**

This could be due to slot intervals, buffer times, or hidden external calendar conflicts.

**Q: Why do slots show up on some browsers but not others?**

Browser caching or mismatched timezone display can cause these inconsistencies.

**Q: Can I allow clients to pick their preferred team member?**

Yes, enable **staff selection** under the calendar’s settings if you're using Round Robin.

**Q: What does the troubleshooting tool show me?**

It lists every rule or condition blocking a specific slot, including time zone, buffer, user assignment, and more.
