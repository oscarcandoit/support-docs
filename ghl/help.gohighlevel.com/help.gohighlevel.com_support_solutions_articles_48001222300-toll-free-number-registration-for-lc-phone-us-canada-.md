# Toll-Free Number Verification Guide for LC - Phone (US/Canada)

Modified on: Mon, 23 Jun, 2025 at 3:03 AM

To improve trust and message deliverability, all toll-free numbers used for texting in the US and Canada **must be verified** before sending SMS/MMS messages. Starting **November 8, 2023**, unverified numbers will be subject to filtering and may be blocked entirely. This guide walks you through the **toll-free number verification process within LeadConnector (LC Phone)**, including requirements, submission steps, and how to avoid rejections.

```
Note: Starting Jan 31, 2024, messages sent from Toll-Free phone numbers with Pending Verifications will be blocked and will be subject to messaging fees.

-> Any blocked messages will return Error 30032 or Error 30007.
-> This is only valid for the US and Canada Toll Free Numbers.
-> This is only required for messaging and does not have any impacts on calling.

# **What is Toll-Free Number Verification?**

Toll-free numbers (e.g., starting with 800, 888, 877, etc.) are commonly used by businesses to send and receive messages. Verification is the process of **registering your toll-free number and business use case with carriers** to ensure you are a legitimate sender. This prevents spam and enables consistent delivery of your messages.

Verification is **required for sending messages from Toll-Free phone numbers to the US and Canada**. Users who don't verify will be **blocked from sending any messages** from the beginning on November 8, 2023. We recommend all users submit their registration as soon as possible to avoid delays in processing, and verification.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Toll-Free Verification**

✅ Higher message deliverability

✅ Compliance with carrier rules

✅ Reduced risk of message filtering or blocking

✅ Improved customer trust and brand reputation

* * *

## **Requirements Before You Begin**

Before submitting the verification form, you’ll need:

- Legal business name

- Business website (or social media link if no website)

- Business address

- Detailed use case description (what types of messages will be sent)

- At least 2 sample message templates

- Opt-in method used to collect recipient permission (e.g., form, text keyword, verbal, etc.)

**Use this** [A2P Opt-In Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001426) to write compliant opt-in language.

## **Opt-In Methods**

### **1\. Verbal Opt-In**

Below is an example of a verbal opt-in, which would happen during a phone call with the consumer. You can also get a verbal opt-in by using a phone IVR flow, which would consist of an automated system getting opt-in confirmation from the consumer.

- **Phone IVR:** "As part of our service we can send you automated monthly text alerts regarding account payment activity. We will send two messages per month. Message and data rates may apply, depending on your mobile phone service plan. At any time you can get more help by replying HELP to these texts, or you can opt-out completely by replying STOP. Mobile Terms of Service are available at http://ghl.com/terms and our Privacy Statement can be found at https://ghl.com/privacy. Please reply with 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you would like this service".



**Customer:** "Yes please"



**Phone IVR:** "Great! We will send you a text message to confirm your enrollment here shortly."

### **2\. Web Form Opt-In**

An embedded form on the end business’s website prompts end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.

#### **⚠️ Important Requirements for Web Form Opt-In:**

1. Opt-in checkbox **MUST** be selectable by end-user

2. Opt-in checkbox **MUST** include a disclaimer (consent message) such as:
   - _"I consent to receive sms notifications, alert from COMPANY NAME HERE. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP to (XXX) XXX-XXX for assistance. You can reply STOP to unsubscribe at any time."_
3. Opt-in consent message and checkbox **MUST** be separated from **Privacy Policy \| Terms of Service** and **Promotional** consent checkboxes. Promotional consent may be something like the following:
   - _"By checking this box I agree to receive occasional marketing messages from INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE."_
4. Opt-in disclaimer **MUST** have All CTA disclosures present to be considered compliant:




   - Program name and/or a description of the messages that will be sent (appointment reminders, marketing messages, occasional offers, etc.)

   - Organization or individual being represented in the initial message

   - Fee disclosure (“Message and data rates may apply”)

   - Service delivery frequency or recurring messages disclosure (“4 messages per month”, “Message frequency varies”, “1 message per login”, etc

   - Customer care information (typically “Text HELP for help” or Help at XXX-XXX-XXXX) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)

   - Opt out instructions (typically “Text STOP to unsubscribe”) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)

   - Link to Privacy Policy describing how end user opt-in information will be used. Be sure there is no mention of sharing of personal information with Third Parties (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)

   - Link to Terms and Conditions describing terms of service (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)

   - Incorporate a checkbox option that end-users must select in order to receive SMS messaging. **The checkbox can not be pre-selected.** The checkbox provides the end-user the ability to agree, or not agree, to receive SMS messaging.

**Below are examples of Web form Opt-In flow.**

When **Phone Number** field is **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

- Consent checkboxes should be separated for both Marketing and Non-Marketing Messages.
- Consent **checkboxes cannot be pre-selected** and **should be optional** when **Phone Number is required.**
- SMS notifications cannot be forced in the form. Meaning **you cannot require BOTH consent and the phone number to proceed.**
- **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047335618/original/5kprFJidPYVswryBqLoLLfpEBx5jpQUcgg.png?1748418112)

When **Phone Number** field not **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

- Consent cheekbones not required when Phone Number field is not mandatory.
- **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047335623/original/Yzm7MV0JjtnvWLOSeYUZZKv5tzBaR-s6Mw.png?1748418113)

```
PLEASE NOTE:

If the web opt-in is behind a login or not yet published, host a screen shot on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the image URL and the website URL in your registration form where it asks: "How do end-users consent to receive messages?"

To get a useable image link, you can upload the screenshot to your Media Storage Library in your HighLevel sub-account as shown in the screenshot below:
```

### **3\. Paper Form Opt-In**

An in-store visitor completes a physical form that collects their phone number and their consent to subscribe to your texting campaign.

Host a screenshot of the paper form on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?".

### **4\. Text Message Opt-In**

Host a screen shot of the campaign collateral on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?" along with the website URL.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047335620/original/kY_utVS0jQMyLz0y9xMeBFsqZTe-08JusA.png?1748418112)

### **5\. Mobile QR Code Opt-In**

You can also use a QR code that links to an online form prompting end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.

QR codes can direct the consumer to the messaging application used on their mobile device (for example iMessage) with a templated opt-in message, or can even take the consumer directly to a web-form opt-in on your website.

```
PLEASE NOTE: If the QR code leads to a Web-Form Opt-In, please follow all requirements listed in this article above where we discuss the Web-Form Opt-In method.
```

|
|

```
Note: The opt-in method must match the submitted Use Case. For example, marketing campaigns require express consent where the user actively agrees to receive messages.

Live Website Required:

✅ Must be operational and include a clear opt-in for messaging.

✅ Include Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links in the footer of all pages.
```

- #### Choose **Use Case Category/Categories** that your business will message users for.      - Choose the category that best represents **how the number will be used**.    - Must reflect the **actual messaging pattern** tied to this toll-free number.            **Note**: Ensure that the 'Marketing' checkbox is selected along with any other applicable use cases if marketing activities are involved. If 'Marketing' is not selected in the opt-in form or the use case does not reflect marketing, verification may fail.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048688917/original/Dh--Cn35xXFZ6LevYF7ZwK_3-TfyeR90Jw.png?1750665225)

- #### Enter **Opt-In Workflow Image URLs**.      - Clearly outline **how the user gives consent** (Opt-In Type).    - A **visual proof** (image, screenshot, or document) that matches the **selected Opt-In Type**.               - The visual must clearly show **where and how** the user provides their phone number and agrees to receive messages.        - The URL or file must be **publicly accessible** (not behind a login or private folder) - **Approved Examples:**            [https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/RNTEDRA9ap9xSh2MyTYS/media/65271336fe7786badd88b169.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/RNTEDRA9ap9xSh2MyTYS/media/65271336fe7786badd88b169.png)

- #### Add **Use Case Descriptions**.      - Provide a **detailed explanation** of how messaging is used.    - The more specific, the better — include:                  - Purpose of messaging        - Target audience        - Opt-in methods        - Platforms used (POS, web forms, chat, etc.)        - ✅ **Approved Example:**                    "This number is used to send promotional offers to customers of John’s Coffee Shop who have opted in through our website or POS system."        - ❌ **Rejected Example:**                    "Marketing" – too vague and not tied to specific content or opt-in method.

- #### Add **Message Content**.      - Provide sample messages that match the use case. Must include:                  - A clear message        - Personalization (if applicable)        - Business name        - Opt-out language ("Reply STOP to opt out")        - ✅ **Approved Example:**                    "Thank you for being a loyal customer of John’s Coffee Shop. Enjoy 10% off your next purchase. Reply STOP to opt out."        - ❌ **Rejected Example:**                    "Your appointment is today at 10:00 AM" – lacks business name, opt-out language, and context.

- #### Check the **I agree to the Terms of Service** box.

- #### Click on **Send Information for Verification** button.    ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046281345/original/eiS5vEPfdMRq19OZh7YuWJF5Gu6Ew8Rlew.gif?1746648641)


#### **Note**- _Additionally if user hasn't completed the KYC verification yet, they will need to do so after submission of all     the above details._

_The verification experience looks like this_:

**Highlights of Recent Changes****:**

- **Simplified Verification:** Users can now complete toll-free number verification without needing a business tax ID.

- **Lowered Barriers:** The new verification flow reduces entry barriers for all users especially sole proprietors.

- **Selective KYC Implementation:** The platform implements Know Your Customer (KYC) verification to ensure platform security while minimizing the burden on legitimate users.

## **Monitor Verification Status**

Phone Number registrations can take up to **4 to 6 weeks to complete.** However, we have seen Toll-Free Numbers approval in as little as two days (though we cannot guarantee any timeline for approval).

Once you submit your verification request, you can monitor the verification status as it changes during processing through the Console. Please see below for a full overview of each status:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ****TFPN Traffic**** | ****Traffic limits**** | ****What's happening?**** |
| **Restricted (Un-verified)** | **Blocked** | **Starting on November 8, 2023, ALL Restricted traffic will be blocked in the US. To avoid this, we recommend submitting your number(s) for verification as soon as possible.**<br>**Restricted (previously “Unverified”) status means that your Toll-Free number has not been submitted for verification or was not approved.** |
| **Verified (Approved)** | **3 SMS segments per second** | **Upon a successful review of your verification submission and carrier approval, your number(s) will be moved to "Verified" status. Verified numbers have full access to A2P sending, and a greatly reduced risk for message filtering on Toll-Free traffic toward all major networks in the US and Canada, as long as you adhere to your stated use case and all applicable rules, such as Twilio's Messaging Policy.** |
| **Rejected** | **Blocked** | **A rejected verification request can occur for a number of reasons and can affect your ability to send messaging traffic.** |
