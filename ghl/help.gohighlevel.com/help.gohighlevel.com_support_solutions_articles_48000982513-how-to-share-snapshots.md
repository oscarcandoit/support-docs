# How to Share Snapshots

Modified on: Fri, 3 May, 2024 at 11:41 PM

Snapshots can be shared to new and existing sub-accounts. By doing so, you can easily create a copy of a particular sub-account at a specific point in time, including pre-configured assets like funnels, websites, forms, workflows, calendars, custom fields and values, and much more.

We'll cover how to share a snapshot with another sub-account and how to use them with SaaS mode so new sub-accounts will be created with the snapshot you define instantly.

# **Share Options**

## Agencies on $97 & $297 Plans

### 1\. Get a share link

- This creates a shareable link you can copy/paste and send to someone.
- It can only be used once, meaning that if someone uses it to import the Snapshot into an agency account (including yours), it won't work again, and another shareable link must be generated.


### 2\. Email share link

- Sends a share link via email to whatever email address(es) are put in the Emails field. The email sent also contains a clickable link that can be used to import the Snapshot straight from the email.


### 3\. Get a permanent link

- This creates a shareable link you can copy/paste and send to someone.
- Unlike the share link (1. above), this link can be used infinite times.

## Agencies on $497 Plan (SaaS)

All share options above will be included, plus:

### 3\. Agency Restricted

- By utilizing Agency Restricted Share Links, you can confidently and securely share Snapshots with your chosen trusted agencies. Simply as the other agencies provide their unique relationship numbers and a secure link will be instantly generated for their exclusive use.


### 4\. Sub-account Restricted

- Sub-account Restricted Share Links let you share Snapshots for specific sub-accounts only, making your data sharing more personalized, and only those sub-accounts can use that snapshot.

# **FAQs**

### **If I share a snapshot with agencies outside of my own and later make updates to it, will those changes be reflected or automatically updated in the snapshot previously shared with other agencies**?

No, regardless of your share options (1-4), snapshots are always considered clones of a specific sub-account at a specific moment. Therefore, any updates made to a snapshot will not be automatically reflected in previously shared snapshots.

### **How can I update a snapshot for sub-accounts within my agency?**

To update a snapshot for sub-accounts within your agency, you need to follow these steps:

- First, update the Snapshot with the desired changes.
- Next, push the updated Snapshot to the linked sub-accounts within your agency.

### **How should I update a shared snapshot using share options 1, 2, and 3 from above to agencies outside of mine?**

If you have shared a snapshot using share options 1, 2, or 3, and you want to update it, follow these steps:

- Refresh or update the existing snapshot with the desired changes.
- Re-share the NEW snapshot URL with the agencies involved.

It's important to note that generating a new Snapshot URL will invalidate the previous one. Therefore, ensure that you share the new URL for the updated snapshot.

### **How can I share an updated snapshot with agencies using 'Sub-account' or 'Agency' restricted share links (Share options 3 & 4 from above)?**

To share a new snapshot with agencies using 'Sub-account' or 'Agency' restricted share links, follow these steps:

1. [Refresh or update](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982583) the current snapshot with the desired changes.
2. Go to the snapshot share modal and select the 'Sub-account' or 'Agency' restricted share link.
3. Enter all the **existing and new** 'sub-account' or 'Agency' relationship numbers.
4. Click on 'share' to generate a new snapshot URL.
5. Share this new URL with the agencies involved, as the old URL will no longer work.

### **I shared my snapshot and did not see the 'New' items. What happened?**

If you shared a snapshot and did not see the 'New' items, you may not have [updated](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982583) the existing snapshot before sharing it. Remember that snapshots are copies of a specific account at a specific point in time.

To include the 'New' items in the shared snapshot, you need to follow these steps:

- Update the existing snapshot to include the 'New' items.
- [Re-share the updated snapshot](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001185085) or [push the update](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982583) to the relevant sub-accounts
