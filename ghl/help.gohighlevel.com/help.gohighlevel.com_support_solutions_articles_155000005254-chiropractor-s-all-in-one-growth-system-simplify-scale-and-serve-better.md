# Chiropractor's All-in-One Growth System: Simplify, Scale, and Serve Better

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 4:16 AM

Running a chiropractic clinic is no small feat. Between patient care, last-minute cancellations, managing staff, chasing down missed calls, and trying to grow your business — it’s a nonstop balancing act. And let’s face it: most days feel like you’re putting out fires instead of building a streamlined, profitable operation.

But what if your clinic ran on a system that actually worked for you — automating the busywork, organizing your leads, and making sure no opportunity slips through the cracks? That’s exactly what GoHighLevel (GHL) helps you do.

This playbook is your step-by-step guide to getting your foundation in place — from CRM setup and appointment scheduling to your Google Business profile and essential integrations.

### **What You Need on Day 1**

#### **1\. Set Up Your CRM & Patient Pipeline**

Think of your CRM as your digital filing cabinet — but smarter. Instead of digging through paper files or spreadsheets, everything lives in one place and updates automatically.

- Upload all your existing patients and leads into GHL.

- Use smart tags like "New Lead," "Consult Scheduled," "Active Patient," or "Inactive 30 Days" to keep your database organized.

- Set up a clear patient pipeline: New Lead → Consult Booked → Active Care Plan → No-Show/Follow-Up → Reactivated.


> **Pro Tip: You can manually add contacts, import a spreadsheet, or let GHL do the heavy lifting through your intake forms and lead capture funnels.**

**[How to create new contacts](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005055-getting-started-create-new-contact)**

* * *

#### **2\. Activate Your Online Booking Calendar**

Today’s patients don’t want to call. They want to book online in seconds.

- Set up a calendar inside GHL so patients can schedule appointments directly.

- Add buffer times, smart availability, auto-confirmation emails, and reminders.

- Link this calendar on your website, Google profile, and social media.


> **Use multiple calendars if you offer different types of appointments — New Patient Consults, Adjustments, Follow-ups, etc.**

**[How to Set Up a Personal Booking Calendar with HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005153-how-to-set-up-a-personal-booking-calendar-with-highlevel)**

* * *

#### **3\. Launch Basic Patient Automations**

Even with the best intentions, follow-ups fall through the cracks when things get busy. Automations ensure no one gets forgotten.

Start with these three workflows:

- SMS and email confirmation when a patient books

- A friendly reminder 24 hours before their appointment

- A thank-you message with a review request after their visit


> **Practices that use reminders reduce no-shows by over 30%.**

**[How to set up Automations](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002445-introduction-to-workflows-and-automations)**

* * *

#### **4\. Set Up and Optimize Your Google Business Profile**

Your Google Business Profile is your clinic’s digital storefront. It’s how most new patients find you — often before they even click your website.

- Make sure your address, phone number, clinic hours, and website are accurate.

- Add photos of your space, staff, and happy patients.

- Include your GHL booking link right in the profile.

- Turn on messaging so patients can text you straight from search results.


> **92% of patients trust online reviews as much as word-of-mouth. A complete and active Google profile helps you rank higher and convert more searchers into bookings.**

* * *

#### **5\. Turn On Missed Call Text Back**

When a patient or lead calls and no one answers — you risk losing them forever. This single feature fixes that.

- Enable a missed-call text back so every time you miss a call, GHL automatically sends a message like:

"Hey! Sorry we missed your call. This is \[Your Clinic Name\]. How can we help?"

- You can customize this for new leads, existing patients, or even route messages to your AI receptionist.

**[Call Connect & Missed Call Text-Back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001197248-call-connect-missed-call-text-back)**


* * *

#### **6\. Finalize Your Location Settings in GHL**

Your setup isn’t complete without tightening your back-end settings. These may seem small, but they power your system behind the scenes.

- Set up your business name, contact details, time zone, and clinic logo under **Business Profile**

- Connect your **Google My Business**, **Facebook**, and **Instagram** accounts so all leads and conversations live in one place

- Choose or customize your **pipeline stages** to reflect your clinic’s flow

- Configure default calendars, notifications, and lead sources

- Set your user permissions if you have team members managing bookings or follow-ups


> This setup is the “plumbing” that allows everything else to flow smoothly. Skipping it will create chaos later.

* * *

### **Your Starting Checklist**

| Task | Time to Set Up | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import Contacts | 10 mins | Build your CRM instantly |
| Connect Google Calendar | 5 mins | Enable online bookings |
| Launch Automations | 15 mins | Stop no-shows & ghosted leads |
| Set Up Google Business | 20 mins | Show up in search + reviews |
| Enable Missed Call Text Back | 3 mins | Save every opportunity |
| Complete Business Profile + Integrations | 10 mins | Full sync across systems |

* * *

### **Outcome: Less Admin, More Booked Appointments**

Once you’ve set this up, here’s what changes in your day-to-day:

- Your front desk isn’t glued to the phone — patients are booking themselves.

- You stop worrying about missed follow-ups or forgotten leads.

- Every contact lives in one system — not in 3 different tools or sticky notes.

- You start getting more reviews, more referrals, and more walk-ins from Google.


In short? You’re not just hoping things work — you’ve got a system that makes them work.
