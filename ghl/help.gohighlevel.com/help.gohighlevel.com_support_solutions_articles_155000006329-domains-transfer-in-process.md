# **What is Domain Transfer-In**

**Domain Transfer-In** is a built-in HighLevel feature that allows users to move domain ownership and management from third-party registrars (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) into the HighLevel platform. This simplifies your workflow by letting you purchase, transfer, renew, and manage DNS records from within your location. The Domains page acts as your centralized dashboard for all domain activity, improving visibility and control.

When you initiate a domain transfer-in, HighLevel guides you through a 5-step process—starting with domain entry and ending with approval from your current registrar. The system automatically checks transfer eligibility, allows DNS record import or review, and ensures a secure finalization using an EPP (authorization) code. Once complete, the transferred domain integrates instantly with your websites, funnels, client portals, and email systems—all within HighLevel.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Domain Transfer‑In**

- **Centralized control**: Manage domains, DNS, billing, and renewals alongside websites, funnels, and email tools in HighLevel.

- **Security & flexibility**: Full DNS access within HighLevel—no external registrar logins needed.

- **No lost term**: Existing remaining term carries over, and +1 year is added at transfer (TLD exceptions may apply).

- **Transparent pricing**: Fixed, upfront transfer fees for clarity.

- **Smooth integrations**: Instantly connect transferred domains to HighLevel products.


* * *

## **Setup & Prerequisites**

Before you start, confirm that your domain meets industry requirements and is ready for domain transfer:

- Domain is older than 60 days (ICANN rule).

- Domain is unlocked at your current registrar.

- WHOIS privacy protection is turned off.

- DNSSEC (if enabled) is disabled.

- You have access to the EPP/Auth code from your registrar.

- Your contact email is correct in WHOIS, since transfer approval emails will be sent there.

- Your HighLevel wallet has sufficient funds for the transfer.

- We recommend saving a copy of your current DNS settings.

* * *

![](https://jumpshare.com/share/rR6gVnjPlCmD6NTfM90h+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-04+at+11.36.44+PM.png)

4. To transfer a new domain, click the **Transfer-In Domain** button.



![](https://jumpshare.com/share/z5QtC2UCM12EBniFj93M+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-04+at+11.39.02+PM.png)

5. Or click on the **Purchase/Transfer Domain** button.



![](https://jumpshare.com/share/w2Irmx2mjhUBraqyhP33+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-04+at+11.43.20+PM.png)

6. **Enter the domain name you want to transfer** and click the **Continue** button.



![](https://jumpshare.com/share/yXwYA3HzoEGdHK4UsVI8+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-04+at+11.54.46+PM.png)


### **Step 2:** Eligibility Check

1. The system runs an eligibility check to confirm ICANN requirements. If the domain is eligible for transfer you can continue with the transfer process.

2. During the **Eligibility Check**, HighLevel verifies whether your domain qualifies to be transferred into the platform. The system evaluates both registrar-level rules and technical readiness. If the domain is eligible for transfer you can continue with the transfer process. When a domain is eligible for transfer you can see the




   - Domain Name
   - Current Domain Registrar
   - Current expiration and new expiration (extended by 1 year)
   - Applicable fee for the extension of expiry date.
3. Make sure you have access to your current registrar before proceeding.



![](https://jumpshare.com/share/KmTBlDnpyy5qXBjQZgqT+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-05+at+12.17.00+AM.png)

4. A domain is **not eligible for transfer when**:




   - Its current registrar is not supported.
   - It has been previously purchased internally.
   - It’s TLD is not supported.
   - It has been purchased or transferred in last 60 days
   - It has an EPP status that does not allow for transfers (eg, pendingDelete, redemptionPeriod, serverHold etc)
   - The transfer would result in the term of the domain exceeding the maximum allowed term
   - Domain extension is not supported.
5. In these cases, the **Continue button will be disabled**, and a relevant error message will **explain why the domain cannot be transferred at this time**.



![](https://jumpshare.com/share/khuuGlRfvHko96IAmf5C+/GIF+Recording+2025-11-05+at+12.22.21+AM.gif)


### **Step 3:** Review and Save DNS Records

```
Note: Before transferring your domain (e.g., from GoDaddy or Namecheap), review and replicate all DNS records from your current provider. This prevents downtime for your website, email, and other services.
```

Users can choose between two methods to retrieve your DNS records by:

```
Note: Your domain registrar and DNS provider can be different if you’ve changed the nameservers where you bought your domain. For example, if you bought your domain on GoDaddy but pointed it to Cloudflare by updating the nameservers, then Cloudflare is now managing your DNS. In that case, you’ll need to log in to Cloudflare to access your DNS records (zone file).
```

#### **1\. Upload DNS Zone File**

This method is recommended if you want to import all DNS records from your current DNS provider without missing any of the existing records. This file contains all your domain’s DNS entries including A, CNAME, TXT, MX, and other record types.

To get the DNS Zone file from your current DNS provider:

1. Login into your current DNS provider or where you purchased your domain originally.

2. Go to DNS settings of the domain you want to transfer

3. Locate the option to export DNS zone/records file

4. In case you can’t find such option, reach out to your current DNS provider or registrar’s support to get it.


#### ``` Note: Go to your registrar below to follow step by step process:  GoDaddy - Learn about how to upload zone files from GoDaddy HERE.  Cloudflare - Learn about how to upload zone files from Cloudflare HERE.  NameCheap - Currently, Namecheap does not offer a downloadable zone file, so you may need to recreate the records manually or reach out to support to access the records. Link to manually extract the records HERE.  IONOS-  Domain Exports , Cloud DNS , API How-Tos ```

![](https://jumpshare.com/share/BkYkQJsNCYsXzMyWBmcG+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-05+at+12.47.10+AM.png)

#### **2\. Auto Scan DNS Records**

```
Note: Your domain registrar and DNS provider can be different if you’ve updated the nameserver records at your registrar. For example, if you purchased your domain from GoDaddy but pointed it to Cloudflare by changing the nameservers, then Cloudflare becomes your DNS provider. In that case, you’ll need to log in to Cloudflare to view and compare your DNS records.
```

- This method is convenient and requires no prior setup. In this method, your existing DNS records will be automatically scanned, but some of the existing records may not get detected in the scan.

- So, to avoid interruptions in your existing connected services like funnel, website etc post transfer, it is highly recommended to manually cross check the scanned records with your records at your current DNS provider or registrar and add/edit records if required.

![](https://jumpshare.com/share/YptMRgalD0ehKRYsx5uJ+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-05+at+1.03.57+AM.png)

### **Reviewing DNS Records**

```
Note: Manually cross-check scanned DNS records against those at your DNS host/registrar. Missing entries can cause website or email outages after transfer—review and add any that weren’t captured.
```

1. Once records are retrieved, you can now review your DNS records. In the DNS table shown you can:




   - View all DNS entries in a table format, categorized by record type (e.g., A, CNAME, TXT, MX).

   - Add new records by clicking “Add Record”.

   - Edit or delete individual records as needed.

   - Search records using any field (name, type, value).
2. After reviewing, **check the Confirmation box** and click on **Continue**.

#### **![](https://jumpshare.com/share/2XiGPMncxy9qNxlzYQZd+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-05+at+1.21.38+AM.png)**

### **Step 4:** Finalize Transfer

The Finalize Transfer step is where you complete the authorization process to move your domain from your current registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, IONOS, etc.) to HighLevel. This step ensures that your domain and related services continue working smoothly after the transfer.

On the Finalize Transfer screen, you will:

1. **Log into your current registrar**(where you originally registered the domain)

2. **Disable DNSSEC & Whois Privacy**




1. Before initiating a domain transfer, it is important to disable DNSSEC and remove Whois privacy protection from your current registrar. General Instructions (the details can vary):




      1. Log in to your current registrar account.
      2. Go to DNS or Domain Settings.
      3. Find the option for DNSSEC and disable it.
      4. If Whois Privacy Protection is enabled, turn it off.
      5. Save changes
2. **GoDaddy**: [Disabling DNSSEC](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in/help/turn-dnssec-on-or-off-6420) and [Removing Whois Privacy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in/help/change-my-domain-privacy-level-32283) Note: It may take a few minutes for the DNSSEC record to be fully removed. You’ll see a confirmation on GoDaddy once the setting is updated.

3. **NameCheap**: [Disabling DNSSEC](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/subcategory/2232/dnssec/) and [Removing Whois Privacy](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/484/37/how-do-i-disable-domain-privacy-service-for-my-domain/)

4. **IONOS**: [Disabling DNSSEC](https://www.ionos.com/help/domains/dns-pro/setting-up-and-managing-dnssec/#c165924) and [Removing Whois Privacy](https://www.ionos.com/help/domains/domain-guard/disabling-domain-guard/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20deactivate%20Domain,instructions%20contained%20in%20the%20email.)
3. **Unlock your domain and request authorization code (EPP code)**


1. Before transferring your domain, it must be unlocked, and you’ll need an authorization code (also called an EPP or transfer code) from your current registrar. General Instructions (the details can vary):




      1. Log in to your current registrar account (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, IONOS).

      2. Go to your domain management or domain settings section.

      3. Look for the Domain Lock or Registrar Lock option.

      4. Disable or turn off the lock to unlock the domain.

      5. Once unlocked, locate the option to get the authorization code (may be labeled EPP code, Transfer Code, or AuthInfo).

      6. The code may either be displayed on screen or sent to your registered email.
2. **GoDaddy**: You can read in detail about transferring your domain out of GoDaddy [HERE](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in/help/transfer-my-domain-away-from-godaddy-3560).

3. **Namecheap**: You can read in detail about transferring your domain out of Namecheap [HERE](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/258/84/what-should-i-do-to-transfer-a-domain-from-namecheap/). Note: Make sure WhoisGuard is disabled before requesting the auth code.

4. **IONOS**: You can read in detail about transferring your domain out of Ionos [HERE](https://www.ionos.com/help/domains/transferring-your-domain-away-from-ionos-to-another-provider/transferring-a-domain-from-11-ionos-to-another-provider/).
4. **Submit the transfer and complete payment.** When the Confirm and Finalize Transfer button is clicked, we will:




   - Validate domain unlock status, auth code and for any other registry level statuses.

   - If the domain is valid for transfer, charge the wallet for the fee.

   - Submit the transfer request

### **Step 5:** Approve In-Progress Transfer

Once you’ve submitted your domain transfer request, the final step is to approve the transfer at your current registrar. Until you do that, the transfer stays in a pending state and won’t complete.

#### **Why Approval Is Required**

Domain transfers require explicit confirmation from your current registrar (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or IONOS) to protect against unauthorized changes. You must manually approve the transfer either through your email inbox or your registrar’s dashboard.

If no action is taken, the transfer may auto-approve after 5–7 days, depending on the registrar’s policy.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057577476/original/t1BagzEiwEYI-IHljumJsUBBah-8myD4rA.png?1762287099)

#### **How to Approve the Transfer at Your Registrar**

Here’s how to approve the transfer depending on who your registrar is:

**GoDaddy**

- Option 1: Email Approval

- Option 2: Dashboard Approval


**Namecheap**: Transfer a domain out of Namecheap.

**IONOS**: Domain Transfer Out of Ionos

- Sign in to IONOS
- Go to Domains & SSL
- Click on the domain you’re transferring
- Look for a Pending Transfer prompt or email instructions
- Approve the transfer when prompted

#### **After Transfer Approval**

Once you approve the transfer:

- Your domain is moved under our registrar partner (Cloudflare)

- You’ll see it listed under Internal Domains in your account

- You can manage DNS, renewals, and billing right inside our platform

- The Manage button becomes active so you can take further actions


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053901126/original/h7OV1ZeOjqNuyXxdoc3IuGE12V0FHJrtmA.png?1758046369)

#### **If the Transfer Is Rejected**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053901125/original/XcG-hO4K2v2R9R94beX9K13Q3p7bV4hB3g.png?1758046368)

Your transfer can be rejected if:

- You manually cancel it
- Your registrar blocks it (e.g., 60-day lock)
- You don’t approve it in time

When this happens:

- The domain status shows as Rejected
- The Transfer to Us button reappears so you can try again

### **Step 6:** After the Transfer

- Verify DNS records: make sure your domain points correctly to sites, funnels, or email.

- Reconnect products:




  - Email sending domains
  - Website/funnel domains
  - Client portal or white-label login domains
- Set up auto-renew (recommended).

* * *

## **Common Issues & Troubleshooting**

- **Auth code rejected** → Double-check with registrar, request a new code.

- **Transfer email not received** → Verify WHOIS contact email; check spam/junk folders.

- **Domain locked** → Ensure registrar lock is fully removed.

- **Transfer takes longer than 7 days** → Some registrars delay releases; check status in your current registrar’s panel.

- **Website/email downtime** → Verify DNS records were imported correctly.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How much does transferring in a domain cost?**

You’ll be charged for a 1-year renewal, added to your existing expiration date.

**Q: Can I transfer in all domain extensions?**

Most common TLDs (.com, .net, .org, etc.) are supported. Certain country-code TLDs may not be.

**Q: What if I want to transfer out later?**

You can unlock your domain and obtain an Auth code to transfer out to another registrar (see \[Domain Transfer Out guide\]).

**Q: What if some DNS records are missing after auto-scan?**

Always manually cross-check the scanned records with your current DNS provider. Auto-scanning might miss some records. You can edit, delete, or add records before finalizing the transfer.

**Q: What if my nameservers are managed by someone else (e.g., Cloudflare), but the domain is with GoDaddy?**

Then your DNS provider is Cloudflare even if your registrar is GoDaddy. When transferring the domain, your DNS setup will still be managed at Cloudflare unless you switch nameservers post-transfer.

**Q: What if my registrar and DNS provider are different?**

Then you'll need to log in to your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare) to export or review DNS records. The registrar only holds the domain, not the DNS settings.

**Q: How long does it take after I finalize the transfer?**

Once submitted, transfers typically complete within 1-5 days depending on your registrar. Some domains may complete faster if approved manually.

**Q: I don’t see the option to unlock my domain. What should I do?**

Some registrars hide this setting under “Security” or “Transfer Settings.” If it’s not visible, search their help center or contact their support.

**Q: What if my auth code is wrong?**

You’ll see an error. Double-check with your registrar and make sure the domain is also unlocked.

**Q: Will transferring my domain cause downtime?**

Not if DNS records are accurately reviewed and migrated before the transfer. Always cross-check.

**Q: Can I transfer my domain back to another registrar later?**

Yes but typically, you’ll need to wait 60 days after the last transfer, per ICANN rules.

**Q: Will transferring my domain cause downtime?**

Not if DNS records are accurately reviewed and migrated before the transfer. Always cross-check.
