# **What is Prospect Migration?**

Prospect Migration enables agencies to transfer selected prospects from the agency-level Prospecting Dashboard to a specific sub-account. This provides a more personalized and efficient way to manage leads, allowing the sub-account to engage with them using its own workflows and tools.

By migrating prospects to sub-accounts, agencies can delegate follow-up tasks to individual teams or clients while retaining visibility and ownership at the agency level. This leads to more focused marketing efforts and better lead conversion.

* * *

## **Prerequisites**

1. The destination **sub-account must have Premium Prospecting activated**.

2. You must have **existing prospects available at the agency level**.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Prospect Migration**

This feature improves operational flexibility and helps agencies scale their prospecting efforts efficiently:

- **Advanced Nurturing:** Leverage sub-account-specific automations, pipelines, and communications.

- **Operational Delegation:** Assign prospects to the appropriate sub-account for follow-up.

- **Improved Prospect Tracking:** Keep all prospect interactions centralized and organized by account.

- **Agency Control:** Migrated prospects remain accessible at the agency level for future use.

* * *

## **What Happens After Migration?**

Once migration is complete, the selected prospects:

- Are added to the sub-account’s Contacts.

- Retain their full data, notes, and history.

- Remain available in the agency account for future migration or actions.

This dual availability ensures agencies maintain full visibility and control.

## **Flexible Reuse of Prospects**

- You can migrate the same prospect to multiple sub-accounts over time.

- Prospect data remains consistent and up-to-date across locations.
