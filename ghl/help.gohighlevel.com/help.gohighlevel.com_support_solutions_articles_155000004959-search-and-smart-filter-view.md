# **What is Search and Smart Filter View?**

The Search and Smart Filter View features are tools within the **Social Planner** that enhance how you manage and organize social media content. These tools let you quickly search through post content using keywords and create reusable filtered views based on attributes like post status, channel, and category. This means you can spend less time scrolling and more time acting on the content that matters most.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Search and Smart Filter Views**

Search and filter functionality helps users stay organized and efficient by minimizing manual post sorting.

    •    Quickly locate posts using keywords from post content.

    •    Combine multiple filters to match specific post criteria.

    •    Save filter combinations as views for quick access.

    •    Customize saved views to suit evolving content strategies.

    •    Focus on post types like **Draft**, **Published**, or **Scheduled** content.

    •    Filter across platforms, categories, and more—up to 4 saved views supported.

## **Search Within Post Content**

Search allows you to quickly locate posts using specific keywords found in the content body.

This feature is especially useful when managing large volumes of posts. Instead of scrolling through pages of posts, simply enter a keyword, and matching posts will be pulled up in real time.

* * *

## **Saved Filter Views**

Saved Filter Views help you organize content for repeat workflows, like reviewing drafts or tracking scheduled posts on a specific platform.

By combining multiple filter attributes (e.g., category, status, and platform), you can create focused views that eliminate repetitive filtering every time you use the Social Planner.

You can:

    •    Create up to 4 views.

    •    Update filter combinations or rename saved views anytime.

    •    Quickly switch between views using the dropdown for efficient content management.
