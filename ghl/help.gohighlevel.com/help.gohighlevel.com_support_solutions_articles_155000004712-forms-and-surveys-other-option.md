The “Other” option for radio buttons in HighLevel Forms & Surveys lets your audience submit custom answers instead of being limited to predefined choices. Enabling this option captures richer insights and preserves respondent intent, and funnels every unique response straight into your submissions dashboard for easy review.

# **What is the 'Other' Option in Forms & Surveys?**

The “Other” option adds a write‑in field beneath any radio‑button question, empowering respondents to share an answer that isn’t listed. When enabled, their custom text is stored alongside regular choices in the form or survey submission. This feature enhances flexibility, ensuring you capture more personalized and insightful data from respondents.

## **Key Benefits of the 'Other' Option**

Adding an “Other” choice isn’t just a nice‑to‑have; it directly improves the quality of feedback you collect.

- **More Flexibility:** Collect richer, more individualized responses that go beyond standard choices

- **Better Data Insights:** Capture unique perspectives and feedback that predefined options might miss

- **Effortless Tracking:** Custom responses are stored in submission reports for easy access and review

- **User Experience:** A visible text box signals that you value every voice, even out‑of‑the‑box ideas

* * *

## **Where Custom Responses Are Stored**

- Navigate to **Forms › Submissions** (or **Surveys › Submissions**) for the asset you edited

- The write‑in answer appears in the same column you named for the radio field

- Exporting submissions to CSV will include the custom text
