**WhatsApp Template-Level Analytics**

**Gain Powerful Insights & Optimize Your Messaging Strategy**

The **Template-Level Analytics** feature in GoHighLevel’s WhatsApp integration empowers businesses with detailed performance insights for each messaging template. Previously, users had limited visibility into how well their messages were performing. Now, you can track essential engagement metrics like:

    •    Number of messages **sent**, **delivered**, and **read**

    •    **Button click** data for interactive templates (URL buttons, Quick Replies)

These insights help you fine-tune your messaging, improve engagement, and drive better customer experiences.

Templates are limited to 10 quick reply buttons. If using quick reply buttons with other buttons, buttons must be organized into two groups: quick reply buttons and non-quick reply buttons. If grouped incorrectly, the API will return an error indicating an invalid combination.

Examples of valid groupings:

1. Quick Reply, Quick Reply
2. Quick Reply, Quick Reply, URL, Phone
3. URL, Phone, Quick Reply, Quick Reply

Examples of invalid groupings:
