# **What is an Internal Notification?**

Internal Notifications are automated alerts sent to selected users, roles, or teams within your HighLevel account. These notifications are triggered by specific workflow conditions and ensure team members receive timely updates directly within their preferred communication channel.

Internal notifications are useful for sales, support, and operations teams who need immediate visibility on critical events, like new leads, completed forms, or pipeline updates.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Internal Notifications**

Internal Notifications streamline team communication and help ensure that no important update is missed.

- **Real-time updates**: Notify team members instantly about important workflow triggers.

- **Multi-channel support**: Send via email, in-app notification, SMS, or WhatsApp.

- **Role-based targeting**: Send notifications to individual users, user roles (e.g., all admins), or specific teams.

- **Improved accountability**: Ensure the right people are informed when leads or tasks are assigned.

- **Customizable content**: Personalize notifications with templates, trigger links, and dynamic fields.

## **How To Set Up Internal Notifications**

Setting up Internal Notifications in workflows is simple. Follow these steps:

### **Access Workflow Builder**

Navigate to the **Automation** tab in the left-hand menu to begin creating or editing a workflow. This is where you’ll manage all workflow actions, including Internal Notifications.

Click the **\+ Create Workflow** button at the top-right and choose whether to start from scratch, use a template, or select a recipe. This sets the foundation for building your Internal Notification setup.

### **Select** **Internal Notification** **Action**

Within your workflow builder, click on **"+"** button to open the list of available actions you can add to this workflow step. From the actions list, scroll down and select **Send Internal Notification**. This will allow you to configure alerts for team members through email, in-app, SMS, or WhatsApp.

### **Name the Action**

Enter a clear and descriptive **Action Name** for your internal notification. Using specific names (e.g., “Notify Sales Team – Email”) helps keep workflows organized and easy to manage.

### **Select Notification Type**

Choose the **Type of Notification** you want to send from the dropdown menu. Options include Email, In-App Notification, SMS, or WhatsApp, depending on how your team should be alerted. Select the channel that best fits your workflow scenario—for example, use Email for detailed updates, In-App for quick alerts, SMS for urgent notices, or WhatsApp for chat-style communication.

### **Email Notification Type**

When setting up **Email Notifications**, you’ll configure key fields that define how the message is delivered and displayed to recipients. These options ensure your emails are clear, professional, and reach the right team members.

- **From Name:** Enter the display name that will appear in the recipient’s inbox as the sender. You can also use the **tag icon** to insert custom values, making the sender details dynamic.

- **From Email:** Specify the email address that the notification should be sent from. If left blank, the system defaults will apply. You can insert **custom values** with the tag icon for greater flexibility.

- **To User Type:** Select the type of internal users who should receive the email (e.g., admins, assigned users, or specific roles). This ensures the message goes to the correct team members.

- **CC/BCC:** Add additional recipients with CC (visible to everyone) or BCC (hidden from others) for broader communication. Each entry here counts as a separate email, helping you copy stakeholders without disrupting workflow.

- **Subject:** Enter a subject line for the email to clearly indicate its purpose. If using a template with a subject line already defined, this field can be left blank. You may also use **custom values** to personalize the subject dynamically.

### **Email Content Setup**

**1\. Templates:** Select a pre-built **email template** from the dropdown to save time and maintain consistency. If needed, you can still customize the template with additional content.

**2\. Message:** Write or edit your **custom message** here. Use the toolbar for formatting and the **tag icon** to insert dynamic values (e.g., contact name, user info) for personalized notifications.

**Write with AI:** Click **Write with AI** to generate suggested content for your email message. This helps you quickly draft professional notifications that can be edited to fit your needs.

**3\. Add Attachment:** Click **Add Attachment** to include files in your notification. This is useful for sharing documents, contracts, or additional resources with your team.

### **Notification Type – Notification**

When selecting **Notification** as the type, the alert will be delivered directly inside HighLevel under the **bell icon**. This is ideal for quick updates that don’t require an email or SMS.

**1\. Type of Notification:** Choose **Notification** to send an in-app alert. These notifications are visible in the platform and help team members stay updated in real time.

**2\. Title:** Enter a concise title that appears at the top of the notification. You can also use the **tag icon** to insert dynamic values for more personalized alerts.

**3\. Message:** Write the main content of the notification. Keep it brief and actionable, and use the formatting tools or **custom values** to include relevant details.

### **Notification Redirect & Recipients**

**1\. Redirect Page:** Select the **Redirect Page** that users will land on when they click the notification. This helps guide them directly to the most relevant screen, such as a contact record or opportunity.

**2\. To User Type:** Choose the **User Type** who should receive this notification. Options include specific roles, assigned users, or teams, ensuring the right people are always informed.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052239672/original/NuKFhobJ5ZoybcjN5DsseRF2OIuU1SRDBA.png?1756048759)

### **Notification Type – SMS**

Selecting **SMS** as the notification type allows you to send text alerts directly to a user’s registered phone number. This is best for urgent or time-sensitive updates.

**1\. Type of Notification:** Choose **SMS** to deliver notifications via text message to your internal users.

**2\. To User Type:** Select which user type should receive the SMS (e.g., admins, assigned users, or teams).

**3\. Templates:** Pick from pre-built SMS templates for faster setup, or leave blank if you prefer to write a custom message.

**4\. Message:** Write the content of your SMS here. Keep it short and clear, and use the **tag icon** for custom values and **Write with AI** option for AI-assisted personalization.

### **SMS Attachments & Testing**

**1\. Add Attachment:** Click **Add Attachment** to include files in your SMS notification. This is useful for sharing supporting documents or resources with your team.

**2\. Add Files via URL:** Paste a file URL into this field and click **\+ Add** to attach files directly to the SMS. This ensures team members can access linked resources instantly.

**3\. Test Phone Number:** Enter a valid phone number (with country code) and click **Send Test SMS** to preview the notification. This helps confirm that your SMS content and attachments display correctly before sending.

### **Notification Type – WhatsApp**

Selecting **WhatsApp** allows you to send instant messages directly to team members through their registered WhatsApp numbers. This is best for real-time, conversational updates.

**1\. Type of Notification:** Choose **WhatsApp** to send notifications through the WhatsApp messaging channel.

**2\. To User Type:** Select the **user type** who should receive the WhatsApp message (e.g., admins, specific roles, or assigned users).

**3\. Templates:** Pick an approved WhatsApp template to maintain consistency and meet WhatsApp’s messaging requirements.

**4\. Message:** Enter your custom WhatsApp message here. You can personalize it using the **tag icon** for dynamic values such as user or contact details.

## **Technical Notes & Limitations**

- **Rate limiting:** By default, each user can receive up to 500 notifications (email, SMS, or in-app) every 5 minutes.

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure phone numbers, email addresses, and WhatsApp integration are properly set up.

- **External users:** Internal notifications are only for team members inside HighLevel, not for contacts or clients.

- **CC/BCC Limitations:** Only available for Email notifications. Each CC and BCC recipient increases email usage/billing.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How does HighLevel handle delivery if a user is listed in multiple recipient categories (e.g., assigned user, CC, and team)?**

HighLevel automatically deduplicates recipients across categories. This means if the same user is added in multiple recipient fields (e.g., CC and User Role), they will only receive one notification, preventing duplicates.

**Q: What happens if the notification type selected (SMS, Email, WhatsApp) is not properly configured for the recipient?**

If the chosen channel is not configured—for example, if the user does not have a valid phone number for SMS or their WhatsApp integration is not connected—the notification for that specific channel will fail. However, this does not stop the workflow from continuing to the next action.

**Q: Do attachments in Internal Notifications count toward storage or message limits?**

Yes. Attachments included in Email, SMS, or WhatsApp notifications count toward your account’s file storage and, depending on the channel, may also contribute to message size limits (e.g., SMS carriers enforce file size restrictions). Oversized files may prevent delivery, so always keep attachments small and optimized.

**Q: How are Internal Notifications affected if a workflow executes in bulk (e.g., when enrolling thousands of contacts at once)?**

Notifications are subject to HighLevel’s **rate limiting** of 500 per 5 minutes per user. If a workflow triggers bulk notifications, additional messages above this threshold are queued. Depending on system load, they may either be delivered once the limit resets or dropped if the workflow’s conditions expire.
