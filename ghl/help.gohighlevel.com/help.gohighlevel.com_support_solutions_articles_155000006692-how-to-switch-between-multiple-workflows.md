# **What is Workflow Switcher?**

Workflow Switcher is a left‑sidebar tool in **Advanced Builder** that lets you jump to other workflows quickly. It surfaces your recent workflows and a quick search, then opens the selected workflow in a **new browser tab** so your current canvas stays put—enabling safe, rapid context switching while you build.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Workflow Switcher**

- **Stay in flow:** Jump to another workflow **without leaving** your current builder tab.

- **Side‑by‑side editing:** Open the other workflow in a **new tab** to compare logic branches easily.

- **Faster reuse:** **Copy/paste** actions or branches across workflows for consistent, reusable automations.

- **Time savings:** Avoid page reloads and re‑searching; get to your next workflow in one click.

- **Reduced error risk:** Keep your current canvas intact while exploring another automation.

## **How To Use the Workflow Switcher**

Following these steps ensures you can find and open other workflows without breaking focus on your current build.
