## Step 1: Ensure Your Business is Listed on Google

1. Go to [Google My Business](https://www.google.com/business/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. If you haven't already, add your business and verify it as a service-area business.

## Step 2: Search for Your Business on Google Maps

1. Open [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
2. In the search bar, type your business name.
3. If your business appears in the results, click on it.

## Step 3: Obtain the Maps URL

### Method A: From the Address Bar

1. Once your business listing is open, look at the address bar in your browser.
2. The URL should look something like this:

```
Copy

https://www.google.com/maps/place/Your+Business+Name/@XX.XXXXXX,-YY.YYYYYY,17z/data=...
```

3. This is your Business Maps URL.

### Method B: Using the "Share" Feature

1. Click on the "Share" button in your business listing.
2. In the pop-up window, you'll see a "Copy link" option.
3. Click "Copy link" to get your Business Maps URL.


## Step 5: Use the URL in the Prospecting Tool

1. Open the Prospecting Tool in your GoHighLevel account.
2. Go to "Search for Virtual Businesses"
3. Find the "Business Maps URL" section in the form.
4. Paste the virtual GBP Maps URL you obtained in Step 3 into this section.

## Step 6: Generate More Accurate Results

1. After entering the URL, proceed with the rest of the form as usual.
2. Submit the form to generate your prospecting report.
3. The Prospecting Tool will now use this URL to provide more accurate results for your virtual or service-area business.

Using the correct virtual GBP Maps URL in the Prospecting Tool is crucial for generating accurate results for your virtual or service-area business.
