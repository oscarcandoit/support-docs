# **What is Modify Plan Category and Plan Level in SaaS Configurator?**

Agencies can edit an existing SaaS plan’s category (pricing group) and its level (order in the upgrade/downgrade path). Instead of recreating plans from scratch, you can shift a plan to a different category **that uses the same currency**, or drag it higher or lower inside a category, to redefine how customers upgrade or downgrade.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Modifying SaaS Plan Category and Plan Level**

- Protect live subscriptions – reorganize plans without forcing customers onto new products.

- Faster pricing experiments – reorder plans to test new “good / better / best” structures in minutes.

- Seamless upgrade paths – new hierarchy automatically appears when clients choose to upgrade or downgrade.

- Future-proof for multi-brand – plan mobility lays the groundwork for moving clients across brands in upcoming releases.

* * *

## **Move Plans Across Categories**

Reassign a plan to any other category **that uses the same currency** so you can group offers more logically or launch seasonal bundles. The plan keeps all of its current subscribers; only future upgrade/downgrade options change.

* * *

## **Change Plan Level within Category**

Drag-and-drop (or use the level selector) to reposition the plan’s order in its category. **Higher-level plans inherit** features from every level beneath them, so shifting a plan upward or downward changes what’s included at each tier going forward. Existing subscribers keep their current entitlements.

* * *

## **How To Modify Plan Category or Level**

Navigate to Agency View ▶ SaaS Configurator. Locate the plan you want to edit and **click Edit**.

### **Move categories:**

1. Open the Category dropdown.

2. Select a category with the same currency. (If no categories appear, create one in that currency first.)

3. Click Save.

### **Change level order:**

1. In the Plan Level field, choose the new position number or drag the plan to the desired spot in the list.

2. Confirm the on-screen summary of feature inheritance.

**Publish changes**. New upgrade/downgrade paths are live immediately for all plans in the affected categories.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will existing customers automatically gain or lose features after I move a plan?**

A: No. They keep their current subscription. Only future upgrades/downgrades use the new hierarchy.

**Q: Can I move a plan to a category with a different currency?**

A: Not at this time. The destination category must use the same currency as the plan. (ideas.gohighlevel.com)

**Q: How many times can I reorder a plan?**

A: Unlimited—plan level can be adjusted whenever your pricing strategy changes.

**Q: Does moving a plan affect active Stripe subscriptions?**

A: Stripe product IDs stay the same, so billing continues uninterrupted. Only the plan’s position inside HighLevel changes.

**Q: What happens to inherited add-ons or rebilling products?**

A: Add-ons remain attached to the plan. Higher-level plans inherit them if they sit above the moved plan after reordering.
