# **What is Tagging Channels and Events?**

Channel/event tagging turns references in your post or comment into **permission-aware, clickable links**. Type **#** to open a picker of channels and events you can access; select one to insert a tag with a distinctive icon. Readers can click the tag to navigate directly to that channel or event (access required).

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Tagging Channels and Events**

Use these benefits to decide when to tag and how to structure posts that drive readers to the right destination.

- **Faster navigation**: Readers jump straight to the referenced channel or event.

- **Clear context**: Icons and links make intent obvious inside long threads.

- **Targeted engagement**: Tags turn posts into actionable prompts for members.

- **Permission-aware visibility**: Only channels/events you can access appear in the picker.


* * *

## **Permissions & Prerequisites**

Confirm access first so tags appear in the picker and work when clicked.

- **Who can tag**: Any user who can create a post or comment in the community.

- **What you’ll see**: The **#** picker shows only channels/events you have permission to access.

- **Where to tag**: Communities → open a **post** or **comment** editor.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I tag multiple channels or events in one post?**

Yes—add as many as are relevant, but keep posts readable and focused.

**Q: Why don’t I see a channel/event in the list?**

Only items you have access to appear in the picker. Confirm your permissions or membership.

**Q: What do the icons mean?**

Icons visually distinguish **channels** from **events** so readers know what they’re opening.

**Q: What happens if an event has already ended?**

The tag may open a read-only or ended view, depending on event settings.
