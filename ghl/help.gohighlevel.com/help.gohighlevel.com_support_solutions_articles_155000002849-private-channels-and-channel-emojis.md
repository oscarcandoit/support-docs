##### **Things to Note:**

- The group owner and channel creator are automatically added as channel managers.
- A channel manager acts as an admin for that specific channel. Group roles like owner and group admin do not have significance within a private channel.
- The group owner cannot leave a private channel.
- Private channels will not be visible in the channel list to users who are not part of them.


#### **Channel Emojis**

You can now add emojis as channel icons. This feature allows you to customize your channel icons, making them more fun and visually distinct.
