You can also view engagement trends over time, analyse conversions, and access detailed recipient-level data such as who opened, clicked, or unsubscribed from your email.

* * *

### **Delivered**

The percentage of emails that were successfully delivered to recipients’ inboxes (out of all emails sent).

> **Formula:** (Delivered / Total Sent) × 100

A high delivery rate (90%+) indicates good sender reputation and clean contact lists.

* * *

### **Opened**

The percentage of recipients who opened your email at least once.

> **Formula:** (Unique Opens / Delivered) × 100

This helps measure how effective your subject line and sender name are at grabbing attention.

* * *

### **Clicked**

The percentage of recipients who clicked at least one link in your email.

> **Formula:** (Unique Clicks / Delivered) × 100

A higher click rate shows strong engagement and effective content or CTA placement.

* * *

### **Conversion**

The percentage of recipients who completed a desired action (like a purchase, booking, or signup) after clicking through your email.

> **Formula:** (Conversions / Delivered) × 100

If conversions are tracked, this metric helps evaluate campaign ROI and goal success.

* * *

### **Soft Bounced**

Emails that were temporarily undeliverable due to issues like a full inbox or temporary server problem.

> **Tip:** These may still succeed if retried later.

* * *

### **Hard Bounced**

Emails that failed permanently, for example, invalid addresses or blocked domains.

> **Tip:** Regularly clean your contact list to avoid high hard bounce rates (keep below 2%).

* * *

### **Unsubscribed**

The percentage of recipients who opted out using your unsubscribe link.

> **Formula:** (Unsubscribed / Delivered) × 100

A small unsubscribe rate (under 1%) is normal, but higher numbers may indicate irrelevant content or excessive frequency.

* * *

### **Skipped**

When the email is ready to go but skipped due to most likely

- Any internal issue while sending the email to specific contact
- If contact is dnd

* * *

### **Spam**

The percentage of emails reported as spam by recipients.

> **Tip:** Maintain a healthy sending reputation by avoiding spam-triggering keywords and ensuring audience relevance.

* * *

## **Engagement Analysis Chart**

Below the summary, the **Engagement Analysis** graph visually displays your campaign’s key performance trends —

- **Delivered** (green line)

- **Opened** (blue line)

- **Clicked** (orange line)


You can view engagement activity across selected date ranges to identify when most interactions occurred.

> **Tip:** Peaks in the chart often indicate the best-performing send days or hours for your audience.

* * *

## **Conversion Summary and Analysis**

If your campaign includes e-commerce or goal-tracking setup, this section displays:

- **Revenue:** Total income generated from the email.

- **RPR (Revenue per Recipient):** Average revenue earned per recipient.

- **Conversion Analysis Chart:** Tracks the number of orders or conversions over time.


> **Note:** If revenue tracking isn’t set up, these fields will display as $0.
