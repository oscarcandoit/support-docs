# **Handling Calls with the AI Agents**

### **Inbound Calls**

- **Call Routing:** Incoming calls to the assigned number are automatically handled by the AI agent during working hours.

- **After-Hours Handling:** Calls received outside working hours follow the settings you’ve configured (e.g., forwarded to voicemail or another number).

### **Call Actions**

During calls, the agent can perform various actions to help you manage contact data and move the lead or customer into the next step in the process.

- **Update Contact Fields:** Automatically saves collected information to the customer’s contact record.

- **Trigger Workflows:** Initiates predefined workflows based on call content.

- **End Calls:** Concludes the call politely when appropriate.

- **Transfer Calls:** Connects the caller to a human agent under certain conditions.

- **Send SMS:** Dispatches text messages with relevant information or follow-ups.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use my existing GHL phone numbers with the AI Voice Agent?**

Yes, you can assign any available phone number in your account to the AI agent, provided it isn’t already configured for other specialized functions like IVR.

Absolutely. The agent can collect details such as name, email, and address, and automatically update or create contact records in your CRM.

**Q: Can the AI Agent handle call routing and transfers?**

Yes, the agent can be configured to transfer calls to human agents based on specific conditions you define.

**Q: Is re-billing available if I want to resell the AI Employee to my customers?**

Re-billing options are available. Please contact our support team for more details on setting up re-billing for your agency.

**Q:** **Does AI Employee (Voice AI) work for Phone System only or does it work with my own Twilio account too?**
