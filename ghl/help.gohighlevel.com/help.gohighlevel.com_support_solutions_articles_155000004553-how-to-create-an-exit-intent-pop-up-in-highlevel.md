# **What is an Exit Intent Pop-up?**

Exit intent pop-ups are triggered when a user's cursor behavior indicates they are about to leave your site, typically by moving toward the browser bar or close button. HighLevel enables you to design pop-ups within the website or funnel builder and configure them to trigger based on exit intent.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Exit Intent Pop-ups**

Exit-intent pop-ups can significantly boost lead capture and conversion by offering a last-chance call-to-action. Here's what makes them valuable:

- **Reduce bounce rate:** Prevent users from leaving without engaging by presenting an offer right before they exit.

- **Capture abandoning visitors:** Use one final message or incentive to collect lead information before the user leaves.

- **Boost conversion rates:** Exit pop-ups can turn hesitant users into leads with time-limited deals or special discounts.

- **Customizable content:** Design the look, layout, and form fields of your pop-up to fit your brand.

- **Flexible form integration:** Embed any HighLevel form to collect emails, phone numbers, or other key data.

- **Works within funnel and website builder:** No need for third-party tools—exit-intent behavior is built into HighLevel’s editor.

## **How To Create an Exit Intent Pop-up**

Follow these steps to build your exit-intent pop-up from form creation to trigger configuration.

#### **Step 1:** Create a Form for Your Pop-up

Forms are what allow you to collect information from users in the pop-up. Start by creating or locating the form you want to use in the pop-up.

#### **Step 2:** Create the Pop-Up

Now you'll create pop-up within a funnel or website builder page and add the form that was created.

- Navigate to **Sites → Funnels or Websites** and select the funnel or website you want to use

- Locate the specific **funnel step or page** that the pop-up will be added to. Click the blue **Edit** button to open that website page or funnel step in the builder

- In the top navigation bar of the website builder, click **Pop-up Settings**

- Click **Add Row,** then **Add Element** to add a Form element to the Pop-Up.Use the **form picker** to select your desired form

- Customize the pop-up design to match your branding.

- (Optional) Use the **sidebar dropdown** to switch the selected form after adding the initial form.

#### **Step 3:** Set the Pop-up to Trigger on Exit Intent

To make the pop-up appear when users attempt to leave, you need to configure the correct setting.

- Click the blue button named **Pop Up Settings** with the **gear icon** at the top of the pop-up.

- In the sidebar, scroll to **"Show Pop-up On".**

- From the dropdown, choose **Exit.** Selecting "None" or "Delay" will disable or change the intended behavior

#### **Step 4:** Test the Pop-up

Once saved and published, test that the Pop-Up is working as desired.

- Preview the page or funnel step

- Move your cursor toward the top of the browser (as if exiting)

- Confirm the pop-up appears

- Adjust styling and content as needed

## **Desktop vs Mobile Behavior**

Exit intent detection uses mouse cursor tracking, so it only works on desktop. This behavior does not function on mobile because touchscreens lack a cursor.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use an exit-intent pop-up on a non-HighLevel website?**

No. Exit-intent pop-ups are only supported on funnels and websites built inside HighLevel.

**Q: What happens if I choose "None" or "Delay" instead of "Exit"?**

The pop-up won't behave as an exit-intent prompt. "None" disables it, and "Delay" will show the pop-up after a time delay instead of cursor exit.

**Q: Can I use different forms for different pop-ups?**

Yes. You can assign different forms to individual pop-ups on each funnel step or page.

**Q: Can I preview the pop-up before going live?**

Yes. Use the page preview option inside the builder to test behavior before publishing.

**Q: Does the pop-up styling match my site?**

You can fully customize the pop-up's row, column, background, and form styles to match your site branding.
