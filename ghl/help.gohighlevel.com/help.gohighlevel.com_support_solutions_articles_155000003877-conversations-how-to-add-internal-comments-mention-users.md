# Conversations - How to Add Internal Comments & Mention Users

Modified on: Tue, 16 Sep, 2025 at 12:14 PM

Use Internal Comments and @mentions in HighLevel Conversations to collaborate privately inside a contact thread without exposing notes to the contact. This article defines what internal comments and @mentions are, who can use them, and how to post, search, and notify teammates.

# **What is Internal Comments in Conversations?**

Internal comments are private notes you add to a conversation thread that are never sent to or visible by the contact. When you type @ and select a teammate, that person is mentioned and can be notified to review or act, keeping handoffs tight and context in one place. **Internal Comments ≠ Internal Chat.** Internal Chat is a separate team chat experience.

```
Note: Internal comments in Conversations cannot be edited or deleted once posted.
```

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Internal Comments in Conversations**

These benefits help you decide when to use internal comments versus sending messages or switching to team chat.

- **Private collaboration:** Keep sensitive notes and decisions out of the contact’s view.

- **Targeted notifications:** @mention the right teammate to get timely eyes on the thread.

- **Faster handoffs:** Assign context and next steps without leaving the conversation.

- **Searchable context:** Retrieve internal notes with filters to speed up QA and audits.
