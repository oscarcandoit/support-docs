### **Step 2:** Add or Update the Payment Element

- If you are collecting payments in your forms, surveys, websites, or funnels, simply add the payment element to enable PayPal buttons during the checkout experience.

- If you already have a payment element and are now adding PayPal as a payment option, ensure that your Payment Element is updated to the latest version that supports PayPal.

```
Note :

If you are collecting payments in your Forms or Surveys, add the “Collect Payment” element to enable PayPal buttons during the checkout experience.

If you are collecting payments in your Funnels or Websites, use the 1-Step or 2-Step Order Form elements instead. These now support PayPal automatically — no additional payment element is needed.

If you added the order form before Nov 1st, 2024, delete it and re-add it to ensure compatibility with PayPal.

### **Step 3:** Preview Payment Element

- In order to see the PayPal buttons in your payment element, you will need to preview your form, survey, website, or funnel.

```
IMPORTANT: You will NOT see the buttons when adding the payment element in the form, survey, website, or funnel builder.
