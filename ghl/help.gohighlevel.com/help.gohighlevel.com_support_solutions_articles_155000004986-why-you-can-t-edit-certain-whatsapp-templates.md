# Why You Can’t Edit Certain WhatsApp Templates

Modified on: Tue, 18 Nov, 2025 at 11:34 AM

If you've tried editing a WhatsApp message template and found the option unavailable, you're not alone. There are several reasons why certain templates can't be modified. Here’s a quick breakdown of why this might be happening — and what you can do about it.

### **1\. The Template Is Already Approved by Meta**

Once a template has been approved by Meta, its content becomes locked. While minor adjustments like changing the template name or category may still be possible, you _cannot_ edit the body, header, or footer text. If you need to make content changes, you'll have to create a new template from scratch.

### **2\. The Template Was Created via the API**

Templates created directly through the WhatsApp API or a third-party partner tool may not be editable from your platform’s user interface. These templates are typically locked for security and consistency reasons.

### **3\. The Template Is In Use or Was Sent Recently**

If a template is currently being used in active workflows or conversations—or was recently sent—it may be temporarily locked from editing. This helps ensure message consistency and prevent disruptions in communication.

### **4\. The Template Falls Under a Strict Category (e.g., “Authentication”)**

Certain categories, like **Authentication** (used for sending OTPs, verification codes, etc.), have much stricter rules. Meta requires these templates to follow a specific format and wording, which means you won’t be able to edit them beyond allowed parameters.

### **5\. The Template Is Under Review or Has Been Flagged**

If Meta has flagged a template for low quality or it's under review, editing will be restricted until the issue is resolved. This ensures compliance with WhatsApp’s messaging policies and user experience standards.

## **What You Can Do**

If you're unable to edit a template, here are a few alternatives:

### **Clone the Template**

Duplicate the existing template and make the necessary changes to the new version before submitting it for approval. To clone an existing WhatsApp Template:

1. Navigate to **Settings** \> **WhatsApp** \> **Templates**

2. Click the **3 Dot** icon next to the template and from the dropdown menu, select **Clone** **Template** **.**

3. Rename and edit the new template then click **Save**

4. Submit the new template for approval

### **Delete the Old Template**

If it’s no longer needed or relevant, you can delete the original version to keep your template list clean and up to date.
