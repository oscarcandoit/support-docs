# How to Create Multiple Popups Per Page for Funnels and Websites

Modified on: Wed, 27 Aug, 2025 at 9:59 AM

Launch unlimited popups, each with its own trigger, style, and content, inside a single funnel or website page. You can fire a welcome offer after three seconds, display an exit-intent survey when someone tries to leave, and reveal a bonus form on button click, all without cloning pages or writing custom scripts.

# **What Is the Multiple Popup Feature?**

The Multiple Popups per Page feature enables you to create, customize, and manage several distinct popups on one funnel or website page. Each popup can have unique content, positioning, and trigger conditions, making it easy to deliver specific messages tailored to your audience's actions or behaviors. This feature simplifies managing multiple marketing messages without needing workarounds or coding.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using Multiple Popups per Page**

Multiple popups provide powerful flexibility for engaging visitors:

- **Improved Targeting:** Display precise messages based on user behavior or journey stage

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Keep pages clean by avoiding cluttered content in the main layout while delivering offers in context

- **Increased Conversions:** Deliver targeted offers and lead-capture forms at optimal moments such as on exit

- **Easy Management:** Customize and manage each popup without technical complications

- **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminate complex workarounds like multiple pages or custom scripts

* * *

## **How to Create a New Popup**

Follow these steps to create your first (or fifth) pop-up in seconds:

1. Open any page in the Site or Funnel Builder. Click the **Popup Settings** button in the top navigation bar

- **Create New:** Click **Create New Popup** to add additional popups

## **Customizing Popup Appearance & Positioning**

Customize how each popup looks and where it shows up on your page to align precisely with your design and engagement goals. Every pop-up has the same design tools you use on sections. Use the options within Popup Settings to customize each popup individually.

- **Popup Positioning:** Set the popup location to left, center, or right within popup settings

- **Visual Customization:** Modify background color, overlays, spacing, and content elements, just like regular page sections

- **Spacing & Sizing:** Adjust padding, margins, and max width for desktop, tablet, and mobile

- **Popup Triggers:** Choose specific triggers for each popup, including delay, exit-intent, or interaction-based triggers such as clicks on buttons, images, or text links


* * *

## **Setting Popup Triggers**

Control precisely when and how each popup is displayed by setting triggers. Triggers determine exactly when (or why) each pop-up appears. Below are the available trigger options:

- **Delay:** Choose a time in seconds after the page loads

- **Exit Intent:** Trigger a popup when the visitor attempts to leave your page

- **None:** Manually triggered popups (usually linked to buttons, images, or text)


[Popups can also be triggered by clicking on linked buttons, images, or text.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005815-how-to-create-multiple-popups-per-page-for-funnels-and-websites#Linking-Popups-to-Buttons,-Images-&-Text)

#### **To Set a Trigger:**

1. Select the pop-up in the sidebar.

2. Open the Settings tab.

3. Under the **Show Popup On** dropdown, pick Delay, Exit Intent, or None (for click-only pop-ups).

4. If you chose Delay, enter the number of seconds.

2. In the **Link To** dropdown, choose **Open Popup**

3. Select the desired popup from the dropdown menu
