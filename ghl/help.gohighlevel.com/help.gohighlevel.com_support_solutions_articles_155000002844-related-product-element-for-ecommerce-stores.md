# Related Product element for Ecommerce stores

Modified on: Fri, 19 Jul, 2024 at 4:15 AM

### About:

Gohighlevel now allows store owners to suggest related products on their product details page. This feature helps improve the overall product discovery experience by showcasing recommended or related products to users, thereby enhancing cross-selling opportunities.

### How to use

1. Navigate to your store
Product detail
    in the page builder, and enable the
Show related products
    toggle. The following attributes can be customised:
1. Number of products to be shown ( _Default: 6_)
2. Number of columns per product in both desktop and mobile ( _Default: Desktop: 3_, _Mobile: 2_)
3. Heading for the related products section ( _Default: "You may also like"_)

      ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029535856/original/jnPormYrpDPns23VMEx3bQFGVO1nDJVqvg.png?1721380312)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029535866/original/chDlIV--fBj5PP859N_MS8t4kmYw55GcSA.png?1721380326)

2. Save and publish the page

### Note:

1. Products that are present in a common collection will be shown under related products in the product detail page of that specific product. For example:
1. A product named "iPhone 15" if is added to collection "Apple" and "Summer Sale"
2. All the products added in the collection "Apple" and "Summer Sale" would be displayed
3. At first all the products from "Apple" collection would be present and then products from "Summer Sale" would be displayed provided that they are within the available limits of related products set by the user which is at maximum capped to 10

2. The images in both the product list page now, are restricted to a
1:1 aspect ratio
and the images are covered to that size to maintain better UI and consistency across all products and images.
