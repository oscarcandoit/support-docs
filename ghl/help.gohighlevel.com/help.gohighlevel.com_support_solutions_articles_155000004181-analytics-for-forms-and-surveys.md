Our analytics give you a clear, no‑fluff view of how forms and surveys perform over time. Track views, responses, completion rate, average time, and (for surveys) slide‑level views and drop‑off so you can spot friction and improve conversions fast.

## **Overview**

Analytics for Forms and Surveys provides both at‑a‑glance and deeper insights. From high‑level trends (views, responses, completion) to slide‑level drop‑off in surveys, you’ll see where people fall off and where they jump ahead—so you can fix issues and ship improvements with confidence.

* * *

## Key Benefits

- **See performance clearly:** Total views, responses, completion rate, and average completion time.

- **Compare over time:** Previous‑period comparison to confirm trends and spot anomalies.

- **Pinpoint friction:** Slide‑level drop‑off highlights where respondents abandon (or jump ahead).

- **Flexible filters:** Focus on a specific form/survey or review all assets over any date range.


* * *

## **Available Filters and Metrics**

Use filters to focus on the exact asset and timeframe you care about, then read the on-screen metrics to understand engagement, completions, and where users drop off. Pairing the right filters with the right metrics helps you pinpoint issues and validate improvements quickly.

**Filters**

- **Type:** Forms or Surveys (top‑left)

- **Asset:** All or a specific Form/Survey

- **Date Range:** Presets (Last 7/14/30/60/90 days) or Custom

**Metrics**

- **Total Views:** How many times the selected asset(s) were viewed in the chosen date range

- **Responses:** Completed submissions

- **Average Time:** Average completion time

- **Completion Rate:** % of responses vs views, with an automatic previous‑period comparison

- **Total Views chart:** Line chart to spot increases or declines

- **Per‑Asset Breakdown:** Table of Total Views per Form/Survey (shown when viewing **All** assets)


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052527746/original/di80EXtVFGF-XYICuhUZt4VfgpcsecnxXA.png?1756317018)

- **Survey Views:** Only available for Surveys and only when a single survey is selected in the filter




  - **Slide View:** The step within the survey metrics refer to

  - **Views:** How many respondents reached that slide

  - **Drop-Off:** How many exited on that slide (Count followed by the percentage). Use this to identify slides that should be improved and tested

* * *

## **How to Use the Analytics Dashboard**

1. **Navigate:** From the left menu, go to **Sites** → top navigation **Analytics**.

2. **Select Filters:** Choose **Type** (Forms/Surveys), pick an **Asset** (All or a specific one), and set a **Date Range**.

3. **Read the Data:** Review metric cards, charts, and (for a single survey) the slide‑level table.


> Tip: Switch the **Asset** to a single survey to see per‑slide **Views** and **Drop‑Off**.

## **Survey Slide‑Level Metrics (Views & Drop‑Off)**

When a **single survey** is selected, you’ll see a per‑slide table.

**Columns**

- **Slide** — step number/title

- **Views** — sessions that reached the slide

- **Drop‑Off** — change vs the previous slide (shown as a **count** and a **%**)


### **How Drop‑Off is calculated**

For slide **n** (where n > 1):

- **Drop‑Off (count)** = Views(n‑1) − Views(n)

- **Drop‑Off (%)** = Drop‑Off(count) ÷ Views(n‑1) × 100


Notes:

- Slide 1 has no prior slide → **Drop‑Off = N/A**

- **Positive** Drop‑Off = fewer people reached the current slide (a drop)

- **Negative** Drop‑Off = more people reached the current slide (a gain)


### **Why Drop‑Off can be negative**

Negative values mean the current slide had **more views** than the previous slide. Common causes:

- **Jump/skip logic** routes respondents past the previous slide

- **Legacy “move to slide based on option”** (radio/checkbox) skips slides

- **Slide re‑ordering** after data collection changes which slide counts as “previous”


**Quick example**

- Slide 1: 100 views

- Slide 2: 93 views → Drop‑Off = 100 − 93 = **7 (7%)**

- Slide 3: 98 views (5 jumped from 1 → 3) → Drop‑Off = 93 − 98 = **‑5 (‑5.4%)**


### **Troubleshooting Checklist for Negative Drop‑Off**

- **Check conditional logic:** Did you use jump/skip rules that route to this slide?

- **Check for legacy routing:** Using the older “move to slide based on radio/checkbox option” can skip slides.

- **Check slide order changes:** Did you reorder slides during the selected date range?

- **Align dates:** If you changed logic or slide order recently, ensure your date filter matches the timeframe you want to analyze.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How is the “previous period” comparison determined?**

It compares your selected date range to the immediately preceding, equal-length period (e.g., Last 14 days vs the prior 14 days).

**Q: Why is the per-form/survey breakdown missing?**

The per-form/survey breakdown appears only when viewing All forms/surveys. Selecting a single asset hides the aggregate breakdown.

**Q: I selected a survey but don’t see the per-slide analysis table. Why?**

The slide analysis appears only when a single, specific survey is selected. If you’re on All surveys, switch the asset selector to the exact survey to view Slide, Views, Drop-off, and Drop-off rate.

**Q: What analytics types can I choose in the top-left dropdown?**

You can select Forms or Surveys. The dropdown also includes other types (funnels, websites, QR codes, blogs)

**Q: The table says “Drop‑Off,” but I see negative numbers. What does that mean?**

Negative Drop‑Off means the current slide had **more views** than the previous slide (a net gain). This often happens with jump/skip logic, legacy “move to slide based on option,” or after reordering slides.

**Q: Why don’t I see the slide table?**

The slide table appears only when a **single survey** is selected. Switch the Asset filter from **All surveys** to a specific survey.
