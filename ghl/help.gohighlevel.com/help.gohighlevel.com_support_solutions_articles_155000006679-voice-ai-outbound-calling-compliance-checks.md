# **What is Voice AI Outbound Calling Compliance?**

Voice AI Outbound Calling Compliance is an automated safeguard that reviews every location, contact, and phone-number detail before an outbound AI call is placed. The feature ensures you:

- pass Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification

- capture legally valid opt-in language

- respect strict rate-limit, DND, and calling-hour rules

Automated compliance will reject any non-compliant call before it dials.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Voice AI Outbound Calling Compliance**

- Instant KYC approval keeps your brand eligible for outbound AI calls.

- Automatic Terms & Conditions scanning pinpoints missing or weak consent text.

- Real-time opt-in checks prevent dialing contacts without proper permission.

- Built-in rate and daily-limit throttling eliminates manual math and guesswork.

- Time-zone-aware call-hour guardrails (10 AM–6 PM) reduce TCPA risk—tighter than the federal 8 AM–9 PM window (ftc.gov).

- Pre-call rejections save credits and protect your reputation with carriers and consumers.

* * *

## **Location Compliance**

Outbound calls originate only from locations that have explicitly enabled outbound AI calling and completed KYC. HighLevel blocks calls from any location that fails either requirement.

* * *

## **Contact Compliance**

Before dialing, the system confirms:

- Documented opt-in (currently captured via HighLevel forms).

- No Do-Not-Disturb (DND) flag on the voice channel.

- No previous opt-out from the contact.

Non-compliant contacts trigger an immediate call rejection.

* * *

## **Call Rate, Daily & Phone-Number Limits**

HighLevel enforces FCC-friendly throttles automatically:

- Rate: 1 call per minute per location.

- Daily: Max 100 calls per location; excess calls auto-roll to the next day.

- Phone-Number-Specific: 1 call per day and no more than 4 calls in a rolling 14-day window; U.S. numbers only.

* * *

## **Call Hours Rules**

Calls may fire only between 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM in the contact’s phone-number time zone—stricter than the FTC’s 8 AM–9 PM rule for telemarketing (ftc.gov). HighLevel calculates the zone automatically, blocking calls outside the window.

* * *

## **Real-Time Compliance Scanning**

When you click Enable Outbound Calls, HighLevel:

- Runs KYC instantly.

- Scans your latest Terms & Conditions (starting with forms) for valid consent wording.

- Surfaces missing opt-in text so you can update assets before calling.

These scans repeat in the background to keep you current as consent language evolves.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q : Why is the call window limited to 10 AM–6 PM when federal law allows 8 AM–9 PM?**

A : HighLevel set a narrower window to account for stricter state-level rules and reduce consumer complaints.

**Q : What happens if I exceed 100 calls in one day?**

A : Additional calls are automatically scheduled for the next eligible day; no manual rescheduling needed.

**Q : How does HighLevel verify opt-ins collected outside of HighLevel forms?**

A : At launch, automated checks focus on HighLevel forms. Add external-source contacts only after confirming written consent manually.

**Q : Can I disable individual compliance rules?**

A : No. All rules are mandatory to maintain Voice AI outbound calling eligibility.

**Q : Will rejected calls consume Voice AI minutes or credits?**

A : No. Rejections occur before dialing, so no minutes are billed.

**Q : Does KYC need to be repeated?**

A : Only if your business ownership or legal details change. Otherwise, it remains valid.

**Q : Are international numbers supported?**

A : Not at this time; outbound AI calls are restricted to U.S. phone numbers.
