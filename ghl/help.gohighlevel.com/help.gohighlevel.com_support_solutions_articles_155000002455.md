Communities themes allow you to customize the appearance of your group interface to match your preferences. Themes can be adjusted for both light and dark modes, and you can either choose from predefined themes or create your own custom theme.

## **Admin/Owner View:** Accessing Theme Settings    Make sure to turn it on from Labs

To change your theme settings:

1. Open Settings: Inside your community group, click on your right side bar and click on bottom “SETTINGS”.
2. Navigate to themes: Select "Themes" from the sidebar.


## Choosing a New Theme

If you use multiple groups, try selecting a different theme for each one to help you tell them apart. Your new theme will appear in the broser.

- **Light or Dark Mode:**

In the Themes section, you can switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode using the buttons at the top.


- ### **Select a Predefined Theme:**  Select Communities theme tab and **scroll** through the list of available themes. Click on a theme to preview it. Once you find a theme you like, it will automatically apply to your Communities interface.


Note: Themes are reflected only in Web and not mobile.

## Creating a Custom Theme

As a group owner/admin, in the "Custom Themes" tab, users can customize various components of the group interface. For each mode i.e. Light Mode and Dark Mode, the admin will have to customise and Save the customisations separately.

S **croll** through the list of available customisation options:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Options | What will change in your group |
| Sidebar Background | Background colour of the sidebar with top bar |
| Primary | Button colours |
| Background | Surface elements and modals |
| Tertiary | Links and elements of selection(radio buttons/checkboxes). |
| Surface | Base of the interface |
| Primary Font | Main Context |
| Secondary Font | Selected context |
| Fill colour | Hover colour |
| Borders | All borders |
| Error | Error in interaction |

Click on the colour swatches to open the colour picker or enter a hex code directly.
