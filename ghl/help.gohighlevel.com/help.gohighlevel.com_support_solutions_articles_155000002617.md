## **How does you client setup the Branded Client Portal mobile App?**

The Help article guides through the detailed step by step process

[https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002608-how-to-setup-branded-client-portal-mobile-app](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002608-how-to-setup-branded-client-portal-mobile-app)

* * *

## **How does the billing work?**

When your client purchases Branded Client Portal App it creates 2 subscriptions in the System

1. Between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients
2. Between HighLevel & your Stripe account, you pay $79/month/location to HighLevel ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155027283088/original/NDX58TboojyTCXU7ksrQiga0aQzDRpgUfQ.png?1717757020)

* * *

## **App Subscription Inactive Warning**

Users of Branded Mobile Apps will see a special screen when there is problem with their subscription (paused or cancelled). This makes it clear that:

- Their branded app is no longer live

- Action is required to renew the subscription

- Their customers are affected, adding urgency and visibility to the situation


This screen helps highlight the impact of cancellation and encourages timely resubscription, ultimately helping reduce churn. It also provides a convenient Resubscribe & Reignite My App button to fix the issue.
