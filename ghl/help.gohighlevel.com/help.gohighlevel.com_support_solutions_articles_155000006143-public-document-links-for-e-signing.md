Public Document Links allow you to quickly share and collect signatures on standard agreements without needing to create or add a contact. With a simple link, anyone can access, review, and sign your document—making this feature ideal for on-the-go agreements and one-time signers.

## **What’s New?**

•Public Document Creation – Build public documents for signing directly in Documents & Contracts > Templates.

•Shareable Links – Each published document generates a unique link for easy sharing.

•Response Management – View and download all signatures and responses in one place.

•Workflow Compatibility – Continue using templates in workflows; Public Document Links work independently.

## **How to Use**

1\. Create a Public Document

•Navigate to Documents & Contracts > Templates.

•Click New Template > Publish, or select New > Create Public Document.

2\. Share the Document

•Once published, copy the generated public link.

•Share it with recipients through email, chat, or any communication channel.

3\. Signing Process for Recipients

•Recipients open the link, enter their first name, last name, and email, then sign.

•A signed copy is automatically emailed to the recipient.

4\. Manage Responses

•Go to the Responses section to view or download signed documents.

5\. Unpublish a Document

•To stop accepting new signatures, unpublish the document at any time.

## **Why This Matters**

Public Document Links provide a fast and flexible signing option when:

•You don’t need to store a new contact.

•You want an agreement signed quickly outside of a workflow.

•You need a repeatable template that anyone can access via link.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

Q: Can I still use my existing document templates in workflows?

Yes. Public Document Links are optional. All existing templates remain fully functional in workflows.

Q: Do recipients need an account to sign?

No. They only need to provide their name and email.

Q: Where do I find signed documents?

Signed copies and responses are stored in the Responses section.

Q: Do recipients get a copy of what they signed?

Yes. A signed copy is automatically emailed to them.

Q: Can I turn off a link after sharing it?

Yes. Unpublishing the document disables the link immediately.

Q: How many people can sign through one Public Document link?

There’s no limit—multiple people can sign until you unpublish the link.
