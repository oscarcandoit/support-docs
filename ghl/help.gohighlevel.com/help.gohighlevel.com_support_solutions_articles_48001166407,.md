# **Why Should You Customize Your Calendar?**

If you want to **maintain brand consistency**, then making sure your assets are all using the same color scheme is very important!

Customizing assets such as booking calendars can help you **stand out to your audience**, and will help you **maintain a neat and buttoned-up appearance** to customers and prospects.

As you can see in the image below, the logo for the company is clearly red, but all the elements in the calendar are blue. To maintain brand consistency, **the colors in the calendar should be red to match the logo.**

IMPORTANT: You can ONLY customize the colors of your calendar if you are using the NEO calendar style.
```

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Calendar Settings

In order to customize your calendar colors, you'll need to navigate to the calendar settings section. You can get there by going to the **CALENDARS** tab in the main navigation, then clicking the **CALENDAR SETTINGS** button in the secondary navigation at the top of the screen.

### **Step 2:** Edit Calendar

Once you're in the calendar settings section, you'll need to either create a new calendar or open an already existing calendar in order to edit the colors.

**Click the** **3-dot icon** located in the far right side of the calendar table in the column titled **"ACTION DROPDOWN"**. You'll see a small popup after clicking the icon, and in that popup you'll see a button labeled **"EDIT"**.

Click the **"EDIT"** button to start editing that particular calendar.

### **Step 3:** Navigate to "Customization" Tab

After you've entered the editing section for your calendar, you'll see a small navigation bar on the left side of your screen. The bottom option in this navigation is labeled **"CUSTOMIZATIONS"**.

Click the **"CUSTOMIZATIONS"** tab in order to adjust your calendar's colors.

### **Step 4:** Customize Colors

Once you're in the **"CUSTOMIZATIONS"** tab, scroll down until you see the color pickers. You will see 2 options to change colors in your calendar, **Primary Color** and **Background Color**. Within these 2 options, you can adjust your calendar colors using HEXA codes or by sliding the picker around on the color selector.

**HEXA -** These codes begin with a # and are used by many businesses to maintain an exact brand color across many different business assets.

**COLOR SLIDER -** By clicking on the small circle in the color picker, you can slide around and pick the exact color that fits your brand or style.
