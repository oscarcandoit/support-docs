# **What is the Product Element?**

The Product Element allows you to showcase a product—including an image, description, and a purchase link—inside an email built using HighLevel’s Email Builder. Previously limited to Campaign emails, this element is now available in Email Templates, offering greater flexibility in designing reusable marketing emails.

# **Key Benefits of the Product Element in Email Templates**

Unlock enhanced flexibility and consistency when building product-focused emails directly in your templates.

- Create consistent product layouts across Campaigns and Templates

- Save time by reusing product layouts in multiple email flows

- Support e-commerce use cases within automated workflows

- Customize product descriptions and CTA buttons

- Maintain branding and design consistency across emails

- Integrate with redirect links for custom purchase journeys


# **How To Use the Product Element in Email Templates**

Learn how to drag, drop, and customize the Product Element when building an email template for marketing or sales.

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Emails > Templates**

2. Click **\+ New** to create a new email template

3. Choose a layout or start from scratch

4. Drag and drop the **Product** element into your email body

5. Click on the Product block to edit:

   - Select a product

   - Add title, description, and image (auto-pulls from product record)

   - Set a **custom redirection link**

   - Customize button text
6. Save your template and use it in Workflows, Campaigns, or Broadcasts


# **Important Notes About Checkout Links**

Direct checkout links behave differently in Templates compared to Campaign Mode.

- **Direct Checkout Links only work in Campaign Mode.**

- When using Templates, use a **custom redirection link** to guide users to your checkout page or product URL manually.

- Ensure that your product setup in **Payments > Products** includes all necessary data (name, price, image).

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use the Product Element in automation emails?**

Yes. Templates using the Product Element can be inserted into Workflow emails.

**Q: Do direct checkout links work in templates?**

No. Direct checkout links only work when the email is sent in Campaign Mode. In templates, use a custom URL redirect.

**Q: Where do I configure the product details?**

Go to **Payments > Products** in your HighLevel dashboard to manage product information.

**Q: Can I add multiple products in one email?**

Yes. You can drag in multiple Product Elements to display multiple products in one template.

**Q: Can I customize the product design?**

Yes. You can edit layout, spacing, font, colors, and button styles for the Product Element.

### **Next Steps**

- Try adding a Product Element to your next Email Template.

- Review your Product setup under **Payments > Products** for optimized details.

- Test how the template looks by sending yourself a preview email.

- Explore how Templates with Product Elements work inside Workflows.
