# **Super Charged SaaS Campaign**

Got an email stating that you have a reward/commission from the Super Charged SaaS Campaign? To see that reward/customer you need to "View another Campaign"

(This is also a good place to check if a customer "disappeared" from your HighLevel Affiliate Program view after upgrading)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48234500087/original/lrZ-aNFf6URPuIpCNN_DDs0Ad35thD9zVQ.png?1656024258)

## 1\. Click "View Campaign" under Supercharged SaaS Program

(These are your customers that upgraded to the 497/month also known as the SaaS plan or Pro plan. They will be moved over to this campaign.)

# Finding Commission in the Rewards tab!

Click on "Rewards" to view your earned commissions.

Commissions earned from the HighLevel $497 Proplan will be placed in the Super Charged SaaS Program Campaign. Click "View another campaign" to see those Commissions

# ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48244489599/original/STmHcDikP6ecXT-WMDdXBMFdGEqBE95BiA.png?1660156432)  FAQ

Q: I referred an existing customer to HighLevel pro. Why aren't they showing in my referrals?

A: When you refer an existing customer to HighLevel Pro they become a split customer. They will not show in your referrals because you are not the original affiliate that brought them to HighLevel. However, when they pay their subscription for Highlevel pro you will see the commission from that customer in your rewards tab along with that customer's email.

If you want to confirm that you are a split affiliate for a customer you referred to pro. Reach out to support, with the link above!
