## **What are Chat Attachments**

Chat Attachments allow visitors to include **files** with their chat messages. The widget supports **images and PDFs** and shows clear feedback while uploads are in progress. Agents receive the files in the **team inbox(** CRM conversations **)** and can preview or download them.

This is applicable only in **Live Chat Widgets(website chat).** No changes are required in the widget builder but the experience of the visitor is explained here.

* * *

## **Supported file types & limits**

- **File types:**`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.heic` (iPhone photos), `.pdf`

- **Per‑file size limit:** **up to 25 MB**

- **Per‑message limit:** **up to 5 files**

- **Preview behavior:**

  - **JPG/PNG:** small inline preview in the chat bubble and in the inbox

  - **HEIC/PDF:** shown as a filename with a download option (no inline preview)
- **Send rule:** A short **text message is required** to send attachments


* * *

## **Pre-requisites**

- Live Chat is installed on your website

- Agents have access to the **team inbox** i.e. CRM conversations


* * *

## **Uploading files (visitor side)**

**Desktop**

1. Click the **paperclip** icon in the chat composer **or** drag files from your **file explorer** into the chat.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055904013/original/ZXst3mJDzZlMeZxLLl3FBhqQ-1Y4cHhjcQ.png?1760401242)

2. Select up to **5** supported files (each **≤ 25 MB**).

3. **Type a short message** (required) and click **Send**.

**Mobile**

1. Tap the **paperclip** icon.

2. Choose **Camera** or **Gallery**.

3. Pick your file(s), **add a short message** and **Send**.


What visitors will see:

- **JPG/PNG** show a small preview directly in the conversation.

- **HEIC/PDF** appear as a file name with a download option.


* * *

## **Reviewing files (agent side)**

In the **team inbox**:

- Click **JPG/PNG** to preview or download

- Click **HEIC/PDF** to download

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055904048/original/NSaaI6xl2aapkqbk5t8wPKDRXlQzlDn5hA.png?1760401397)


**Tip**: If your browser doesn’t preview HEIC, download the file and open it locally.

* * *

## **Optional: How to allow the AI bot to respond to images**

If you use an conversation AI agent and want it to **respond to images** visitors send:

1. Go to **Settings > Labs** (sub - account tab) and enable **Respond to images**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055904055/original/cTw-bHgXQ1STiF5nxjns26Z7YIZQcFU-sA.png?1760401450)

2. Open your **AI Agent** and toggle **Allow this bot to respond to images**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055904058/original/NYFHKggKLiFd3MPRb-YC9NXcOm6-p7Jc-w.png?1760401459)


**Current limitation:** The bot can respond to **images only**. PDFs are not supported yet.

* * *

## **Best practices**

- **Keep file names clean:** use letters, numbers, hyphens/underscores; avoid repeated spaces and special symbols

- **Compress large images** before sending when on slow networks


* * *

## **FAQs**

**1\. Can visitors send more than one file?**

Yes. Up to **5 files** per message.

**2\. Why do I need to type a message?**

It keeps conversations clear and searchable; attachments require a short text.

**3\. Why don’t some files preview?**

Only **JPG/PNG** preview inline. **HEIC/PDF** appear as a downloadable file.

**4\. Can I upload files from the widget builder?**

No. Files are attached from the **visitor chat**, and agents review them in the **team inbox(** CRM Conversations **)**.

* * *

## **Troubleshooting**

- **“This file has already been attached”** : Remove the duplicate and attach a different file.

- **“This file is too big”** : Reduce to **≤ 25 MB**; consider compressing the image.

- **“This file type isn’t supported”** : Convert to JPG/PNG/HEIC/PDF.

- **Drag‑and‑drop doesn’t work** : Drag from your **file explorer** or try the paperclip picker instead.

- **Slow upload** : Large files or slow connections take longer; compress if needed.
