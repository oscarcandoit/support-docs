# **FAQs:**

## **1\. How would we know which Phone number the contact call if we have more than one Phone number?**

Go to **Conversations** \> Look up the contact > Hover over the Inbound call to click on the three dots > Click on **Details**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155031126630/original/2AqmZjuM4uOEoewZ-MmJRWWv3dxr-qhFaQ.png?1723760431)

To: You can view which Phone number the contact called here:

* * *

## **2\. How to check if the Phone number is assigned to a user?**

Once you are in the sub-account, Click **Settings** at the bottom left **:**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155031127421/original/6kMzndKB4jw5GLakQVMdkoxXJCFAqgbeLg.png?1723764448)

Click on **My Staff >**Click on **Edit** (pick any one user to edit)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155031127415/original/rc-ET-1SdKZE2c2ygOYPn8-xRs0Nkmh6Cg.png?1723764416)

Expand **Call & Voicemail Settings**

Once you click the **Select Phone Number** dropdown

- If it says **Phone number (already assigned to another user)** and you don't know which user it is, the only way to check will be to Edit each user to Expand _Call & Voicemail Settings_ section to find out which user the number is assigned to.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029906795/original/kjhWIybQJmsrIhn0jRAGmpiC6ljHxJw1Rg.jpg?1721933465)

If you see a Phone number like this, e.g. my Phone number is (778) 907-0712

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029906813/original/Emia26C6jgW0DZhauMVcayyBIwJZ3i5WRA.jpg?1721933510)

That means all calls to the assigned Phone number (778) 907-0712 will be routed to this **user's phone number**.

Even if the lead is assigned to another user, inbound calls will always always always go to the user's phone number.

Check what the user phone number is > Expand **User Info** in the first section to check the **user phone number**.

If there's no user phone number, it will fall back to the forwarding number set in phone number settings.

## **5\. How to check if 'Forward calls to business phone number' is checked or not?**

You can see this option under Sub-account view > Settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > Voice Calls > Inbound Call![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029906989/original/b_JFDrfWYl85V7RYFW8aNjrB5yxfOr6J1A.jpg?1721933851)

## **6\. If you already checked, no Phone number is assigned to the users, no forwarding number configured, the call still forwards, why?**

Please check if there's a company Phone set in

**Business Information > Company Phone**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029907025/original/0NXXOIC8KZKXvveSo80Wy07e3vqBFAQsoQ.jpg?1721933901)

## **7\. What happens if I don't configure any forwarding numbers?**

The call will drop immediately after we call the Phone number. Also number is assigned to any staff member and web/mobile app forward is enabled call will forward to web and mobile app

## **8\. Can I configure the Phone number to go to a voicemail directly?**

You can configure the [Voicemail For Company And For Users](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001146671).

One way might be to get a Google voice number with the voicemail configured and put it in the forwarding number.

Set the incoming call timeout to 1 second so it will drop the call faster in 2-3 rings.

Or you can assign the Phone number to a user and receive [Inbound Calling on Mobile APP](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001224659).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029907065/original/otHk9jsvCxqULOruojQNlj4BoqQ2_WvWTA.jpg?1721933980)

## **9\. I always want calls to forward to one number no matter what, how do I set this up?**

You can set up a new user, and assign the Phone number to the user. All the calls will always go to that user's phone number.

## **10\. When we call the Phone number, it disconnects right away, and it won't even ring, we already reset and bought a new number but it's still showing the same issue?**

Edit the Phone number and check if there are any custom values set up in the whisper message. Broken custom values will affect incoming calls and cause it to drop.

Another possible reason is that the Phone number might not be voice capable. In this article [How to check logs for a specific Call in Twilio](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001229978), it will navigate how to also check the Phone number's capabilities. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029907101/original/ichGvGlWDIfV-T6iVpK_qhAYXlxvvv3trQ.jpg?1721934040)

## **11\. Can we do call forwarding with an extension?**

Only when a Phone number is assigned to users. There’s an extension field next to user's phone number. All the calls will always go to that user's phone number.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155029907118/original/IHUO00y-GNbrPLcPsoOVRhFve1PxlMlxXQ.jpg?1721934083)

**Scenario:** A lead receives a SMS or call from a HighLevel campaign. The lead calls back the number they see on their caller ID, which is the phone number originally setup (seen in Settings -> Phone Numbers). _Where does the call go?_

1. Click Settings on the client view.
2. Click Phone Numbers.
3. Update the Call Forwarding Number of the selected default outbound number.
4. Click Save.
