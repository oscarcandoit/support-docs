# Admin Vs. User Roles and Permission Scopes

Modified on: Fri, 12 Sep, 2025 at 3:57 AM

The following is a table outlining permissions of sub-account level roles.

### **Sub-Account Level User Roles**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155018238155/original/mcE4xdl46E3pyAgBhVD9qRWDvOg8gfscqg.png?1705709137)**

## **Quick-Reference Permission Matrix.**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agency-Only** | **Sub-Account-Only** | **Available in Both** |
| Create / Edit / Delete Sub-Accounts | Pipelines & Opportunities | User Management (Admins can add/edit users within their level) |
| Manage SaaS Mode & Reselling | Workflows / Campaigns | Dashboard Reporting |
| Global Integrations (Mailgun, Twilio Rebilling, Google API, etc.) | Calendars & Appointment Settings | Media Library |
| Snapshot Management | Conversations (SMS, Email, Chat) | Audit Logs |
| Agency-Level Billing & Branding | Contact Management & Smart Lists |  |
| Agency Settings (Company Info, Rebilling Settings) | Reputation Management |  |
| White-Label Settings (Custom Domains, Logos, Colors) | Funnel & Website Builder |  |

```
Note: If a permission is not listed, assume it inherits the broader role’s default capabilities at its respective level.
```

Admins can change the role of a particular user by going to **Settings > My Staff > Edit (pencil icon) > Scroll to and expand "User Roles"** **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155018238329/original/SO6U66a5eqB-L00Pot42Kknck7OO6w0K8Q.png?1705709967)**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can an Agency Admin restrict a Sub-Account Admin from accessing certain features?**

No. Agency Admins cannot customize Sub-Account Admin role permissions directly. Sub-Account Admins always inherit full access within their assigned sub-account. To limit scope, create a _User_ role instead of an Admin role in that sub-account.

**Q. If a permission is available at both Agency and Sub-Account levels, does the Agency Admin override Sub-Account Admins?**

Yes. Agency Admins hold global authority. For permissions like user management, reporting, or media library, Agency Admin actions apply across all sub-accounts, while Sub-Account Admins manage only within their assigned sub-account.

**Q. What happens if a user is added at the Agency level and then also given access to a Sub-Account?**

The user will have **two role scopes**: agency-wide access from their Agency role, plus sub-account-specific access from their Sub-Account role. Permissions don’t cancel out—they stack, with the broader Agency permissions always taking precedence.
