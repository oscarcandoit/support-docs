## What is If Else?

If/Else lets you build advanced workflows to perform different actions based on different conditions. If/Else uses conditional logic: if A happens in your trigger app, then do X. If B happens, then do Y, and so on.

## **New Features**

1\. Duplicate branch

- Save time and effort by effortlessly copying existing branches. No need to rebuild from scratch. Click the three dots menu on a branch and choose "Duplicate Branch."
- The copied branch will appear below the original with "(copy)" added to its name. You can rename it as needed.

2\. Reorder any branch

- Organise your workflow visually by dragging and dropping branches.
- Click the "Reorder Branches" icon to reorder the branches.
- You can't reorder the "None" branch, but you can easily move all other branches.

3\. Rename None branch

- You can now name the "None" branch for better organisation.
- Just click on the branch name and type in your desired name.
- Make sure to enter a Branch Name as it can’t be left empty.
