# **What is the Invoice Notification Customization feature?**

The new feature allows businesses to customize email and SMS notifications for invoicing differently. Firstly, companies can create templates for invoicing notifications, giving them greater control over the look and feel of their notifications. Companies can customize the font, colors, and overall design to match their branding.

Secondly, businesses can include specific invoice details in their notifications. For example, companies can include the customer's name and address, the invoice total, the due date, and the invoice URL. This can help customers quickly and easily understand what they owe and when it is due, reducing the number of follow-up emails or calls.

Finally, customization can be done for the customer receiving the invoice and for the sub-account user sending the invoice. This means businesses can create different templates and notifications for other customers or sub-account users, which can be helpful for interactions with multiple customers or sub-account users.

## **Who is this feature built for?**

This feature is helpful for businesses that use invoicing to manage their financial transactions. Specifically, it benefits companies that want to control the look and feel of their invoicing notifications and customize them to match their branding. It's also helpful for businesses that want to include specific invoice details in their notifications to keep their customers informed and up-to-date.

## **What are the benefits of this feature?**

The benefits of this feature include the following:

**Customization**: Businesses can customize their invoicing notifications to match their branding, which can help to create a more professional and cohesive image.

**Exclusion of notifications:** Businesses can choose which notifications to send, which can help to reduce the number of unnecessary notifications that customers receive.

**Clarity**: By including specific invoice details in notifications, businesses can help customers quickly and easily understand what they owe and when it is due. This can reduce the number of follow-up emails or calls and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**Differentiation**: Businesses can create different templates and notifications for other customers or sub-account users, which can help to differentiate their invoicing process from competitors and improve customer loyalty.

**Efficiency**: This feature can help to streamline the invoicing process, making it easier for businesses to manage their financial transactions and reduce administrative burdens.

```
IMPORTANT: Under Customer Notifications in the Payments > Invoices & Estimates section, the "Invoice Received" and "Estimate Received" notifications are the only two that cannot be toggled off for customers. This is intentional, as these notifications are essential for ensuring that customers are informed when they receive an invoice or estimate. Both email and SMS notifications are mandatory in this case. However, similar notifications can be disabled for internal team members if needed.
```

**Please Note:**

```
Users will not be able to customize the Subject line of the Email Templates.
```

Once you are done configuring the templates for all your desired notification types, scroll down and hit **Save.**

**Please Note:**

```
The following Invoices Custom Values can be used to populate relevant information in the templates:
