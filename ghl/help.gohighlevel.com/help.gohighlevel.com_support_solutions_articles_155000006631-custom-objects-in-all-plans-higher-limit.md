# **What is a Custom Object?**

Custom Objects let you define brand-new record types (e.g., Properties, Vehicles, Policies, Patients) beyond the standard CRM entities like Contacts or Opportunities. Each object can have its own custom fields, relationships, and automations, giving you complete flexibility to model complex data inside HighLevel.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Custom Objects**

- Fits any business model—track virtually any entity or process

- Link objects to contacts or to each other with powerful many-to-many associations

- Trigger workflows, emails, texts, webhooks, and more based on object events

- Slice-and-dice data with SmartLists, Advanced Filters, and List View customization

- Maintain data integrity with detailed Audit Logs for every add, edit, or delete action

* * *

## **Plan Access & Limits**

Understand exactly what you get:

- All plans get 10 Custom Objects per location

- Records per Object are unlimited (subject to overall account storage)

- Each Object gets up to 10 unique labels between any two objects

* * *

## **Custom Object Functions**

**Associations**

Associations define how records relate (e.g., “Vehicle → Owner”). You can create one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many links and reuse them in filters, SmartLists, and workflows for crystal-clear data relationships.

**Custom Fields**

Each Custom Object supports its own custom fields—text, number, date, dropdowns, and more—so you capture exactly the data points your business relies on.

**Workflow Automation**

Trigger automation whenever a Custom Object is created, updated, or deleted. Common actions include sending notifications, updating related objects, firing webhooks, or adding rows to Google Sheets.

**SmartLists & List View**

Create shareable SmartLists, resize columns, and switch saved views to surface the exact object data your team needs. Combined with List View sorting and column selection, Custom Objects feel like a purpose-built database.

**Advanced Filters & Reporting**

Apply AND/OR logic across any object or custom field to pinpoint precise record sets—perfect for specialized reporting or one-off exports.

**Audit Logs**

Track every create, update, delete, or association change for complete data governance and accountability.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How many objects can I create?**

A: Up to 10 per sub-account across all plans.

**Q: Can I upgrade beyond 10 objects?**

A: Today the hard cap is 10. For larger requirements, submit a feature request in the HighLevel Ideas portal.

**Q: Will my existing workflows break if I add more objects?**

**Q: Who can edit or delete a Custom Object?**
