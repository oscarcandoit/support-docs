# **What is the Coupon Code Expired Workflow Trigger**

The **Coupon Code Expired** trigger fires when a coupon code reaches its scheduled expiration date and becomes inactive. It’s a great tool for marketers and sales teams to manage time-bound promotions and follow up with customers who missed out, replace expired coupons, or notify internal teams when offers are no longer active.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Coupon Code Expired Workflow Trigger**

- **Instant Alerts:** Inform sales, support, or marketing when key coupons expire so teams can react right away

- **Customer Re‑engagement:** Send follow‑up offers or extensions to shoppers who missed out, boosting conversion opportunities

- **Campaign Cleanup:** Archive tags, close opportunities, or stop ads automatically when coupon expires to keep data tidy

- **Consistent Customer Experience:** Prevent confusion by confirming that an offer is no longer valid before customers try to use it again

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: When exactly does this trigger fire?**

It fires when a coupon’s scheduled expiration date is reached and the coupon automatically becomes inactive.

**Q: Can I target specific types of coupons?**

Yes, use the _Coupon Type_ filter to target _Percentage_ or _Fixed Amount_ coupons.

**Q: What happens if I don’t apply any filters?**

The workflow will trigger for any coupon that expires. To narrow it down, apply filters like _Coupon Code Is_ or _Coupon Name Contains_.

**Q: Can I send different actions for different coupons?**

Yes, by setting up separate workflows with different _Coupon Code_ or _Coupon Type_ filters, you can run unique actions for each.

**Q: Will this trigger fire if a customer tries to redeem an already‑expired coupon?**

No. The trigger only fires when the coupon moves from active to expired status, not on failed redemption attempts.
