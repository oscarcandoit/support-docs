# **Overview of Creating and Editing Listings**

Listings are the foundation of your Rentals setup. Each listing represents a rentable item—like a car, property, or piece of equipment—and contains all associated details such as pricing, duration, and stock availability.

You can create listings quickly using the **New Listing modal** and later configure more advanced settings using the **Edit Listing page**, which includes multiple tabs for detailed customization.

* * *

## **How to Create a New Listing?**

To create a new listing:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Listings

Go to **Calendars → Calendar Settings → Rentals → Listings**.

#### **Step 2:** Create New Listing

Click the **\+ New Listing** button in the top-right corner. The **New Listing modal** will appear.

#### **Step 3:** Fill Out Basic Listing Details

In the **New Listing modal**, enter the following fields:

- **Category** — Select a category to group listings

- **Status** — Mark the listing as **Active** (visible) or **Inactive** (hidden) on the booking website.

## **Inventory & Pricing**

This section controls your stock availability, listing variations and defines how much customers pay for rentals and supports advanced pricing logic.

#### **Inventory**

- **Stock** — The total number of units available for booking.


#### **Variants**

Variants allow you to offer different versions of the same listing (e.g., multiple car types or room categories).

When variants are enabled, you can set the **Booking Unit** as Hour, Day, Week, or Month which is used across all variants.

To Add a Variant:

1. Toggle on **Variants**



**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056000657/original/jhXIcsDJNH7Dn2m7ejrARF7TmRU44rGdQw.png?1760477522)**

3. Fill in the following details:





   - **Variant Name** (e.g., Sedan, Deluxe Room)

   - **Stock** — Stock for that specific variant (if enabled).

   - **Base Price** — The price specific to that variant.

4. Click **Confirm** to save.


```
Note: Inventory and pricing are tracked individually for each variant if enabled.

## **Booking Settings**

The **Booking Settings** tab defines how customers schedule rentals and ensures smooth time-based control.

**Booking Period Type:**

- **Date & Time** **Selector**— Customers pick custom start and end times while booking.

- **Fixed Duration** — Customers choose from pre-set intervals (e.g., 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week).


```
Tip: If Time Selector is disabled in Global Settings, customers are not shown time selector(s) on the booking page.
```

**Additional Fields:**

- **Minimum Duration** — Shortest booking duration allowed.

- **Maximum Duration** — Longest permitted rental duration.

- **Pre/Post Buffer Time** — Add setup or cleaning time before and after bookings.

- **Minimum Scheduling Notice** — Required notice time before a booking can start.

- **Maximum Advance Booking Window** — The furthest date customers can book ahead.


**Example:**

For a property rental:

- Minimum Duration: 1 day

- Maximum Duration: 30 days

- Buffer: 2 hours before & after

- Advance Window: 3 months ahead

```
Note: While bookings must start and end within your business operating hours, rental durations can extend beyond them.
```

## **Calendar Sync**

The **Calendar Sync** tab allows you to sync your rental listing bookings with external calendar platforms. This prevents double-booking by automatically syncing availability between systems.

**Features:**

- **Import Calendar (iCal URL):** Add external iCal links (ending with .ics format to import bookings from third-party platforms. Imported bookings appear as blocked time slots within your Rentals calendar.

- **Export Calendar:** Generate and copy your unique iCal link to sync your Rentals availability with external platforms. This ensures that changes made in Rentals are reflected externally.


**Sync Frequency:**

Bookings from external platforms are imported automatically every 2 hours to keep availability accurate.

You can re-sync manually in between if needed using the "Refresh" action available against the imported calendar.

```
Pro Tip: Always verify iCal links before saving to ensure synchronization between Rentals and external platforms functions properly.
```

**Notes:**

1. If a listing has variants enabled, the imported calendar will block slots for all the variants.

2. If inventory is enabled for a listing, the whole inventory is blocked for the time duration for which the booking is imported.

* * *

## **Save and Publish**

Once you’ve completed setup:

1. Click **Save Changes** in the top-right corner.

2. Click **View Booking Page** to preview how the listing appears to customers.

3. Activate the listing when it’s ready to go live.


```
Tip: Test listings on your Booking Website to confirm correct pricing, durations, and synchronization behavior.
```
