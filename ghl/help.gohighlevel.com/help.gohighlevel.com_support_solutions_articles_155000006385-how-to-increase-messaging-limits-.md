# How to increase Messaging Limits?

Modified on: Tue, 23 Sep, 2025 at 7:50 AM

**Overview**

Messaging limits exist to ensure system stability, maintain compliance with carrier regulations, and protect deliverability rates. High-volume messaging, if unchecked, can trigger carrier filtering, account flagging, or even suspension due to spam concerns. By setting reasonable limits, we help safeguard both your business reputation and the overall reliability of the messaging platform.

* * *

**What's new?**

**Segment Based Limits**

1. Agencies can now choose to set custom daily/monthly messaging limits on either an SMS basis or a segment basis.
2. Previously, this configuration was only available at number of messages level and not at segments level.

* * *

**How Can You Increase Messaging Limits?**

Messaging limits control the maximum number of SMS messages that can be sent from your account per day. Adjusting these limits helps agencies manage deliverability, prevent carrier filtering, and scale communications as business needs grow. Limits can be increased either across the entire agency (affecting all sub-accounts) or for individual sub-accounts.

**1\. From the Agency Dashboard**

If you want to apply changes to all sub-accounts:

1. Go to **Agency Dashboard**.

2. Navigate to **Phone Integration Page**.

3. Select **Account Creation**.

4. Adjust the **Daily Limit** based on:

   - **Number of messages**

   - **Number of segments**

This sets the ceiling for how many messages can be sent overall.

### **2\. Increase Limits from a Specific Sub-Account**

Use this option if you only want to change the limit for one sub-account.

**Steps:**

1. Open the **desired Sub-Account**.

2. Go to the **Phone Numbers Page**.

3. Click **Advanced Settings**.

4. Find the **Message Limit** field.

5. Enter the new limit and save.


This overrides the default and applies specifically to the selected sub-account.

**Note** **-** **Agency Owner and Admins can now increase the limits**

1. Ifan agency has spent atleast 3 months and is not in trial period, they can update a sub-account's messaging limit.
2. In all other cases, agencies can reach out to our support if they want the messaging limit to be increased.

**Who Has Ownership of Increasing Messaging Limits?**

**Agency Owner and Admins can now increase the limits**

1. Ifan agency has spent atleast 3 months and is not in trial period, they can update a sub-account's messaging limit.
2. In all other cases, agencies can reach out to our support if they want the messaging limit to be increased.

* * *

**Messaging Limit Banner and Email Notification**

In case a sub-account hits their sending limit, all the users(agency/sub-account) would see a banner on the Phone Numbers page informing that the account has reached their messaging limit.

An email would also be sent to the configured emails when a sub-account has reached the limit.

## **Limitations on Increasing Messaging Limits**

While messaging limits can be increased from either the agency dashboard or the sub-account settings, there are important restrictions and risks to keep in mind:

1. **Role-Based Access**

   - Only **agency owners** and **account admins** have the authority to increase messaging limits.

   - If you need to go beyond the maximum allowed for a location, a **support ticket** must be raised for review and approval.
2. **Provider & Carrier Restrictions**

   - Even if HighLevel allows a higher limit, your messaging provider (e.g., Twilio) may still enforce their own restrictions.

   - Exceeding these thresholds could cause messages to be filtered, delayed, or blocked.
3. **Risk of Account Suspension**

   - Rapidly scaling or setting excessively high limits can trigger carrier compliance issues.

   - This increases the chance of **sub-accounts being flagged or suspended** for violating carrier policies or sending practices.
4. **Deliverability Concerns**

   - Higher limits, if not scaled responsibly, can negatively impact message deliverability.

   - Carriers may view sudden spikes in volume as spam-like behavior, reducing trust in your numbers.
