# WhatsApp Template Error: “New English (US) content can't be added while the existing English (US) content is being deleted. Try again in 4 weeks or consider creating a new message template.”

Modified on: Mon, 1 Sep, 2025 at 4:57 AM

When creating or updating a WhatsApp Message Template, you may see the following error:

**Error Message:**

_“New English (US) content can't be added while the existing English (US) content is being deleted. Try again in 4 weeks or consider creating a new message template.”_

* * *

## Why This Happens

Meta (WhatsApp) does not allow **new English (US) content to be added immediately** if the same language content is in the process of being deleted.

- Once you delete English (US) content from a template, Meta enforces a **cool-down period of up to 4 weeks** before you can add English (US) content again.

- This is part of Meta’s compliance checks to ensure consistent use of language in approved templates.


* * *

## How to Resolve

You have two options to move forward:

1. **Wait for 4 Weeks**

   - After 4 weeks from the deletion date, you can add English (US) content back to the same template name.
2. **Create a New Template** (Recommended)

   - Instead of waiting, you can create a **new template** with the required English (US) template name

   - Use a unique template name (e.g., `promo_offer_v2` instead of `promo_offer`) to ensure it passes Meta’s review.
