# How to Add Sub-Affiliates in the Affiliate Manager

Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 4:30 AM

Sub-affiliates are affiliates who work under a parent affiliate. They promote products or services through their own networks, and the parent affiliate earns a commission from the sales made by their sub-affiliates. This model helps affiliates expand their networks and increase their earnings.

Our platform supports up to 7-tier affiliate campaigns, allowing affiliates to have multiple sub-affiliates under them.

```
Please Note:
The campaign you want to add sub-affiliates to must be multi-tier (tier 2 or above).
```

## **Benefits of Sub-Affiliates**

Sub-affiliates allow for a layered commission structure. For example, if Affiliate A refers Affiliate B, and B makes a sale, both A and B earn commissions. This encourages affiliates to grow their teams and generate more leads.
