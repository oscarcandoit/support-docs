Modified on: Wed, 3 Sep, 2025 at 1:59 PM

HighLevel Labs gives users early access to new and evolving features, so you can test changes, share feedback, and prepare teams before features reach general availability. This guide explains where to find Labs, how toggles work, who can enable them, how to assign sub-accounts, and how to submit feedback.

# **What is Labs?**

Labs is HighLevel’s early-access program where selected features can be turned on before they’re released to everyone. Features in Labs may change as development continues, and your feedback helps shape final behavior and timelines. Labs includes items that apply to Agency accounts and items that apply to sub-accounts.

Understanding Labs helps you evaluate upcoming changes in a controlled way. By enabling features in a test environment, validating impact, and sending feedback, you reduce risk during rollouts and influence product direction.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Labs**

These benefits focus on how Labs improves your day-to-day operations, speeding up your ability to adopt improvements while safeguarding production sub-accounts.

- **Early Access:** Try upcoming features before general release to plan processes and training.

- **Targeted Rollout:** Enable only for selected sub-accounts to run controlled pilots.

- **Faster Feedback Loops:** Send direct feedback (with screenshots/video) to inform product improvements.

- **Change Readiness:** Update SOPs and assets ahead of General Availability to minimize disruption.

- **Risk Reduction:** Validate behavior, performance, and compatibility before enabling for all clients.

# **Agency Labs vs Sub-Account Labs**

### **Agency Labs**

- **Affects:** Agency and sub-accounts (via assignment) or specific sub-accounts you choose.

- **Who can enable:** Agency Owners/Admins.

- **Where:** Agency view → **Settings → Labs** (Agency / Sub-account tabs).

- **How it rolls out:** Toggle **ON** at Agency level → **Manage** → assign one or more sub-accounts.

- **Best for:** Central governance, controlled pilots across multiple sub-accounts, global policies/tools.


### **Sub-Account Labs**

- **Affects:** Only the current sub-account; no impact on others.

- **Who can enable:** Sub-account Admins (and Agency roles when acting inside the sub-account).

- **Where:** Sub-account view → **Settings → Labs**.

- **How it rolls out:** Toggle **ON** directly in that sub-account (no assignment needed unless required by the feature).

- **Best for:** Quick, low-risk trials; team/client-specific validation.

## **How to Interpret Labs Features**

Every Labs feature appears as a “card.” Knowing each element helps you enable features confidently and communicate timelines to stakeholders.

Each card commonly includes:

1. **Title:** Feature name.

2. **Description:** What changes or capabilities the feature provides.

3. **Live in X Days:** Estimated days until general availability (subject to change).

4. **Toggle ON/OFF:** Enable/disable the feature in the current context.

5. **Submit Feedback:** Send comments, issues, or requests directly to the product team.

**Agency Labs Exclusive**

- **Manage:** (Agency → Sub-account tab only, when applicable) – Assign the feature to specific sub-accounts.

## **How To Use Labs**

Using Labs in the correct workspace is essential. Agency view exposes Agency-level features and tools for assigning sub-account features, while sub-account view shows features you can enable locally.

### **1:** Enable an Agency‑only feature (Agency view)

1. Login to your **Agency** account **.**

2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Labs** → **Agency** **tab**.

3. Locate the feature card and review the **Description** and **Release** **Timeline**.

4. Toggle **ON**.

### **2:** Enable a Sub‑account feature via Agency assignment

```
Note: Some sub-account features must be granted by the Agency before they can be used. The Manage control lets Agency Admins/Owners choose which sub-accounts get early access.
```

1. Login to your **Agency** account.

2. Go to **Settings** → **Labs** → **Sub-account** tab.

3. Locate the feature card and review the **Description** and **Release** **Timeline**.

4. Click **Manage** and **select the sub-account(s)** to give access.

5. Click **Save**.

6. Switch to the assigned sub-account(s) and refresh the relevant area to confirm the feature appears.

### **3:** Enable a Sub‑account feature directly

Some sub-account features can be enabled directly within the sub-account without Agency assignment.

1. In the target sub-account, open **Settings** → **Labs**.

2. Find the feature card and toggle **ON**.

3. Refresh or re-open the relevant module (builder, CRM, etc.) to see changes.

To submit feedback:

1. Click on **Settings**(Agency or sub-account).
