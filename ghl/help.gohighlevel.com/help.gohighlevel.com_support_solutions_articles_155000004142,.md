# **Benefits of Using Multi-Select**

- **Efficient File Management:** You can select multiple files at once using checkmarks or by dragging the mouse across items, simplifying the handling of large numbers of files.

- **Bulk Actions:** Move, download, or delete selected files in one operation, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enter multi-select mode by dragging to select or using the “Select” option in the three-dot menu. Selected files are marked with a checkmark at the top left corner.

## **Performing Multi-Select Bulk Actions**

After selecting the files, you can move, download, or delete them in bulk by using the corresponding buttons.

```
Users can select and download up to 100 files at a time.

If a file size exceeds 2 GB, it will be skipped in multi-download and must be downloaded individually.

When in multi-select mode, the “Rename” and “Get Link” options are disabled for selected files to maintain simplicity during bulk actions.
```

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I select files across different folders using Multi-Select?**

Currently, Multi-Select allows selection within a single folder. To manage files across different folders, perform actions within each folder separately.

**Q: Are there any file types that cannot be selected using Multi-Select?**

Multi-Select supports all file types available in Media Storage. However, certain actions may be restricted based on file type. For example, some file types may not support previewing.

**Q: How does Multi-Select handle files with the same name during bulk actions?**

If you move or download multiple files with the same name, the system will prompt you to rename or skip files to prevent overwriting.

**Q: Is there a limit to the number of files I can select at once?**

You can select up to 100 files at a time for bulk actions. Attempting to select more than this limit will prompt a notification.
