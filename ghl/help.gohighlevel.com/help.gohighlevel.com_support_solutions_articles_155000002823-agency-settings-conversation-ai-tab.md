# Agency Settings - "Conversation AI" Tab

Modified on: Mon, 15 Jul, 2024 at 12:28 AM

Once Conversation AI is enabled for your agency from the "Company" tab in Agency Settings, a new "Conversation AI" tab gets added to your Agency settings. Manage the Feature and Rebilling for each Sub-account in this new tab.

**In This Article**

- [Enable/ Disable Feature](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002823-agency-settings-conversation-ai-tab#Enable/-Disable-Feature)
- [Enable/Disable Rebilling](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002823-agency-settings-conversation-ai-tab#%E2%80%8BEnable/Disable-Rebilling)

## Enable/ Disable Feature

Use the toggle, to manage the feature for each sub-account. Switching the toggle off will not let that sub-account use conversation AI and if the sub-account was already using conversation AI, it will stop any further AI generation in that subaccount

## Enable/Disable Rebilling

Use the toggle, to manage Rebilling for each sub-account. Switching the toggle off will stop Rebilling for that sub-account and the agency will have to bear the cost for that sub-account
