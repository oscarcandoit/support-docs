### **Points to Remember**

- The contacts will get enrolled even if the workflow is in Pause State.

-  Maximum allowed difference between the start and end date should not be more than 15 days.

- A Workflow should not be part of two or more date ranges that are overlapping.

- The contacts will go through the "Wait" and "If/Else" action, except these 2 the contact will be paused at the trigger or the subsequent actions.

For eg. In workflow 1 the first action is to send an Email, in this case if the workflow is "Paused" then contacts will get enrolled but will wait at the trigger until the "Pause" is ended. In workflow 2 the first action is either of "Wait" or "If/Else" in this case the contacts will get enrolled will go through the Wait or If/Else action and then pause at the subsequent action.

**Q. Can the same pause dates apply to multiple workflows?**

Once the pause period ends, workflows automatically resume. No additional action is required, provided the settings were saved correctly.
