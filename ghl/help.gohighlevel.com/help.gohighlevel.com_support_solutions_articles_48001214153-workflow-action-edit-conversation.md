Modified on: Tue, 8 Apr, 2025 at 12:14 PM

Managing conversations efficiently is crucial for any business handling customer interactions.

This eliminates manual work, streamlines workflows, and ensures that teams stay organized. In this guide, we’ll cover what this action does, its benefits, and how to configure it within workflows.

- **None:** Keeps the current read/unread status unchanged.

#### **Archive or Unarchive**

- **Archive:** Moves the conversation out of active view to keep the inbox clutter-free.
- **Unarchive:** Restores a conversation back into the Recents tab for easy access.
- **None:** Keeps the conversation in its current state.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use this action to automatically archive all completed conversations?**

Yes! By setting up a trigger like Contact Replied or Appointment Status Changed, you can automatically archive conversations once an interaction is complete.

**Q: What happens if I select “None” for both Mark as Read/Unread and Archive/Unarchive?**

If both options are set to None, the action will not make any changes to the conversation, and it will remain in its current state.

**Q: Will this action notify the user when a conversation is archived or unarchived?**

No, this action only updates the conversation’s status. If you need notifications, you can add a Send Notification action separately.

**Q: Can I bulk update conversations using this action?**

No, this action applies only to individual conversations triggered within a workflow. However, you can create workflows that apply to multiple conversations over time.
