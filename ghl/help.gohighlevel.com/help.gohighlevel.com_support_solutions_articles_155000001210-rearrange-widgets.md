## **Note:**

Wondering which plan unlocks the customizable Dashboard?

It's currently available exclusively for the $497 plan and beyond. If you're on the $97 or $297 plan, we recommend leveling up to unlock this feature.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will my widget rearrangement affect other users?**

Typically, changes apply only to your personal dashboard view. If you're an admin, you may have the option to set a global layout for all users.

**Q: What happens if I move a widget to the wrong spot?**

You can simply drag the widget again to reposition it. All changes are flexible while you're in Edit Mode and aren’t saved until you exit or save.
