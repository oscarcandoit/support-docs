## **What is Webinar Video Analytics?**

Webinar Video Analytics is a new reporting area inside HighLevel’s Site Analytics suite that visualizes attendee behavior across every webinar format—live, on-demand, and recurring. By layering time-based graphs, engagement counters, and per-session breakdowns, it turns raw viewer activity into actionable insight you can use to grow registrations and revenue.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Webinar Video Analytics**

- Pinpoint engagement peaks and drop-off moments to improve content flow.

- Compare registrations vs. actual attendance to gauge promotional effectiveness.

- Track repeat attendees in a series to spot loyal fans and high-value topics.

- Optimize scheduling with trend lines that reveal the best-performing days and times.

- Share visual reports with clients or teammates for quick, data-backed decisions.

* * *

## **On-Demand Webinar Analytics**

On-demand dashboards focus on pre-recorded sessions that prospects can watch at any time. They include:

- **Total Views:** cumulative play count.

- **Average Watch Time:** mean minutes watched per viewer.

- **Engagement Events:** Plays, Pauses, Completion %.

- **Drop-off Analysis:** the timestamp where most viewers exit, plus the % who leave there.

These metrics reveal whether your evergreen content still resonates and where to inject stronger calls-to-action.

* * *

## **Live Webinar Analytics**

Live analytics zero in on scheduled broadcasts and real-time attendance:

- **Total Registrations vs. Total Attendees**: instantly spot no-show gaps.

- **Peak Live Viewers:** highest concurrent audience (displayed on the timeline graph).

- **Engagement Spikes:** plays, pauses, and chat bursts mapped to the broadcast clock.

Use this data to refine reminder workflows and interaction moments.

* * *

## **Recurring Webinar Analytics**

Recurring analytics aggregate data across every session in a series:

- **Series Overview:** Registrations, Attendees, Repeat Attendees, Avg Attendance %, Avg Conversion %, Session Count.

- **Trend Graphs**: per-session registration and attendance lines to highlight momentum or fatigue.

This bird’s-eye view helps you choose the best cadence and topics for always-on webinar programs.

* * *

## **How To Set Up Webinar Video Analytics**

Harnessing the new dashboards takes only a few clicks, but proper setup ensures complete, accurate data.

1\. Create or import your webinar (Live, On-Demand, or Recurring) under Sites → Webinars.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055524224/original/vEZ1WGMnNmzQLv7-w8y34e2W-c68TwvXAw.png?1759929193)

```
IMPORTANT: Publish the registration pages and confirm that your form feeds into Contacts; this ties viewer activity to CRM records. Run or release your session. HighLevel automatically records every play, pause, and exit event.
```

2\. Access your analytics: Sites → Analytics → Webinars. Choose the On-Demand, Live, or Recurring tab, then pick a date range in the upper-right filter.

3\. You can also hover over any graph point to view exact counts and percentages.

4\. Use Quick Filters (e.g., device, location) to drill down without altering the underlying widget.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to add any tracking code to use Webinar Video Analytics?**

No. Tracking is native to HighLevel webinars and is enabled automatically once the webinar is published.

**Q: How soon after a webinar ends are the metrics available?**

Live webinar data populates in near-real time; final counts and completion percentages are fully processed within 10–15 minutes after the session ends.

**Q: Can I segment analytics by device type or traffic source?**

Yes. Use the Quick Filter button at the top of the dashboard to filter widgets by device, UTM source, or any custom field.

**Q: What qualifies as a “Repeat Attendee” in a series?**

Any contact that attends two or more sessions within the same recurring webinar series during the selected date range.

**Q: Will analytics track a viewer who watches the same on-demand webinar twice?**

Yes. Each playback increments Total Views, while unique contacts contribute only once to Unique Viewers.

**Q: Do you know if I can export webinar analytics?**

Click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of a widget or table and choose CSV or PDF export to share with stakeholders.

**Q: How can I trigger automations when someone reaches a certain watch percentage?**

Use the Video Tracking workflow trigger and set the percentage threshold (e.g., 50 % watched).

**Q: Do recurring webinar graphs adjust automatically when I add new sessions?**

Yes. The Series Overview and Trend Graphs update as soon as a new session’s data is collected.
