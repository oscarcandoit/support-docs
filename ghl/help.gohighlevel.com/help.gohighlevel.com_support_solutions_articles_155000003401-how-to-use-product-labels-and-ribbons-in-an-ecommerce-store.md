## **About:**

This feature will enable store owners to showcase products distinctively on product list and product details pages by allowing them to add customisable product labels or ribbons. Store owners can set a timer to the Product labels as well, post which the label goes away.

## **How to use:**

- Store owners can setup product labels/ ribbons for products in their e-commerce stores at:
Payment > Products > Enable Product label
.
- Store owners can set a optional starting and ending date and time to the product labels. Product labels can be added for every product distinctively for any time duration.

## **Notes:**

- Starting and Ending date and time will be set according to the sub-account location's time zone.
- The end date and time should be greater than start end date and time. Also, end date and time should be greater than current date and time for label to show up.

Setting up the product label:
