With this new functionality, users can now preview exactly how custom fields will appear for their respective clients before sending out any emails.This feature simplifies the testing process and eliminates the need to create fake test cases, allowing for a more efficient and cost-effective approach to email campaign management.

**Steps to preview the custom field:**

**Step 1**. Navigate to Marketing -> Email Templates to create your personalized email.

**Step 2:** Within the Email Builder, incorporate custom fields of the contact based on your preferences.
