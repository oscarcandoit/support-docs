## **Phone Number Configuration Options Explained**

### **1\. Name Your Number**

- This option lets you **label your number for internal reference**.
- **Example:** Main Sales Line, Support Line, or Agent John's Number.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057714816/original/R78Sy_8GEjwU3o6_LtTY0Q__hIuZFD90DA.png?1762424605)

### **2\. Pass Called Number As Caller ID**

- By default, the **system transmits the number of the caller for caller ID**. However, if you prefer your caller ID to **show the number that the caller dialed instead**, you can activate this feature.
- This is most relevant if the caller dialed number A and was forwarded to number B (your number).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057718221/original/7yTyiLsygGWamYS7qVjezHRUdbFqZcY0Ug.png?1762425837)

### **3\. Forward Calls To**

- Lets you define the number where **incoming calls will be routed to**. Useful for forwarding to mobile phones, external lines, or different departments.
- When a caller **dials Number A (the configured number)**, the call is **immediately forwarded to Number B (the destination number)**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057718273/original/Mlc36rjIXOuwAWyQIXBhnOh_gGd0dFXL3Q.jpeg?1762425861)

### **4\. Use Your Verified Number as Caller ID for Outbound Calls**

- This feature allows you to **show your verified phone number in the callerID of the recipient** when you are making outbound phone calls.

```
Note: This option is only applicable to Verified Phone Numbers.
```

**Checkout our guide on:**[How to Set Up Verified Caller ID (Use your number for Voice Calls)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003232)

### **5\. Call Connect**

- When enabled, the **recipient will hear a whisper message prompting them to press a key to accept the call**, ensuring that **only calls answered by a human are marked as connected**.
- Ideal for:

1. Enabling Missed-Call Text-Back automations.

2. Preventing voicemails from being falsely marked as successful calls.

### **6\. Whisper Message**

- This option allows you to set the **message that plays before connecting the call** when **Call Connect is enabled**.
- **Example:** “Call from HighLevel - press a key to connect.” or "Call from XYZ Agency - press a key to connect."

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057718611/original/VBvoiWBE2ITbCliEGcB0Qsyfvqt56QVifQ.jpeg?1762425996)

### **7\. Call Recording and Play Call Recording Message**

- The **Call Recording** option enables **automatic call recordings for training, quality assurance, or compliance purposes**.
- The **Play Call Recording Message** setting lets you **add a pre-recording whisper message,** such as “This call will be recorded for quality purposes,” to inform the receiver before recording begins.

```
Important: Call Recording costs $0.0025/min. Storing it costs $0.0005/min/month.
```

```
Note: In many U.S. states, playing a recording disclaimer is legally required to ensure compliance.
```

### **8.** **Incoming Call Timeout**

- The amount of **time (in seconds) the system lets the inbound call ring before being dropped or forwarded to a voicemail** (personal voicemail or pre-recorded voicemail within the CRM).

**A) Scenario 1:** Route to Personal Voicemail

If you want missed calls to go to your **cellphone's voicemail**, simply leave the Inbound Call Timeout field **blank** or **set it to 60 seconds**. This gives the call enough time to reach your personal voicemail system.

**B) Scenario 2:** Route to CRM Voicemail After Ringing

If you'd like the call to ring briefly before directing the lead to a **pre-recorded voicemail within the CRM**, set the Inbound Call Timeout to **around 20 seconds**. This avoids the call reaching your personal voicemail and ensures it gets handled by your CRM setup.

**C) Scenario 3:** Direct to CRM Voicemail Immediately

To send calls **directly to a pre-recorded CRM voicemail** without ringing your phone, set the Inbound Call Timeout to **1–4 seconds**.

```
Note: Make sure you’ve uploaded a voicemail recording (MP3 or WAV format) either in the Business Info tab or in the assigned user’s profile settings.
```

### **9.****Outgoing Call Timeout**

- The amount of **time (in seconds) the system lets the outbound call ring** **before dropping the call**.
- Use a shorter timeout like **30 seconds** to **avoid hitting customer voicemails,** ideal for voicemail-drop or lead-churn reduction campaigns.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057719593/original/HLMvXMJxxNw4nfB6xwZH0ZHP4DXO9bxnxw.png?1762426188)

### **10\. Ring Incoming Calls to Selected Users**

- This feature allows you to **route incoming calls to multiple users (team members) within your sub-account**.
- When a call comes in, the **phones of all selected users will ring simultaneously until someone answers or the call times out**.
- You can assign **maximum 7 users** to receive these calls, helping ensure that important calls are answered promptly, even if some team members are unavailable at the time.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I leave inbound or outbound timeout fields blank?** A:The system defaults to 60 seconds for both inbound and outbound timeouts.

**Q: What URL should I provide when verifying a toll-free number?** A:Use your official business website URL, one that customers can find and verify.

Checkout this article for more information - [Toll-Free Verification Guide for LC - Phone (US/Canada)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222300)

**Q: Can I assign the same number to multiple users?** A:Yes, under "Ring Incoming Calls to Selected Users," you can assign up to 7 users to a single number.

**Q: How do I stop forwarded calls from going to my personal voicemail?** A:Use a short inbound timeout (~20 secs) so calls hit a CRM voicemail before reaching your personal voicemail.

**Q: Why aren’t my outbound calls displaying the right caller ID?** A:Ensure that your number is verified and approved for outbound calling and you’ve selected “Use Verified Number as Caller ID.”

**Q: Can I use toll-free numbers for both SMS and voice?** A:Yes, but they must be registered and verified for SMS compliance and typically have limitations for outbound voice caller ID depending on carrier support.

Q: **Why isn’t my whisper message playing when calls are routed through my IVR workflow?**

A:Whisper messages will **only play for calls forwarded to external phone numbers**.

If the call is answered through the **HighLevel web app, mobile app, or desktop app**, the whisper message will **not** play , this is expected behavior.
