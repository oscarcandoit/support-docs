# **What is Funnels & Websites AI?**

Funnels & Websites AI is HighLevel’s next-generation page builder that uses generative AI to design funnel and website pages from a simple prompt. Choose a guided template experience (Assist), describe your own vision (Build), or chat live with the AI to refine copy, layouts, and images—while traditional builder settings remain a click away.

```
Multi-page AI generations are coming soon! For now AI generates one page at a time.
```

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Funnels & Websites AI**

- Launch pages up to 10× faster by letting AI generate copy, images, and layouts automatically.

- Eliminate guesswork with niche-specific presets that follow proven conversion practices.

- Make real-time tweaks via chat instead of hunting through menus.

- Import the look and feel of any URL or screenshot to stay on-brand instantly.

- Auto-generate SEO-friendly titles and descriptions for better search visibility.

- Keep builder controls and AI tools side-by-side for a seamless workflow.

## **Recent Enhancements**

We’ve refined the internal guidance system that powers Funnel & Website AI to ensure more **consistent, professional, and predictable** page generation. These updates improve quality without changing how you use the builder.

### **Rich Text Support Across All Text Elements**

All text fields including headings, subheadings, paragraphs, and lists—now support **rich text formatting** using HTML tags for more expressive content generation.

### **Improved Card Layout Consistency**

Card-style columns automatically apply consistent margins to prevent elements from touching, improving overall visual balance and professionalism.

### **Clearer Section Type Rules**

Navigation sections now contain only menu elements, while footers use text links instead of buttons for better accessibility and cleaner design.

### **Consistent Button Styling**

Buttons now consistently use your primary color for backgrounds, creating a unified design language across all pages.

### **Enhanced Mobile Spacing**

Mobile layouts now calculate spacing with separate horizontal and vertical margin values for improved touch targets and readability.

## **Assist Mode**

Assist Mode provides a step-by-step wizard. Select your industry, funnel goal, audience, language, tone, and preferred layout, and the AI produces a complete, editable draft—including copy, images, and color themes—so you can publish within minutes.

* * *

## **Build Mode**

Build Mode gives experienced marketers total freedom. Type exactly what you want (e.g., “three-page funnel for an orthodontist with a before-and-after gallery and consultation form”), and the AI builds the structure, sections, and placeholder content to match your description.

* * *

## **AI + Settings, Side-by-Side**

Traditional design controls (spacing, fonts, colors) remain in the right-hand sidebar, while the AI chat panel stays open on the left. You can update padding or brand colors manually, then ask the AI to rewrite copy—all without leaving the page.

* * *

## **Import from Any Link or Image**

Paste a public URL or upload an inspiration screenshot, and Funnels & Websites AI extracts the visual theme and layout to create a new HighLevel page that matches the source design.

* * *

## **SEO**

The builder auto-fills meta titles, descriptions, and image alt text with keyword-rich suggestions, giving every page a solid SEO foundation before you even click Publish.

### **Funnel AI Rebilling**

1. Navigate to Agency > Sub-Accounts.

2. Select the existing Sub-Account and click Manage.

3. Navigate to Rebilling tab > Funnel AI tab.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q Can I still edit pages manually after AI generates them?**

A Yes. All elements remain fully editable in the standard builder.
