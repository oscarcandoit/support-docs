# Enhanced Account Security

Modified on: Tue, 8 Oct, 2024 at 3:23 PM

We’ve rolled out a new security update to keep your data safer than ever!

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034345888/original/4BHSSG3Nx3UB57D_SZGBk9bU54xXrf8SRA.jpeg?1728418263)

Enabling Enhanced Account Security will:

1. Disable Auto-generation of Location API keys: To enhance account security, API keys will not be automatically generated when you create a new location via API or our user interface (UI). Instead, you will need to generate them manually through the UI.


2. Exclude API Keys in Location CRUD APIs: Previously, you could access API keys via the Location CRUD APIs responses. Going forward, you’ll need to log in and retrieve the keys directly from the UI.

3. **Disable Users APIs on API v1:** User APIs on API v1 (legacy API version) for creating, updating and deleting users will be disabled. These APIs can be used to hack into your account easily if a hacker gets hold of your API key, hence these legacy APIs pose a security risk to your account.


Please note that as of June 17th, 2024 the Enhanced Account Security setting will become the default for all accounts, unless you have opted-out in advance.

You’ll have the ability to opt-out in [Settings](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/company); however, we strongly advise against it as it will put your account and data at risk.
