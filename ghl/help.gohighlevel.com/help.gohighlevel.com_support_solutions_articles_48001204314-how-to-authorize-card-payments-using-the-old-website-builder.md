## **How Authorization works:**

- This is **not** turned on by default  and will require a couple of quick extra steps, covered below
- The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorized amount" from the client's bank account before crediting it back later.
- If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
- Upon authorization approval, the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
- If you have any " **Trial days**" attached to the plan, those will kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
- Funds may take up to 5 business days before being returned to the client's bank account
- It **ONLY** works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.

**Please Note:**

```
If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.
```

**1\. Head into the website and find the step where the order form is placed**

Click on the **"3 dots".**

![Click on highlight](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170360364/original/cNMaC-p9WFR_LaNAtbqNMymeR_QBauQtdw.png?1639435447)

**2\. Click on "Products"**

If you are not seeing any products attached to your page, you will need add them first before continuing.

![Click on "Products"](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170360366/original/_Fn5Lzm-A0GcGIMaYwngVWh00Hp2qgndtw.png?1639435447)

**2\. Click on the "Edit" icon**

This will open the product settings. In this example, there are two plans (monthly $149 & Annual $1490) where "Authorization" will need to be turned on.

First, we will start with plan 1 (monthly $149), then come back and repeat this process for plan 2 (Annual plan $1490).

![Click on "Edit" icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170360465/original/4NiKSkt3B81dw8dknWwHAD5nKaBlKERxqw.png?1639435477)

**4\. Click on Authorize Card**

![Click on Authorize Card](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170360467/original/SS4Zt7VbCJqI0cYo1CaNOEkrb_f5L1QBNQ.png?1639435478)

**5\. Type the dollar amount you would like to "authorize"**

**Please Note:**

```
Keep in mind the amount you place here will be deducted from the clients account. If the funds are unavailable they will not be able to proceed.

In this example: The system will take "$1" out of the clients account and then refund the "$1" back.

The refund process may take up to 5 business days before returning the amount taken. Only works with subscription and payment plans
```

![Type the dollar amount you would like to "authorize"](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48172058669/original/2TylRONBkqsiYk9Y-WolQjjADwEXTTEcbA.png?1639781682)

**6\. Click on "Currency"**

Enter the currency you wish to use

![Click on "Currency"](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48172058694/original/02uEUg5tzFbTLN7qVrea5_EgRVGw6GeynA.png?1639781713)

**7\. Click on USD**

For this example, we will use USD.
