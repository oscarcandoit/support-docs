# **What is Ad Manager?**

Ad Manager brings **Facebook, Instagram, Google, and LinkedIn** Ads together into one easy-to-use dashboard.

Instead of switching between different ad platforms, users can create campaigns, track performance, and optimize results — directly within HighLevel. This saves time, reduces complexity, and makes professional advertising accessible for businesses of all sizes.

Ad Manager enables both agencies and sub-accounts to run high-performing campaigns and analyze performance without leaving the HighLevel platform.

## **Supported Platforms and Campaign Types**

Ad Manager supports multiple platforms and ad types. The table below outlines what objectives and formats are available on each platform.
