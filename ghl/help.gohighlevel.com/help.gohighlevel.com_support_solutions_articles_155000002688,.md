This action keeps your contact data current, accurate, and aligned with customer interactions.

## **Key Benefits of Using This Action**

2. **Enhanced Personalization:** Use updated contact details to deliver more personalized and targeted communication.

## **Configuring Update Contact Field Action: Step-by-Step Process**

Go to the **"Automation"** section of your CRM. Click **"Workflows"** menu located at the top.

Open the workflow editor and select the workflow where you want to add the “Update Contact Field” action. Else, you can simply start building your own workflow from scratch. Just click **"\+ Create Workflow"** button and select **"\+ Start from scratch"** option from the dropdown menu.

Give your action a clear, descriptive name (e.g., “Update Contact Address”). This makes it easier to identify in the workflow.

Action types give you the ability to 1. Clear the existing information and 2. Update the information. In real world, you can set the workflow to first clear the existing information from the contact record and then replace it with the new information.
