# Bulk Eject Sub-Accounts

Modified on: Wed, 17 Sep, 2025 at 3:48 PM

The **Bulk Eject** feature allows agency owners to transfer multiple sub-accounts into new HighLevel agency accounts in a single, streamlined process. This saves time, reduces manual work, and ensures that agencies can continue earning affiliate commissions on subscriptions tied to those accounts. Whether scaling operations, offboarding clients, or helping incubate new agencies, Bulk Eject makes the process efficient and transparent.

### **Step 2: Nominee Accepts the Request**

- Each nominee will receive an email invitation from the releasing agency.

- The nominee must accept the request and will be redirected to the HighLevel app.


### **Step 3: Nominee Creates Their Agency**

- After logging in, nominees will provide basic details for their new agency (agency name, phone number, billing address, etc.).

- Once completed, the new agency inherits the original sub-account, including assets and users.


## **Affiliate Commissions**

- The releasing agency automatically becomes the affiliate for each new agency created.

- Commissions are recurring and tied to the subscriptions of the new agencies.


## **Notes**

- Only agency owners can access and perform bulk eject actions.

- Sub-accounts can be transferred either by manual selection or CSV upload.
