When creating new sub-accounts, certain settings are pre-applied to streamline the setup process. These settings ensure that sub-accounts are configured optimally from the start, reducing manual adjustments. However, users can modify them at any time to better suit their operations.

## **Understanding Default Preferences**

### **1\. Automatically Link Phone System**

✅ Pre-enabled by default

This setting ensures that new sub-accounts are automatically connected to the phone system. It provides instant access to messaging and voice services, eliminating the need for manual setup.

### **2\. Allow Sub-Account Users to Submit A2P Registration if Re-Billing is Disabled**

By default, sub-accounts can only submit A2P (Application-to-Person) registration if re-billing is enabled. Enabling this option allows users to submit A2P registration even when re-billing is disabled. (Optional setting)

### **3\. Automatically Enable Number Intelligence**

This feature provides enhanced phone number intelligence by:

- Validating numbers before sending the first SMS

- Detecting incoming spam calls

- Looking up the names of unknown callers before answering

Enabling this setting improves the efficiency and reliability of phone communication. (Optional setting)

### **4\. Messaging Limit**

The **Messaging Limit** applies to all newly created sub-accounts. The selected limit determines the messaging capacity for new sub-accounts, ensuring compliance with usage policies.

- **Current Limit:** Messaging Ramp (default setting)

- Users can modify this setting as needed.
