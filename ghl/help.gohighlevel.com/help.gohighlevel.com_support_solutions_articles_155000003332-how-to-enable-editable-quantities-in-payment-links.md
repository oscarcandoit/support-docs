## **What's New?**

- We’ve added a new feature that lets your customers edit product quantities directly on the payment links you send them.
- This means they can adjust the number of items they want to buy before they complete their purchase.

## **How to Use?**

- When you’re creating a payment link, you’ll now see an option to allow "Let customers adjust quantities."
- Check the box
- Set minimum and maximum quantities

- Share the payment link as you normally would.
- Users can then edit the quantity and then pay the total amount.

## **Why We Built It?**

- We know that flexibility is key to a great shopping experience. By letting customers adjust quantities on the spot, we’re making it easier for them to get exactly what they need.
- Plus, it’s something our users have been asking for, and we’re always listening to your feedback!
