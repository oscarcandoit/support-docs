## **What is the New Affiliate Sales Trigger?**

The New Affiliate Sale trigger fires every time an affiliate successfully makes a sale—whether it's a one-time, recurring, or manually tracked transaction.

You can use it to:

- Congratulate affiliates
- Notify customers
- Assign tasks
- Segment contacts
- And more—automatically

## **Filters available**

You now get extra control with these filters:

- ? Affiliate filter – Target specific affiliates
- ? Campaign filter – Trigger actions for sales from selected campaigns
- ✅ Payout method check – Trigger only if the affiliate has (or has not) added a payout method
- ? Tax form check – Trigger based on whether the affiliate has submitted tax forms

* * *

## **How to Set It Up**

To use the Affiliate Sales Trigger within your workflows:

1. Go to Automations > Workflows
2. Click Create New Workflow or open an existing one
3. Add a trigger: search for **New Affiliate Sale**
4. Apply optional filters (affiliate, campaign, payout method, tax form)
5. Add actions (email, SMS, task, tag, etc.)
6. Click Save![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047636568/original/taqSqiwUq88uHxi55u0WxliJelpRCrv8mA.png?1748934541)
