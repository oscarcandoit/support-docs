# **What is Deleting and Restoring Opportunities/Pipelines?**

Opportunities are individual deals or clients within a pipeline, and pipelines are the frameworks that structure your sales process.Deleting an opportunity removes it from the active pipeline. Once an opportunity is deleted, it is no longer visible in the active opportunities list, but its data is retained in the system and can be restored if needed for **upto 60 days**.

This allows users to declutter their pipeline by removing outdated or irrelevant opportunities while preserving the option to recover them later if necessary.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Deleting and Restoring Pipelines & Opportunities**

This functionality provides confidence and control when managing your CRM.

- **Accidental Deletion Recovery**: Restore pipelines and opportunities easily within 60 days.

- **Integrated Audit Logs**: Track changes and recover deleted items with full visibility.

- **Admin Permissions**: Only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like deletion and restoration.

- **Full Pipeline Recovery**: Restores include stages and opportunities tied to deleted pipelines.

- **Decluttered Workflow**: Clean up your opportunity list or pipeline structure as needed.
