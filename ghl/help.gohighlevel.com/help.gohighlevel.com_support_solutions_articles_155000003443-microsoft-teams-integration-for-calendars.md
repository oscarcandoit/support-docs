### **Important Notes**

- ### Connecting an Outlook calendar does not automatically link Microsoft Teams. To connect Teams, navigate to **Calendar Connections > Video Conferencing** and connect it separately.

- To view appointments on your Outlook calendar, ensure that your desired Outlook calendar is both connected and selected as the linked calendar. You can do this under **Calendar Connections > Calendars**.

### **Limitations with Microsoft Teams Integration**

- Only Microsoft Teams accounts for Work and School (Organisation and Education) are eligible for integration.
- Each user can connect only one Microsoft Teams integration per subaccount.

A: **Personal Booking**, **Round Robin**, **Collective Calendars, and Service Calendars** support Microsoft Teams integration and automatically generate new Teams links for each appointment booked. This feature is coming soon for Class Booking Calendars.

**Q: How Can I Use Microsoft Teams with Event Calendars?**

A: You can use Microsoft Teams with **Event Calendars** by manually generating a Teams meeting link and adding it to the calendar settings.

**Steps:**

2. In the calendar settings, select **Custom** as the meeting location.
