# **What is Trigger Link in** **WhatsApp Templates** **?**

WhatsApp Templates Trigger Link Support lets you place **tracked, automation-ready CTAs** in WhatsApp V2 templates. When a contact taps a Trigger Link (as a **button** or **inline link**), HighLevel records the click so your workflows can branch immediately—similar to Trigger Links in email and SMS—enabling targeted offers, timely reminders, and measurable engagement.

- **Works with:** WhatsApp **V2** sending action inside **Workflows**

- **Tracks:** Which CTA/link a contact tapped

- **Automates:** Branches on **Trigger Link Clicked**, sends follow-ups, sets tags, updates fields, etc.

- **Design options:** **Trigger Link Button (recommended)** or **Inline Trigger Link** in the body text


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Trigger Link in WhatsApp Templates**

These benefits help you decide when to use Trigger Links and how to structure templates for the best conversion and clean analytics.

- **Click-level attribution**: See exactly which CTA a contact tapped for precise routing.

- **Smarter automation**: **Branch workflows** on the clicked link and send tailored next steps.

- **Faster testing**: Run controlled A/Bs on button labels or link destinations to improve conversion.

- **Clean handoffs**: Use tags/fields from clicks to personalize sales or service follow-ups.

- **No extra tools**: Track natively in HighLevel—no external tracking required.


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

Confirm access and approvals first so your templates send and track correctly.

- Active **WhatsApp** connection (HighLevel WhatsApp subscription) and completed **Meta onboarding**

- Sub-account access with permission to create **Templates** and edit **Workflows**

- One or more **Trigger Links** created (Marketing → **Trigger Links** → **Links**)

- Approved or approvable **WhatsApp V2** templates (category, sample content, and variables filled correctly)


* * *

## **WhatsApp Trigger Link Options (Choose One or Use Both)**

You can place tracked CTAs as **buttons** or **inline links**. Buttons are cleaner and easier to tap; inline links are useful when your copy needs a sentence-level link.

- **Trigger Link Button (recommended):** Add a button whose type is **Trigger Link** and map it to your link.

- **Inline Trigger Link (body text):** Insert a variable and map it to a Trigger Link; the link appears inside the message body.


* * *

## **Button Limits & Design Guidelines**

Keep CTAs clear and compliant to maximize clicks and prevent confusion.

- **Limit:** Total buttons per message **≤ 2** (Trigger Link buttons + normal buttons).

- Prefer **1–2 focused CTAs** to reduce choice overload.

- Use descriptive labels (e.g., “See Pricing,” “Book Pickup”) that map cleanly to workflow branches.

- Provide **sample content** for variables during template creation to streamline Meta approval.

- If sending a **follow-up** template later (no reply yet), prepare/approve that template in advance.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need integrations to track button clicks?**

No. Trigger Links are tracked natively in HighLevel and can power workflow branches.

**Q: What’s the difference between a Trigger Link button and an inline Trigger Link?**

**Buttons** are cleaner and easier to tap; **inline links** live in the body text. Both track clicks and can trigger workflow branches.

**Q: How many buttons can I use in one message?**

The combined total of Trigger Link buttons and normal buttons is **two**.

**Q: Can I follow up if the contact hasn’t replied yet?**

Yes, but use an **approved template** for outbound messages that fall outside a reply window.

**Q: How do I know which CTA performed best?**

Use **Template Analytics** and **Workflow History** to compare button/link clicks and downstream conversions.

**Q: Can I personalize the template (e.g., first name)?**

Yes. Insert variables and include **sample content** for Meta approval; the variable will render per contact at send time.
