# How to create a user or admin to manage multiple HL locations without giving them agency access?

Modified on: Wed, 21 May, 2025 at 8:41 AM

This article explains how to create or update users at the account level so they can manage multiple HighLevel sub-accounts without being granted access to the agency dashboard. You'll learn how to assign the correct role, configure access settings, and manage permissions using the updated HighLevel interface.

# **What is the Account User/Admin Role?**

Account-level users and admins are restricted to selected sub-accounts. Unlike agency-level users, they do not have visibility or control over the entire agency. This setup is ideal for giving team members access to multiple locations without compromising sensitive agency-wide settings.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Account-Level Access**

- Granular Permissions: Limit access to only the locations they need.
- Secure Delegation: Avoid giving unnecessary agency-wide visibility.
- Flexible Management: Add users as Admins or Users based on required capabilities.

* * *

## **Configuring Account-Level Users and Admins**

### **Switch to Agency View**

Click the location dropdown in the top left of your dashboard, then select Switch to Agency View.

### **Set User Type to Account**

Under Roles and Permissions, set the User Type to Account. This ensures the user has no agency-level access.

### **Assign User Role and Locations**

- Choose between User or Admin under User Role.
- Use the search field to assign one or more sub-accounts the user should have access to.
- Configure feature-specific permissions as needed using the toggle switches.

### **Save the User**

Once you’ve configured the access settings, click **Save** to complete the setup.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can one user manage more than one location?**Yes. When assigning sub-account access, you can select multiple locations.

**Q: What’s the difference between Account User and Account Admin?**Account Admins can manage most settings within assigned sub-accounts, while Users typically have restricted access based on toggled permissions.

**Q: Can I promote an existing account user to admin later?**Yes. Edit the user under Settings > Team, and update their role from User to Admin.

**Q: Can an Account user access the Agency Dashboard?**No. Setting the User Type to Account ensures the user cannot access the agency-level interface.

**Q: Will the user receive an invite email?**Yes. Once saved, an invitation is sent to the user’s email to join and access the assigned sub-accounts.
