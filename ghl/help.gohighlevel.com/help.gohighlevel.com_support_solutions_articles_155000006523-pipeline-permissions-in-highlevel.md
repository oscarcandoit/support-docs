## **What are Pipeline Permissions?**

Pipeline Permissions adds role-based access control to the Opportunities > Pipelines area. Admins can decide which users or roles may view, edit, or have no access to each individual pipeline. This granular visibility keeps data secure and lets sales teams focus only on the deals that matter to them.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Pipeline Permissions**

- Protect sensitive revenue data by hiding entire pipelines from unauthorized users.

- Eliminate “pipeline clutter” so reps only work the opportunities relevant to them.

- Maintain CRM consistency—permissions apply across web app, mobile app, and API.

- Meet compliance requirements with a full audit trail of every permission change.

* * *

## **Sharing Modes**

Three flexible ways to share each pipeline let you mirror any org structure.

- Use the lock-icon “ **Manage Permissions**” button beside any pipeline to select the best mode.

- **Share with all users** – grant everyone View Only or Edit access in one click.

- **Share with selected users** – pick individual users/roles and set View, Edit, or No Access for each.

- **Exclude specific users** – keep the pipeline global, then remove access for a few exceptions.

## **Access Levels**

Clear labels make it obvious what each person can do.

- **View Only** – move and update opportunities, but cannot add/edit/delete stages or pipelines.

- **Edit** – full control to add, edit, and delete pipeline stages (including the pipeline itself).

- **No Access** – the pipeline is completely hidden in web, mobile, and API responses.


* * *

## **Audit Logs & Safeguards**

HighLevel automatically logs every create, update, or revoke action with user, pipeline, action, and timestamp for 60 days. This audit trail simplifies troubleshooting and compliance reviews.

Navigate to **Settings → Audit Logs** and filter by **Pipeline Permissions** to view who changed what, and when.

The system also prevents you from revoking access from anyone who currently owns opportunities in that pipeline—You’ll be prompted to reassign ownership first.

## **Copy Link Sharing**

Need to point a teammate to a specific pipeline fast? Use the “Copy Link” option in the Manage Permissions panel. The generated URL opens directly to the chosen pipeline view, honoring whatever access that user has.

## **How to Access Pipeline Permissions**

Follow these steps the first time you lock down a pipeline.

1. Navigate to **Opportunities → Pipelines**.

2. Find the pipeline you want to configure.

3. Click the **“Manage Permissions”** icon (lock icon).

4. The **Sharing & Permissions** panel will open on the right side of your screen.

## Sharing Options

Inside the **Sharing & Permissions** panel, you’ll find three options:

1. **Share with all users**

   - Default setting, applies to everyone.

   - You can set the default to _View Only_ or _Edit_.
2. **Share with selected users**

   - Choose specific users or roles and assign them View, Edit, or No Access.

   - Add users via the **Select Users** dropdown.

3. **Exclude specific users**

   - Hide the pipeline from selected users.

   - Useful when most of your team needs access, but you want to restrict a few.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the difference between “View Only” and “No Access”?**

View-only users can still move or update their assigned opportunities inside the pipeline. No Access hides the pipeline completely.

**Q: What if a user already owns opportunities and I set them to No Access?**

High-level blocks that change. Reassign or delete their opportunities first, then remove access.

**Q: Do permissions sync to the mobile app?**

Yes. The same rules apply across web, iOS, Android, and all API responses.

**Q: Can I bulk-assign permissions to a role instead of each user?**

Yes—roles appear in the selector. Everyone in that role inherits the chosen level.

**Q: Will permission changes break active automations or webhooks?**

No. Automations continue to run. However, API calls made with a user token that lacks access will return an empty pipeline list.

**Q: Is there an “Owner Only” option?**

Use “Share with selected users” ➜ choose the owner ➜ set others to No Access for a true owner-only pipeline.

**Q: How long are Audit Logs retained?**

60 days of history are available for download or review.
