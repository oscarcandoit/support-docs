# Collaborator Posts support for Instagram

Modified on: Thu, 3 Apr, 2025 at 11:25 AM

This article will walk you through how to create Instagram Collaborator Posts directly from HighLevel’s Social Planner!

# **What is an Instagram Collaborator Post?**

Instagram Collaborator Posts (Collab Posts) allow two accounts to share the same post in their feed or Reels. This joint-posting feature increases visibility and engagement by showing the content to both users’ audiences, making it perfect for partnerships, influencer campaigns, or brand collaborations.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Instagram Collab Posts**

Collab posts boost your organic reach while streamlining brand partnerships.

    •    Post simultaneously to two Instagram accounts with one upload.

    •    Expand reach to both sets of followers.

    •    Drive higher engagement and community growth.

    •    Simplify influencer campaigns and co-marketing strategies.

    •    Collaborator approval is handled natively on Instagram, reducing friction.

    •    Available for both Feed and Reels post types.

* * *

## **How To Use Instagram Collaborator Posts in Social Planner**

Learn how to set up and schedule Instagram Collab posts using HighLevel’s Social Planner so they appear on both your account and your collaborator’s.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

    1\.    **Go to Marketing → Social Planner**

Navigate to the left-hand menu and click **Marketing**, then select **Social Planner**.

    2\.    **Connect Your Instagram Account**

Click the **gear icon** next to “New Post” to open Social Planner Settings.

If your Instagram account isn’t connected yet, click **Add Account** and complete the connection process.

    3\.    **Click “New Post” to Create Content**

    •    Select your Instagram profile from the list of connected accounts.

    •    Add your caption, hashtags, location, and any images or videos for the post.

    4\.    **Choose Post Type: Feed or Reel**

For Collaborator posts to work, the content **must be posted as a Feed or Reel**.

Use the dropdown menu to select the correct post format.

    5\.    **Add a Collaborator**

Scroll to the **Collaborator** section and enter the **exact Instagram handle** of the person or brand you wish to collaborate with (e.g., @partneraccount).

    6\.    **Schedule or Publish Your Post**

    •    Choose a publish date and time, or click **Post Now**.

    •    Once live, your collaborator will receive a notification on Instagram to accept the invite.

    •    After accepting, the post will appear on both accounts’ feeds or Reels tabs.

## **Instagram Collaborator Post Settings**

To ensure your collaborator posts go live without issues, follow these requirements:

    •    **Post Type Requirement:** Only **Feed** and **Reels** support collaboration — Stories and Carousels are not supported.

    •    **Correct Instagram Handle:** Enter the handle exactly as it appears. Invalid handles will result in failure to invite.

    •    **No Pre-Approval in HighLevel:** Collaborator invites are managed entirely on Instagram, after the post is published.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I tag multiple collaborators in one post?**

A: No, Instagram currently allows only **one collaborator** per post using the Collab feature.

**Q: What happens if the collaborator doesn’t accept the invite?**

A: The post will still appear on your Instagram profile, but will not be visible on the collaborator’s profile unless they accept the collaboration request.

**Q: Can I schedule a Collaborator post in advance?**

A: Yes! Collaborator posts can be scheduled just like any other Instagram post in Social Planner. The collaborator will be notified when it goes live.

**Q: Does the collaborator need to be connected in Social Planner?**

A: No. The collaborator only needs to have a valid Instagram handle. The collaboration happens natively on Instagram after the post is published.

**Q: Can I edit the collaborator after posting?**

A: No. The collaborator must be set **before** publishing. You cannot modify collaborators after the post is live.

**Q: Does this work for Instagram Business and Creator accounts?**

A: Yes. Both account types support the Collaborator feature as long as they’re eligible for Collab posts on Instagram.
