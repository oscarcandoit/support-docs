## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:** **How do I revert changes if I don’t like them?**

If you’d like to undo a change, you can go back to the template editor and either restore a previous version of the template or manually adjust your edits.

**Q:******Can I pre** view my email changes before sending?**

Yes! You can preview your email changes before applying them using test email or preview feature of email builder

**Q:** **If I create a custom template would the settings work?**

If you are using the custom values to add logos or button color from the custom value option we provide in the builder then the settings would work.
