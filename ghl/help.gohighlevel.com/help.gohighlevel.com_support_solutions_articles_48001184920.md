## **What is SAAS?**

SaaS stands for "Software-as-a-Service." It is a delivery model for software applications where the software is hosted in the cloud and provided to users over the Internet on a subscription basis. With SaaS, users can access the software and its features through a web browser without installing or maintaining any software locally on their computer or device. SaaS has become a popular model for software delivery as it offers benefits such as easy scalability, automatic updates, lower upfront costs, and greater accessibility. Many popular software solutions, including email marketing platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and project management tools, are provided as SaaS offerings.

# **Troubleshooting**

### **What happens when someone signs up?**

When a SaaS Subscription is sold (meaning someone signs up for one of your plans that was created via the SaaS Configurator via a 2-Step order form), the following occurs:

- A location/sub-account is created using the First & Last Name entered into the 2-Step Order Form as the Location Name
- A User is created using the First Name, Last Name, and Email entered into the 2-Step Order Form, and a password is generated.
- Location permissions are applied to the sub-account based on the feature set of the purchased plan in the SaaS Configurator.
- SaaS Mode is enabled for the sub-account
- Twilio Rebilling is enabled for the sub-account according to the Rebilling settings in the SaaS Configurator.
- An email is sent from your default Mailgun sending subdomain to the user that was created containing the username & password (if you don't have your own Mailgun configured, the Email is sent from replies.leadconnectorhq.com)

### **Can clients control their rebilling settings?**

Yes, clients can view their current credit balance and all usage/charges and configure their re-charge settings by going to Settings > Company Billing.

### **Can I sell SaaS Mode in a different currency?**

Yes, you need to create your SaaS plans like usual, go into Stripe, edit the Product price, change the currency, then manually edit the Product settings in your funnel/website sales page. and

**Please Note:**

```
This edit cannot be made after the product has an active subscription.
The Twilio rebilling will still function in US dollars.
```

### **Why is my subaccount not created when purchasing on the SaaS funnel?**

SaaS subaccount will not be created in the following cases:

- The price purchased is not a SaaS price (the price must be located inside the SaaS product made in Stripe)
- Purchase is in Test mode
- Purchase is not in Stripe (using PayPal instead)
- The Email used for purchase already has an account associated with it (use a different email for purchasing a new subaccount)

### **Can I use SaaS Mode just for Twilio Rebilling (no plans)?**

Yes, you can manually activate SaaS Mode for any existing sub-account by going to your Agency Account > Sub-Accounts tab, scrolling to the sub-account, clicking the three-dot icon to the right of the sub-account, and selecting "Switch To SaaS."

### **What about Tax?**

If you have customers who have already purchased, log into Stripe and go to Products > Tax Rates, where you can add Tax ("inclusive" means your agency will cover the Tax - "exclusive" means the Customer will pay Tax on top of the plan price). After you create the Tax rate, copy the Tax Rate ID, go to the Customer> edit subscription, Add Tax, and select the rate you made. ( [Use Stripe Checkout Pages](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001187056))

For new customers moving forward, you can dynamically calculate and apply accurate taxes in real-time by using a third-party Stripe integration, which you can find here: https://stripe.com/partners/apps-and-extensions/tax-calculation

### **How can I add my products/services to SaaS Products?**

Your customers only ever see what's on the sales page, so add the corresponding sales copy to your sales page, include whatever is needed for the product/service in your snapshot, and configure your price.

### **How can I change the price of SaaS Mode for a specific client?**

Log into Stripe, find the Customer, and edit their subscription.

### **Can I change the permissions of an existing SaaS Mode sub-account?**

Yes, to do so:

1. Go to your Agency Account > Sub-Accounts tab
2. Click the "Manage Client" link on the right side of the sub-account/location you want to adjust permissions for
3. Scroll to the "Enable/Disable Products" section to toggle on/off features.
