# **What is Remove** **Assigned User**

The Remove Assigned User action is designed to unassign a CRM user from a contact, effectively leaving the contact unassigned. This action is particularly useful when a contact’s status or workflow criteria change, and they no longer need direct user assignment. By removing the assigned user, the contact can re-enter other workflows or remain unallocated for future processing.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using This Workflow Action**

- **Reset Contact Assignment:** Clears user assignments to reset the contact for re-engagement or reassignment.

- **Automated Workflow Management:** Seamlessly removes user assignments when specific triggers (like task completion or status changes) occur, eliminating manual intervention.

- **Improved User Availability:** Frees up users by removing contacts that no longer require their direct attention.

- **Enhanced Workflow Flexibility:** Allows contacts to move between workflows without conflicting or outdated assignments.

* * *

## **Configuring the Action: A Step-by-Step Process**

In your workflow builder, click the **“+”** icon to add a new action.

### **Save the Action**

There are no additional fields to configure, so once the name is set, **"Save"** the action.

### **Test and Publish**

Test your workflow to ensure it removes assignments as intended, and enable the **"Publish"** toggle to activate it.

## **Use Cases**

### **Sales Pipeline Cleanup**

**Scenario:** A contact’s opportunity status changes to “Closed Won” or “Closed Lost.” The sales team no longer needs to follow up, and the contact should be reset for other workflows.

**Solution:**

- **Trigger:** Opportunity Status Changed

- **Action:** Remove Assigned User.

- **Outcome:** The contact is unassigned from the salesperson, freeing them to focus on active opportunities.

### **Task Completion in Customer Support**

**Scenario:** A support agent completes a task related to a contact, such as resolving a ticket. Once the task is done, the contact no longer requires direct assignment.

**Solution:**

- **Trigger:** Task Completed.

- **Action**: Remove Assigned User.

- **Outcome:** The agent is unassigned, allowing them to handle new support tickets efficiently.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**What happens to a contact after the assigned user is removed?**

Once the assigned user is removed, the contact becomes unassigned and remains in the system without an active user assignment. It can then be reassigned through other workflows or triggers.

**Can this action be combined with multiple triggers in a single workflow?**

Yes, you can combine the Remove Assigned User action with multiple triggers, such as “Task Completed” and “Opportunity Status Changed,” to create complex workflows that dynamically manage contact assignments.

**Will this action remove the assignment history?**

No, removing an assigned user does not erase the contact’s assignment history. You can still track previous user assignments through activity logs or reporting tools.

**How do I ensure this action doesn’t interrupt other workflows?**

To prevent conflicts, test the workflow before publishing it and review conditions for all triggers carefully. Ensure the Remove Assigned User action is only applied where necessary.

**Can I reassign a contact immediately after using the Remove Assigned User action?**

Yes, after removing the current assignment, you can add a follow-up action in the workflow to reassign the contact to a new user using the “Assign to User” action.
