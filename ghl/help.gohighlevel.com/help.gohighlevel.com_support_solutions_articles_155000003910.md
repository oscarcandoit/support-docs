## Action 1 - Customizing the Opportunity Card

#### **1\. Accessing the Opportunity Card Customization:**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034966768/original/Pf_YMQ_LbnuimXO2sFfoPFvDe7Qjz1gL4Q.jpeg?1729252722)**

- Navigate to **Opportunities** section.
- Click the **Manage Fields option** (found in the top-right corner of the opportunity board).

#### **2\. Selecting Fields to Display:**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034966760/original/whrAEzcNjJ804SsmgmasKwxxtLxL1bq5Gg.jpeg?1729252715)**

You can choose up to **7 fields** to display on your Opportunity Cards. These fields include:

- **Opportunity Standard Fields:**

  - Opportunity Name
  - Opportunity Status
  - Lost Reason
  - Opportunity Value
  - Opportunity Owner
  - Opportunity Source
- **Opportunity Custom Fields:**

  - Any opportunity custom fields you’ve created.

```
Note: The fields and folders you see when customizing Opportunity cards come from your Custom Fields. If folders like General Info or Additional Info are missing, it means they haven't been set up yet. Click here to learn how to make Custom Fields
```

- **Primary Contact's Information:**

  - Contact Name
  - Contact Phone Number
  - Contact Email Address
  - Contact Business Name
  - **Next Task Due Date**
  - **Days Till Next Task Due Date**
  - **Days Till Next Appointment Date**
  - **Engagement Score**

```
Engagement Score will be visible only for opportunities created or updated post 19th March 2025.
```

- **Opportunity Activity:**
  - Created On
  - Updated On
  - Last Stage Change Date
  - Last Status Change Date
  - **Days Since Last Stage Change Date**
  - **Days Since Last Status Change Date**
  - **Days Since Last Updated**

#### **3\. Customizing Counters at the Bottom of the Card:**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034966743/original/6gZVsKjAPOYe2BvRxpozZRiiWdGaVlD2YQ.jpeg?1729252706)**

**You can also customize the counters and icons at the bottom of the Opportunity Card by moving to the "Quick Actions" tab. The available options include:**

- **Conversations Icon (with unread messages count)**
- **Task Icon (with task count)**
- **Note Icon (with note count)**
- **Tags Icon (with tag count)**
- **Call Icon**
- **Appointment Icon (with next appointment date)**

```
When you export opportunities from the customized view, the export will include all fields of the opportunity, not just the ones visible on the card
```

## **Feature 2 - Customizing for Multiple Pipelines**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034966728/original/Nk84MSDUQqHusKTwnH7Od5stwyK8Hq6YEA.png?1729252697)**

- **Customizations are applied per pipeline by default. However, if there are multiple pipelines in your location, you have an additional option to apply the changes to all pipelines.**
- **Customizations are user-specific, meaning the changes will only apply to the user making the modifications, allowing personalized views.**

```
Customizations you make are sticky to the current view, meaning they will persist until you choose to modify them again. However, the customizations only persist for the user on their current local storage and will not be reflected if you launch the same in a different browser or for a different user.
```

## **Feature 3 - Layout Options**

- **Default View:**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034967173/original/XfykkqHnBzgIyvlUzaX_syB5eC1gWTEH5w.png?1729253051)Displays the selected fields with both field labels and values.**
- **Compact View:**



**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034967351/original/ePg8it-v-id4yZhBJvbIsyMY7dqPxqPbsQ.jpeg?1729253160)**
  - **Displays only the values of the selected fields.**
  - **Hovering over a field reveals the label and additional details.**

**Unlabeled View:**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040236440/original/gyQs4ZFRffh_ujnTh-wq4-ZgYnlctenZfg.jpeg?1737530204)**

- **Each line of the card is dedicated to one field**
- **Displays only the values of the selected fields.**
