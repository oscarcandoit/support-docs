Introducing better template management feature in our Template Library for Agency admins.

Problem Statement: Previously, admins navigated through multiple subaccounts to import required templates, which was time-consuming.

?

What we did:

- Direct Create:
Templates can now be imported/ created directly from the Admin screen.
- Streamlined Process:
Choose sub-accounts, preview templates, and rename them seamlessly.

⭐

Benefits:

- Efficiency:
Saves time by consolidating template management into one screen.
- Simplified Workflow:
Eliminates complexity across screens and sub-accounts.

?

How It Works:

1. \- Navigate to Template Library - Admin.
2. \- Click "Create" at the top right.

3. \- Choose the sub-account, product, and template name.
