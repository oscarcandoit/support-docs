# Sharing Social Planner Content Across Sub-Accounts via a Snapshot

Modified on: Tue, 18 Oct, 2022 at 11:06 AM

Reusing Social Planner content across multiple sub-accounts just got that much easier! With the power of Snapshots, you can share social calendars from within the agency settings to any sub-account.

The plan is to add more features in future releases. If you have any ideas or suggestions please let us know by providing feedback within the social planner
