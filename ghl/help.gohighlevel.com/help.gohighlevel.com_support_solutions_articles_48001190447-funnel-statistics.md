## **Site and Funnel Analytics**

While the **Stats** tab inside a funnel provides performance data at the page level, the **Analytics** dashboard offers a broader, more visual overview across all your funnels and websites. It includes interactive graphs, comparison tools, and visitor segmentation, making it easier to spot trends and identify opportunities for optimization.

To explore this centralized reporting view, go to **Sites > Analytics**.

For more information, see [How to Use Site and Funnel Analytics in HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003094-how-to-use-site-and-funnel-analytics-in-highlevel)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why don’t my stats match my Google Analytics data?**

Google Analytics tracks sessions differently than HighLevel. Differences may arise from bounce filtering, ad blockers, or non-funnel entry points.

**Q: Can I automate actions based on page views?**

Yes! You can trigger workflows when a contact views a specific funnel page. To learn more, see [age View Triggers for Funnels and Websites](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002027)

**Q: What qualifies as an 'opt-in'?**

Any successful form submission on a funnel step with a form block counts as an opt-in.
