# **What is the New Knowledge Sources Support?**

HighLevel’s latest Conversation AI release expands the kinds of content your bot can learn from (tables, rich text, files) and layers in a new re-ranking engine that pulls the single most relevant snippet before it answers. Together, these upgrades boost response precision, shorten setup time, and show you exactly which source each answer used.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Knowledge Sources Support & Quality Upgrades**

- **Higher answer accuracy:** Automatic re-ranking ensures the most relevant information is retrieved before generating a response.

- **Faster rollout:** Add or replace data sources instantly without the need for retraining from scratch.

- **Flexible training:** Support for spreadsheets, rich-text documents, PDFs, and more expands what your AI can learn from.

- **Total transparency:** Every response includes clickable source links in the Response Info side drawer for full visibility.

* * *

## **Smarter Retrieval with Re-Ranking**

A lightweight ranking layer now sits between search and answer generation. After the initial vector search returns potential matches, the re-ranker scores each chunk for semantic closeness to the user’s question and sends only the top-ranked passages to the LLM. The result is fewer hallucinations and tighter, on-topic replies.

* * *

## **Expanded Data Type Support**

Your knowledge base no longer speaks “plain-text only.” You can now:

- Paste or upload Tables (CSV/TSV) so AI can reference structured values (e.g., pricing grids).

- Add Rich-Text blocks—including headings, bold, lists—directly in the editor.

- Upload Files (PDF, DOCX, PPT, TXT) and let the system auto-chunk the content for search.

* * *

## **Crystal-Clear Source Attribution**

Every AI response inside Conversations shows a “Response Info” icon. Click it to open the side drawer and view:

- The exact knowledge chunk(s) used.

- File or URL name, FAQ label, and timestamp.

- Quick-edit options to correct or replace the source on the fly.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to retrain the bot after adding a file or table?**

No. Once saved, the new data is indexed instantly and the re-ranker uses it on the next query.

**Q: What file types are supported?**

PDF, DOC/DOCX, PPT/PPTX, TXT, and CSV (for tables).

**Q: What is the maximum number of columns that can be parsed in a table?** The system can parse tables with up to **20 columns**.

**Q: Can I combine tables, rich text, and URLs in one knowledge base?**

Absolutely. The retrieval pipeline treats every chunk equally, then re-ranks for best match.
