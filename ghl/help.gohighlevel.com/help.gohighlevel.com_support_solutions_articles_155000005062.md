## **Create Opportunity by Automation**

Automating opportunity creation keeps your pipeline tidy without the extra clicks. Below is a quick-start example that fires whenever someone submits a form—followed by a note on other triggers you can swap in.

1. **Open Workflows**



Go to **Automation → Workflows** in the left menu.

2. **Start a New Workflow**



Click **\+ Create Workflow** → **Start from Scratch** (or pick a template you want to use).

3. **Add a Trigger – Form Submitted**





   - Click **\+ Add New Trigger** and choose **Form Submitted**.

   - Select the specific form that captures your lead info.

   - Hit **Save Trigger**.
4. **Add an Action – Create/Update Opportunity**





   - Click **+** (Add action button) below the trigger, choose **Opportunity → Create/Update Opportunity**.

   - Pick the **Pipeline** and **Stage** you want new form leads to appear in.

   - Set **Status** to _Open_ (or another status), enter a **Value** if known, and toggle **Allow Opportunity to Move** if you want the record to update when re-entered later.

   - Click **Save Action**



     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053482607/original/qohmxMv7OL6XTZvbXuPyKD1GpV389ALclA.gif?1757511004)
5. **Save & Publish**



**Toggle** the **Draft → Publish** button (top-right). Every future form submission now drops straight into the chosen pipeline stage—hands-free.


**Other Common Triggers & Quick Use Cases**

| Trigger | One-Line Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| **Customer Booked Appointment** | Auto-add prospects to “Consult Scheduled” when they book a call. |
| **Contact Tag** | Move “Hot Lead” contacts into a closing stage the moment the tag is applied. |
| **Facebook Lead Form Submitted** | Pipe leads from FB ads into a “New Facebook Leads” stage for rapid follow-up. |
| **Payment Received** | Create an opportunity in a “Won – Awaiting Onboarding” stage once a purchase is made. |
| **Contact Created** | Start every brand-new contact in “New Lead” to ensure nothing slips through the cracks. |
| **Call Status** | Drop answered inbound calls into a follow-up stage for reps to nurture. |
| **Survey Submitted** | Route completed surveys into a qualification stage for scoring. |

```
Note: The action Create/Update Opportunity stays the same across workflows; only the trigger changes. Pick the trigger that best matches how (and when) a lead should appear in your pipeline.
