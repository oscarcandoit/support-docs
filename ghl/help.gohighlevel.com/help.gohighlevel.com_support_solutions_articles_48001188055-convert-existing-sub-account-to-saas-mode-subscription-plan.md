# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What should I do if the “Share Link” option is not working or is unavailable?**

If the “Share Link” option is not working, first ensure that your browser or network settings are not blocking the pop-up or the link itself. Try using a different browser or clearing your browser’s cache. If the issue persists, check if there are any restrictions or permissions set within your HighLevel account that might be affecting this functionality. You can also contact HighLevel support for further assistance.

**Q: Can I switch an existing sub-account to SaaS mode if it has pending invoices or unpaid balances?**

Yes, you can switch an existing sub-account to SaaS mode even if there are pending invoices or unpaid balances. However, it’s generally good practice to resolve any outstanding balances to avoid complications with billing and account management. Ensure that all financial matters are up-to-date to ensure a smooth transition.

**Q: How can I track the status of the SaaS Mode conversion process for my sub-accounts?**

To track the status of the SaaS Mode conversion, you can monitor the sub-account’s status within your HighLevel dashboard. Look for updates or notifications related to the conversion process. If you do not see any changes or updates, verify that the process was completed successfully. You may also need to check your Stripe account to confirm that the subscription has been created and is active. For detailed tracking, consider reaching out to HighLevel support if you encounter any issues.

**Q: Can I attach a plan to a sub-account that was created before I enabled SaaS Mode?**

Yes, but you'll need to manually assign the SaaS plan using the steps in this article. Legacy accounts won’t be automatically converted unless you assign a plan.

**Q: Will a sub-account lose access to features not included in the SaaS plan tier when it switches to SaaS Mode?**

Yes. When a sub-account is moved to SaaS Mode and a specific plan tier is assigned (e.g., Starter, Professional, or Premium), it will only have access to the features enabled in that tier. Any features previously available that are not included in the selected plan will be disabled automatically. To retain those features, make sure they are included in the plan assigned through the SaaS Configurator.
