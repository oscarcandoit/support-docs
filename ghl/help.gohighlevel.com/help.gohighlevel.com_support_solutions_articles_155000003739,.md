# How to Use Address Auto-Complete in HighLevel Forms and Surveys

Modified on: Wed, 15 Oct, 2025 at 8:32 AM

Address Auto-Complete is now **free and unlimited** in all HighLevel accounts. This feature makes it easier for your leads and customers to enter accurate address details in forms and surveys. As users type into the Address field, real-time suggestions appear and automatically fill in the Street, City, State, Country, and Postal Code fields — ensuring fast, accurate, and consistent data collection.

* * *

## **What is Address Auto-Complete?**

Address Auto-Complete converts the standard Address field in HighLevel forms and surveys into a smart, predictive search bar. It uses an integrated global database to surface relevant address suggestions as users type, making form submission faster and error-free.

Accurate address data is essential for workflows, segmentation, reporting, and delivery-based actions. Address Auto-Complete eliminates typing errors, guarantees consistent formatting, and speeds up form completion, improving both user experience and data reliability.

### **Smart Search Suggestions**

As a user types into the Address field, HighLevel provides live predictive suggestions based on real-world address data.

### **Auto-Fill Address Fields**

When the user selects an address from the dropdown, all relevant fields (Street, City, State, Country, and Postal Code) are automatically filled. This ensures consistent formatting and eliminates manual data entry errors.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Address Auto-Complete**

The Address Auto-Complete feature enhances every form submission by ensuring contact data is validated, consistent, and properly formatted. This reduces downstream corrections and increases user satisfaction.

- **Free & Unlimited:** Included in every HighLevel account with no usage limits.

- **Improved Data Accuracy:** Ensures consistent, validated address entries.

- **Faster Submissions:** Reduces typing effort for leads and clients.

- **Higher Conversion Rates:** Frictionless user experience leads to more form completions.

- **Better Data for Reporting:** Standardized address formats improve automation accuracy.

## **How to Enable Address Auto-Complete**

### **Add the Address Field**

Navigate to **Sites → Forms** (or **Surveys**) and open the form builder where you want to use Address Auto-Complete.

In the **Form Elements** panel, drag the **Address** field into your form layout. The Address element is marked as **Updated**, indicating that it supports Auto-Complete functionality.

### **Access Address Field Settings**

After adding the Address field, click on it to open the settings panel on the right side of the screen.

This panel allows you to customize address behavior, enable auto-complete, and control whether users must select a verified address.

### **Enable Auto-Complete Address**

In the settings panel, locate the toggle labeled **Auto-Complete Address** and switch it **ON**.

Once activated, this setting transforms the standard address input into a smart search bar that suggests accurate addresses as users type.

### **Make Address Selection Mandatory**

If you want to ensure that users only submit validated addresses, toggle **Mandatory to Select Address in Search Bar** to **ON**.

When enabled, users must pick one of the suggested addresses before they can submit the form. If left OFF, they can enter an address manually.

### **Preview the Form**

Click **Preview** at the top right of the form builder to see how the Address field appears in the live form.

The Address field will now display a **search bar**, allowing users to begin typing and instantly view address suggestions as they type.

### **Test Live Address Suggestions**

In the preview, type a few characters (such as part of a street name) into the Address field.

You’ll see predictive suggestions appear below the search bar — selecting one will automatically populate the Street, City, State, Country, and Postal Code fields.

### **Save and Publish**

After confirming that Auto-Complete works as expected, click **Save** to apply your changes.

Once published, every visitor who fills out the form will experience fast, accurate address entry powered by built-in Auto-Complete.
