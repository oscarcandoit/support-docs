## **What Are Round Robin Calendars and how do they work?**

A **Round Robin Calendar** is a scheduling system that automatically distributes appointments among assigned team members. It ensures **fair workload distribution** and **optimizes availability** by automatically checking which team member is available at the requested time. Some key points about **Round Robin Calendars**:

- **At least one team member** must be assigned to a Round Robin Calendar during setup.
- When a customer **requests an appointment**, the system first checks the **availability of the first assigned team member**.
- If the first team member is **not available**, it automatically moves to the **next team member**.
- This continues until an **available team member** is found.
- If **no team members** are available at the selected time, the system **prevents customers from booking an empty slot**, ensuring they only see valid appointment options.

**Key Benefit:** Customers only book appointments when a team member is actually available, eliminating scheduling conflicts and reducing manual intervention.

* * *

## **Why Use Round Robin Calendars?**

Round Robin Calendars provide several advantages, especially for teams that **share appointments** or handle **client interactions collectively**. Some key benefits are as follows:

- **Efficient Scheduling** – Automates appointment assignments, saving time and reducing manual effort.

- **Balanced Workload** – Distributes appointments evenly, preventing one team member from being overloaded.

- **Faster Response Times** – Ensures the **next available** team member gets assigned, improving customer experience.

- **Flexibility for Clients** – Customers can choose **any available slot**, increasing scheduling convenience.

- **Ideal for Scaling Teams** – Helps growing businesses manage high volumes of appointments without bottlenecks.

* * *

## **Creating the Round Robin Calendar**

Creating a Round Robin Calendar ensures that appointments are automatically distributed among available team members. This step involves selecting the calendar type, configuring the appointment distribution logic, and assigning at least one team member.

**Step 1**: Navigate to **Settings → Calendars** in HighLevel, click on **Create Calendar,** and select the **Round Robin** as the calendar type.

```
You can also Click on the Calendars Tab in the Subaccount, click on Calendar Settings and then click on Create Calendar and select the Round Robin as the calendar type.
```

**Step 2: Calendar Name and Description:** Here, you can assign a name to the calendar and add a description based on your requirements. The description helps clarify the purpose of the calendar, making it easier to remember its intended use or the reason it was created.

**Step 3: Select Team Members:** Choose one or more team members who will be assigned appointments through the Round-Robin scheduling system.

**Step 4**: **Custom URL**: A unique URL slug is automatically created based on your calendar name. If needed, you can edit it manually. When edited, the system will check the URL availability. If the URL is already taken, you’ll see a message and can modify it until you find an available one.

**Step 5: Meeting Duration and Booking Availability:** HighLevel allows you to **customize meeting durations** in both **minutes and hours**, ensuring flexibility based on your business needs. You can set up your calendar based on **team member preferences** or **company-wide scheduling policies**. You can configure **specific dates and exceptions**, ensuring precise control over when appointments can be scheduled.

For detailed steps on customizing availability, refer to [Calendar Availability - Weekly Working Hours & Date-Specific Hours](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001716-calendar-availability-weekly-working-hours-date-specific-hours?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**Step 6: Accept Payments:** The **Accept Payments tab** allows you to enable payments directly through your calendar. If your services or products require payment, you can toggle this option to accept payments seamlessly during the booking process.

HighLevel also provides a variety of currency options, allowing **Multiple Currency Support**. You can add a **C** **ustom Description** under the Payment Information section. This helps customers understand the payment terms, pricing details, or any special instructions before completing their booking.

**Step 7: Save the Calendar**: Once all the settings have been customized, click on **Save** to **Create** your **Round-Robin Calendar.**
