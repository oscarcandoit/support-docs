# General Questions

## Why do I need to confirm my contacts have consented to hear from me while importing contacts?

Two main reasons why the consent from contacts is helpful while importing contacts:

- **Protect Your Sending Reputation: I** mporting bulk contacts without proper consent can lead to higher bounce and spam rates, negatively impacting your sending reputation.
- **Prevent Issues with Purchased or Rented Lists:** Even if some lists claim to have opt-in consent, they may not be suitable for marketing communication tools. Contacts from purchased or rented sources are likely to bounce, unsubscribe, mark emails as spam, and may cause blocklistings.

## What are the different bulk actions that cannot be restored?

The following bulk actions cannot be restored:

- Bulk Email
- Bulk Email Verification
- Bulk Update Contacts to Company
- Bulk Tag Add
- Bulk SMS
