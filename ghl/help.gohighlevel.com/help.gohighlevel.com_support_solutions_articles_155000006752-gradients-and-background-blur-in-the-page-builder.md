# **What are Gradients and Background Blurs?**

Gradients let you blend two or more colors smoothly to create visual depth, while background blur softens the content beneath an element to boost contrast and readability. Together, these tools reduce the need for external design apps and help you build polished layouts directly in HighLevel.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Gradients & Background Blur**

- **Multi-Color Control**: Build gradients with up to 10 color stops for subtle or vibrant blends.

- **Style Variety**: Choose Linear, Radial, or Angular gradient types to match your layout.

- **Precision Editing**: Drag color stops on a visual slider and set angles for exact results.

- **Instant Depth**: Toggle Background Blur and adjust intensity to create soft, professional “glass” effects.

- **Clean Workflow**: Switch quickly between **Color**, **Image**, and **Video** background tabs to pick the best background source.


* * *

## **Where You Can Apply These Backgrounds**

Backgrounds live at the container level. Use them at the **section**, **row**, or **column** level to control how effects cascade and how content sits above them.

- Apply gradients or blur on **Sections** for full-width hero areas.

- Use **Rows** to create banded backgrounds across multiple columns.

- Apply blur or a subtle gradient on **Columns** to improve text readability for a specific content block.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How many colors can I use in a gradient?**

Up to 10 color stops.

**Q: Will existing background images and videos change?**

No. Previous settings remain as they are; gradients and blur are additional options.

**Q: Does blur affect content inside the element?**

Blur softens what’s behind the element. Content inside the element (like text) remains crisp.

**Q: I’m seeing banding/stripes in my gradient. How can I fix it?**

Try one or more of these: add an extra intermediate stop near the harsh transition, choose colors closer in lightness and slightly adjust the Angle slider.

**Q: How do I remove a color stop or revert to a solid color?**

Click the X next to a stop to delete it. To go back to a solid color, toggle Gradient off and pick a single color on the Color tab.
