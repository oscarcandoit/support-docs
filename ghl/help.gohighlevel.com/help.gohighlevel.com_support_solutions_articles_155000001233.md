# Paid Groups

Modified on: Tue, 19 Mar, 2024 at 2:42 PM

## Group Access

To grant access after receiving the payment:

- Once the payment is made, admins and owners need to follow the same process of providing access to members for Private Groups (Go to People Tab > Click on the Filter > Requested > Accept or Deny Membership)
- For Public Groups, once the payment is made the user signs up and becomes a member right after

## Notifications

- All admins and owners receive email notification about the payment made by a user with all the details, to join the group and subsequently to request membership (as per group type)
- Similarly, the users also receive a payment confirmation with all the details about their payment
- Once their membership is approved by admin or owner. They are further notified about their membership and access of the group


## Cancellations and Refunds

- **What happens when a member cancels their subscription from the GHL Payments screen?**



When a user cancels their subscription from the GHL Payments screen, several actions are initiated:

\- The user will receive a cancellation confirmation email.

\- Admins and Owners of the group associated with the subscription will receive a cancellation received email.

\- The user will be automatically removed from the group.


- **What happens when a members cancels their subscription from the Stripe screen?**

\- The user will be automatically removed from the group.

- **How can members get refund for their payments**

Members can get their refunds from both Stripe or GHL Payment




1. **From GHL** Refunds can be issued by going to "Payments" > "Transactions" > click the "three dots" icon on the right side of a transaction line item > click "Refund"

3. **From Stripe**

     Refunds can also be issued from Stripe via the contact details screen

- **If a user's contact card is deleted and later restored, will the user need to make the payment again?**



As of the current system functionality, when a user's contact card is accidentally deleted and then restored, the user should be reinstated in the Group without being required to make the payment again.

- **What are the minimum and maximum charge amounts for different currencies?**



For minimum and maximum charges, refer to [https://stripe.com/docs/currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies)
