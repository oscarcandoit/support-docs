# How to Use FTP to Access Your WordPress Website

Modified on: Mon, 27 Oct, 2025 at 1:10 AM

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is a secure and fast way to access your website’s files. You can upload, download, or edit files directly, just like managing files on your computer.

### ? Why You Might Use FTP:

- Upload custom plugins or themes

- Edit wp-config or .htaccess files

- Troubleshoot white screen or plugin issues

- Download backups or specific files


* * *

### ✅ What You’ll Need

Before connecting via FTP, grab these details from your WordPress Hosting dashboard (under **Sites → WordPress → Advanced Settings → FTP Access**):

- **Host** (e.g., `103.67.202.37`)

- **Port** (usually `21`)

- **Username** (e.g., `example@ssvnXXXX.wpdns.site`)

- **Password** (click “Reset Password” if not available)

### ? Step-by-Step: Connect to FTP Using FileZilla

We recommend [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), a free and trusted FTP client.

#### 1\. **Download and Install FileZilla**

- Visit: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php

- Choose the version for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

- FileZilla Client Downloads



  - **Windows (64-bit):** [Download FileZilla Client for Windows](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64)
  - **macOS (Apple Silicon):** [Download FileZilla Client for macOS (Apple Silicon)](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=macos-arm64)
  - **macOS (Intel):** [Download FileZilla Client for macOS (Intel)](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx)
  - **Linux (64-bit):** [Download FileZilla Client for Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://filezilla-project.org/download.php%3Fplatform%3Dlinux-x86_64)

#### 2\. **Open FileZilla and Enter Your Credentials**

At the top of the FileZilla window:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Host** | Your FTP Host (e.g., `103.67.202.37`) |
| **Username** | Provided in the dashboard |
| **Password** | The one you generated/reset |
| **Port** | `21` |

Then click **Quickconnect**.

#### 3\. **Navigate Your Website Files**

- **Right side** = Your website files on the server

- **Left side** = Your local computer files

- You can **drag & drop files** between both sides.


* * *

### ? Pro Tips

- Don’t delete files unless you know what they do.

- To edit a file, right-click and select **View/Edit**.

- Always **download a backup** before making changes.


* * *

### ❓Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Can't connect | Double-check password, port, and host IP |
| Timeout error | Try passive mode in FileZilla → Settings |
| Permission denied | Contact your admin or reset FTP password |

* * *

### ? Helpful Resources

- [Beginner FTP Video Guide (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=filezilla+ftp+tutorial)

- Site name

- Username

- Screenshot of your FileZilla settings
