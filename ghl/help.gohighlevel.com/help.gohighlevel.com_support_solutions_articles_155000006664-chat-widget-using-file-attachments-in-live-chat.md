# Chat Widget: Using File Attachments in Live Chat

Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 10:59 AM

A faster way to solve customer problems is now just a click away. Attachments in Live Chat Widgets let website visitors drop images or PDFs directly into the chat so your team gets the context it needs—no more chasing screenshots over email.

# **What is Attachments in Live Chat Widgets?**

Attachments in Live Chat Widgets add a file-upload button (and drag-and-drop support) to the Live Chat type of HighLevel’s website chat widget. Visitors can include up to five images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .heic) or PDF documents per message (max 20 MB each). Agents see those files inside the Conversations inbox where they can preview or download them just like any other attachment.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Attachments in Live Chat Widgets**

- Resolve issues faster—customers can “show” the problem instead of typing long explanations.


- Improve first-contact resolution by collecting all context in one place.


- Reduce back-and-forth emails requesting screenshots or documents.


- Mobile-friendly workflow: visitors can send camera or gallery photos from their phones.


- Secure sharing—unsupported files, oversized uploads, or duplicate selections are blocked automatically.


* * *

## **How To Setup Attachments in Live Chat Widgets**

Give your visitors the power to send files in just a few clicks.

1. Navigate to Sites ➞ Chat Widget and either create or open your Live Chat widget. (No additional builder settings are required.)
2. Deploy the widget to your website or funnel using the existing embed code.

* * *

### **Test the file-upload flow**

1. Open the page in a browser.

2. Click the paperclip, select a supported file, type a message, and send.

3. Confirm the attachment appears in your Conversations inbox.

* * *

### **Supported File Types & Limits**

Visitors can safely upload common visuals and documents without risking oversized transfers.

- Accepted extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .heic, .pdf


- Max files per message: 5


- Max size per file: 20 MB


- Filenames containing repeated spaces or characters such as +, <, > may be rejected for security.

| ### **Uploading From Desktop** | ### **Uploading From Mobile** |
| Drag files from the computer’s file explorer straight onto the widget, or click the paperclip to browse. | On phones and tablets, tapping the paperclip surfaces the device’s Camera or Gallery picker so visitors can snap a live photo or choose an existing image. |
| The chat clears any file that is too large or not supported, prompting the visitor to try again with acceptable files. | All size, type, and quantity rules still apply to keep uploads clean. |

* * *

### **Viewing Attachments in Conversations**

Inside Conversations, agents get a consistent experience:

- JPG/PNG previews appear inline click to expand.


- HEIC/PDF display as a filename with a download button.


- Files can be saved to the Media Library or added to the contact’s Documents tab if desired.


* * *

### **Enable Conversation AI Image Responses**

If you use an AI Agent, you can let the bot analyze customer screenshots and reply automatically:

1. Go to Agency view ➞ Settings ➞ Labs.
2. Open the Sub-Account tab and toggle Respond to images.

In your AI Agent, enable Allow this bot to respond to images.

```
Note: AI currently responds only to images, not PDFs.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can agents send files back to visitors?**

Not yet. File upload from the Conversations inbox is planned for a future release.

**Q: What happens if a visitor attaches a 25 MB PDF?**

The widget clears the file and asks the visitor to choose a file under 20 MB.

**Q: Why doesn’t drag-and-drop work for me?**

Ensure you are dragging from your file explorer/finder window, not from another browser tab or app window.

**Q: Are videos supported?**

No. The first release supports JPG, JPEG, PNG, HEIC, and PDF only.

**Q: Do file uploads respect widget office hours?**

Yes. If chat is offline, visitors can still leave a message with attachments, which will appear in Conversations for follow-up.

**Q: Can these attachments sync to the contact’s Documents tab?**

Yes—agents can use the three-dot menu on an inbound message to “Add to Documents.”

**Q: Will AI read text inside a PDF?**

Not at this time; AI image responses analyze images only.
