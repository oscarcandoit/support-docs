#### **What is Partial Payment?**

Partial payment offers bookers the opportunity to secure bookings by paying a deposit upfront, with the remaining balance settled at a later time. Alongside collecting full payments, businesses now have the capability to collect deposit amounts from bookers. This feature has been seamlessly implemented across all calendar types and aids in reserving seats.

With this new feature, users have the flexibility to determine either a flat amount or a percentage of the total amount to be charged to the booker at the time of booking.

When partial payments are enabled, two entries appear in payments:

- **Transaction:** The amount charged during booking (Deposit Amount).

- **Invoices**: The pending amount to be collected from the booker (Total Amount - Deposit Amount). The invoice status remains in draft, and users are required to manually collect the pending amount.
