## **Add a Custom Template**

**Step 1: Navigate to the correct Product**

The Template Library is one function but to reduce confusion the Template Library only shows items from one Product at a time.

**Marketing Products**

If you want to add a **Social Planner** post as a template, navigate to Marketing > Social Planner > Content tab > CSV tab. Click on the 3-dot action menu next to the item you want to turn into a template and click Upload to social templates.

For **Email Templates**, which are also called Templates (so they're Template Templates), navigate to Marketing > Emails > Templates tab > find the one you want then click the 3-dot action menu and Upload to email templates.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048951072/original/8_mZ_Od0jdif_TRjkBSKZ8jY_x6Sem_IaA.png?1750972325)

**Automation Products**

If you want to add a Workflow as a template, navigate to Automation > Workflows > find the one you want and click the 3-dot action menu and select Upload to Template Library.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048951128/original/h9AAmHbx2NEFuCgcCVRCk0Ly-AZF03xWIA.png?1750972572)

**Sites Products**

If you want to add a **Funnel, Website, Store, Blog, Email, Form, Survey, or Quiz** as a template, navigate to Sites > \[product\] > find the one you want and click the 3-dot action menu and select "Upload to \[product\] templates".

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048948173/original/29JquXnGXLuL3P-Oo70I0sTpGYa7Vpzq0g.png?1750964899)

**Step 2: Name and Categorize the Template**

In the new modal titled "Upload to \[product\] templates" type a display name for the template and add it to a category. When you are satisfied, click Upload.

**Step 3: Edit Template in Admin Mode**

You will be taken to the admin mode to edit all of the library settings for the \[product\] template. You can edit:

1. **Name**

2. **Category**

3. **Preview**

4. **Cover image:** Upload a thumbnail or preview image to visually represent the template.

5. **Tags**: Add searchable tags that help users quickly find your template (ex: New Years).

6. **Prerequisites**: Specify requirements to use the functions in the template (ex: Stripe, email domain).

7. **Short Description**: This is a quick summary that appears in the preview card of the Template Library.

8. **Long About**: Everything else: detail use cases, content tips, or setup instructions, etc. This section supports basic formatting, so you can include feature highlights, usage instructions, or best practice tips. Think of it as a mini overview that helps users decide how and when to use the template.

**Step 4: Publish**

Once the template is ready, click Publish Template to make it public (this will make the template visible in subaccounts to be used by subaccount clients).

The Subaccount clients will see the custom template like all other templates in their template library.

The Agency will also see the custom template like other templates, but will have more options.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Who can add or edit templates details in the Template Library?**

Only users with the Agency Admin role can add and manage templates.

**Is adding Custom Templates available on all plans?**

The option to add and manage custom Templates is only available on the $497/mo pro plan.

**If there are any updates in template added to template library, what happens?**

Changes made to the original source of the template will not flow through to the template in the Template Library.

**Can we hide/edit Templates already present in Template Library?**

The individual templates cannot be hidden, but Categories can be hidden, so if you add a template to only one Category, and that Category is hidden, then the Template will not appear in any Subaccount's view of the Template Library.
