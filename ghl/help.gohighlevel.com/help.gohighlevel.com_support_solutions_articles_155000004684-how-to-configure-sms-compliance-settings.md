# **What is SMS Compliance Settings?**

SMS Compliance Settings ensure that outbound SMS messages meet carrier and policy expectations by automatically appending **opt‑out language** (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”) and **sender identification** (e.g., “Thanks, Alex at Main Street Dental”) when those elements are missing. Enabling these controls protects deliverability, reduces filtering risk, and supports a consistent, compliant experience.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of SMS Compliance Settings**

Understanding the value makes adoption easy. These benefits map directly to carrier guidelines and practical day‑to‑day messaging needs.

- **Compliance-by-default**: Automatically appends sender ID and opt‑out language to the first message when missing.

- **Reduced carrier filtering**: Adds the elements carriers expect, lowering the chance of messages being blocked.

- **Brand clarity**: **Sender identification** helps recipients recognize who is texting them, improving trust and reply rates.

- **Automated cadence**: Every‑X‑days control re‑inserts sender ID + opt‑out on a schedule (e.g., every 30 days) to maintain ongoing compliance.

- **De‑duplication**: Prevents duplicate opt‑out text when you already include it in your message template.

## **Tips, Guidelines & Rules**

- The first message in any SMS conversation (including **Missed Call Text Back** and **review requests**) will always include both of the following. Example: _“Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”_

- The **Opt Out** message will only be added if it is not already included in the message.

- **Agencies in Trial Mode** cannot disable these checkboxes.

- **Locations/sub-accounts** created within the last **15 days** cannot disable these checkboxes.

- **Account Users and Admins** cannot disable these checkboxes.

- Strong, simple wording improves deliverability and avoids content that may be flagged by carriers.\*

- Sender ID examples: _“Thanks, Jamie at Oak & Co.”_ or _“—Team Acme Fitness.”_

- Avoid spammy formatting, excessive emojis, URL shorteners, and vague brand references.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I disable sender ID or opt‑out language?**

If you’re in trial mode, managing a location less than 15 days old, or have restricted user permissions, you may not be able to disable these options. HighLevel recommends keeping them enabled to maintain compliance.

**Q: What happens if my message already has opt‑out language?**

A: HighLevel won’t add duplicate opt‑out text; it only appends the required line if it’s missing.

**Q: How do I customize the opt‑out or sender text?**

A: Edit the text fields next to each control (or click **Customize**, if shown) in the SMS Compliance tab. Use clear, concise wording (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”).

**Q: What words are carrier compliant for out-out message?**

STOP, STOPALL, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, END, or QUIT.
