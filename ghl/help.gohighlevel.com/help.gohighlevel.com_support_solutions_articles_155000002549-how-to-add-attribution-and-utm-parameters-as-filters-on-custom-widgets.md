The Attribution Parameters on Contacts and Opportunity Widgets feature empowers users to gain deeper insights into their contact and opportunity sources and activities. With this functionality, users can filter based on First or Last attribution, utilize key UTM parameters, and create detailed, custom widgets. These enhancements enable users to group and view data by properties such as Activity, Session Source, and Medium, creating interactive donut and line graphs. Additionally, the feature allows for comprehensive reporting with the inclusion of new properties in the granular insights table and CSV exports, as well as customizable columns in the Table widget. This functionality is designed to provide users with greater flexibility and control over their data visualization and reporting needs, ultimately enhancing their ability to track and optimize contact and opportunity sources effectively.
