## **Implementing Stripe Tax Management as a Workaround for SaaS Agencies**

In addition to the Tax Settings feature, SaaS agencies operating in regions like the EU, UK, and North America can benefit from implementing the Stripe tax management workaround.

Moreover, this approach simplifies tax compliance by ensuring adherence to tax laws in target regions.

A SaaS platform provides a core service and offers various add-ons that users can purchase. The tax rates for the core service and add-ons may vary depending on the region.

Benefits:

Flexible Tax Application: The Stripe tax management workaround allows the SaaS company to apply different tax rates for the core service and add-ons, ensuring accurate billing.

Enhanced Customer Experience: Transparent tax calculation during checkout improves customer experience, fostering trust and satisfaction.

**Usage Case 3: SaaS Company Expanding Internationally**

## **FAQs**

### **How do I handle tax exemptions for specific customers using the CRM Tax Settings feature or the SaaS workaround?**

Answer: For the CRM Tax Settings feature, create a tax with a 0% rate and apply it to the exempt customer's invoice. For the SaaS workaround, create a custom tax rate with a 0% rate in Stripe and apply it to the exempt customer's subscription.

### **Can I use multiple tax rates with the CRM Tax Settings feature and the SaaS workaround?**

Answer: Both methods allow you to create and apply multiple tax rates for different products, services, or customer locations. You can add various taxes to an invoice in the CRM Tax Settings feature. In the SaaS workaround, you can select the appropriate tax rate when editing a customer's subscription in Stripe or configure your third-party Stripe integration to apply the correct tax rate during checkout.

### **What happens if a customer changes their location or billing address?**

Answer: You must update the customer's tax rate based on their new address for both methods. In the CRM Tax Settings feature, update the taxes on their invoice. For the SaaS workaround, update their subscription in Stripe and configure your third-party Stripe integration to automatically update tax rates during checkout.

### **Can I apply taxes to one-time purchases using both methods?**

Answer: By adding taxes to an invoice, you can apply taxes to one-time purchases using the CRM Tax Settings feature. With the SaaS workaround, create tax rates in Stripe and use a third-party integration that supports dynamic tax calculation during checkout.

### **How do both methods handle refunds?**

Answer: For the CRM Tax Settings feature, adjust the tax amounts manually on the refunded invoice. With the SaaS workaround, Stripe will automatically calculate and refund the correct amount of taxes based on the original transaction.

### **Can I generate tax reports using both methods?**

Answer: The CRM Tax Settings feature does not directly provide tax reports, but you can export invoice data, including tax information, and use third-party tools or accounting software to generate tax reports. For the SaaS workaround, export transaction data from Stripe and use similar tools or software to create tax reports.

### **How do I handle tax changes or updates using both methods?**

Answer: For the CRM Tax Settings feature, update the tax rates in your tax list and apply the updated rates to new invoices. For the SaaS workaround, revise the tax rates in Stripe and edit existing customer subscriptions to apply the updated rates. You may also need to update your third-party Stripe integration settings to ensure accurate tax calculations during the checkout process.
