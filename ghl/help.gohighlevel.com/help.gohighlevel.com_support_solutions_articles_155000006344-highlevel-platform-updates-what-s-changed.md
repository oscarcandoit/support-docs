# HighLevel Platform Updates - What’s Changed

Modified on: Thu, 18 Sep, 2025 at 12:25 PM

We’ve updated our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to better serve you and provide clearer guidance on how our platform works. Here’s what changed and what it means for you.

These changes will go into effect September 22, 2025

* * *

## **Terms of Service Updates**

1. **Your Responsibility for Data Privacy Compliance.** We've clarified that when you use HighLevel to collect and manage your clients' data, you're responsible for following privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. You need to make sure you have proper consent from your clients and follow applicable privacy laws when collecting their information through our platform. Check out our [Customer Privacy Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/knES3eSWYIsc5YSZ3YLl/media/68b996316510b9febd3b314c.pdf) for more information.

2. **AI Features Guidelines.** We've added an AI Policy that explains how our AI tools work and sets guidelines for using them responsibly. When using our AI features, you should review the output before using it with your clients. AI tools are powerful but not perfect, so human oversight is important.

3. **Domain Name Management.** We can now manage domain names purchased through our platform, including resolving disputes like trademark complaints. If someone files a complaint about a domain you purchased through HighLevel, we can handle the legal process and make decisions to resolve the issue quickly.

4. **HIPAA Add-On Requirements.** For HIPAA-enabled accounts, your Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is now tied to maintaining an active paid subscription to our HIPAA package. You must keep your HIPAA package subscription active in order to have an effective BAA–if your HIPAA package subscription lapses, your BAA with HighLevel may automatically expire.

5. **Tax Calculation Terms.** We've added specific terms for our tax calculation features. When you use tax features in HighLevel, remember that we're connecting you to tax calculation services - you're still responsible for ensuring tax compliance for your business and clients.

* * *

## **Privacy Policy Updates**

1. **HighLevel’s Role.** We've made it more clear when HighLevel acts as a data processor (handling data on your behalf) versus when we're the data controller (responsible for our own data collection).

2. **California Privacy Law.** We’ve clarified that under California law, some of our standard business practices (like affiliate marketing and advertising pixels) may be considered "sharing" or "selling" data. This doesn't change how we actually handle your data - California's privacy law defines "selling" very broadly to include common marketing activities, even when no money changes hands for the data itself.

3. **Affiliate Program.** We’ve clarified that when you sign up through an affiliate link, we share basic information with that affiliate. This is standard practice for affiliate programs and helps us reward people who introduce others to our platform.

4. **Subprocessor Updates.** We've added three new AI service providers to our list of subprocessors: Retell AI, Synthflow, and Botpress. These companies help power specific AI features within our platform. These new partners allow us to offer enhanced AI capabilities like voice AI, conversational flows, and chatbot features. All data processing with these providers follows the same strict protections outlined in our agreements, and their role is limited to powering specific AI features you choose to use.
