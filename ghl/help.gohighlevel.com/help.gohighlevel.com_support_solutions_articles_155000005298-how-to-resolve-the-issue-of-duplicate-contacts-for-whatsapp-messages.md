# How to Resolve the Issue of Duplicate Contacts for WhatsApp Messages

Modified on: Fri, 16 May, 2025 at 7:12 AM

### **Overview**

This document outlines the steps to resolve an issue where duplicate contacts are created for WhatsApp messages, even when the "Allow Duplicate Contact" setting is disabled in the Business Profile.

### **Symptoms**

- Duplicate contact entries are displayed for WhatsApp messages.

- The **Allow Duplicate Contact** option is disabled under **Business Profile** settings.

- Despite this, the duplication persists.


### **Cause**

This issue may occur if the contact search preferences are not configured to include phone numbers as a secondary search criterion.

### **Resolution Steps**

1. Navigate to **Business Profile**.

2. Go to **Contact Duplicate Preference**.

3. Under **Second Preference for Search (Optional)**, ensure that **Phone** is selected.


### **Explanation**

Selecting **Phone** as the secondary preference for contact search enables the system to match contacts based on phone numbers, which helps prevent the creation of duplicate contact entries.
