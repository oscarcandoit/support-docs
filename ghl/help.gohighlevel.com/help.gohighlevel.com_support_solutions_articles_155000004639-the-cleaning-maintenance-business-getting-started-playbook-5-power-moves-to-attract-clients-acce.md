#### **89% of customers search online** before booking a cleaning service.  **70% of leads go to the first company that follows up.**  **Recurring bookings & loyal customers** are the key to steady revenue.

#### ❌ **If you're not ranking, responding, or advertising correctly—you’re losing money.**

### **Step 1: Get Found on Google & Dominate Local Search**

#### **Why This Matters?**

#### **76% of cleaning service customers hire** from the first page of Google.  Businesses with **100+ Google reviews get 3X more bookings**.

#### If you **aren’t showing up on Google**, your competitors are getting the jobs instead.

#### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Claim & Verify Your Google Business Profile (GMB)** – If you haven’t done this yet, **you’re invisible to customers**.

#### [How to Set Up Google Business Profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177?hl=en)  ✅ **Set Up Service Areas** – List all the zip codes & neighborhoods you serve so Google ranks you in local searches.  ✅ **Add a Call Tracking Number** – Replace your Google listing number with a **HighLevel tracking number** to see where leads are coming from.

#### [How to Set Up a Call Tracking Number](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001179764-call-tracking-and-missed-call-text-back-through-google-business-profile)  ✅ **Automate Google Reviews** – More 5-star reviews = **higher rankings & more calls**.

#### [How to Automate Google Reviews](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003873-how-to-setup-workflow-triggers-for-google-and-facebook-reviews)  ✅ **Post Weekly Updates** – Google **ranks active businesses higher**—use HighLevel to **schedule posts automatically**.

#### [How to Optimize Your Google Business Profile](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222899-how-to-integrate-your-google-business-profile-formerly-gmb-into-the-crm)

#### **Example:** "We helped over 250 homes stay fresh this month! Need a spotless home? Book your cleaning today!" (Post this on your Google Business Profile weekly.)

* * *

### **Step 2: Automate Follow-Ups & Stop Losing Leads**

#### **Why This Matters?**

#### **Leads go cold in 5 minutes**—if you don’t respond, they’ll hire someone else.  **Automating follow-ups increases conversions by 40%**.

#### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Set Up a Chat Widget on Your Website** – So customers can **text you without calling**.

#### [How to Set Up Chat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)  ✅ **Enable Missed Call Text-Back** – If you miss a call, **HighLevel texts the lead back automatically**, so you don’t lose the job.

#### [Setting up Missed Call Text Back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001239140-where-and-how-to-configure-the-missed-call-text-back-feature)  ✅ **Send Instant Follow-Ups** – Automate **SMS, email, and WhatsApp reminders** to book appointments.

#### [Setting Up Recurring Follow Ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003450-recurring-appointments)  ✅ **Add a Booking Link** – Let customers **schedule their own cleaning service** online **without waiting** for a call back.  ✅ **Use AI to Handle Inquiries** – ConversationAI and Voice AI **answer common questions & schedule jobs automatically**.

[How to Set Up Conversation AI Agent](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000210-how-to-use-conversation-ai-to-book-appointments)

#### **Example:**  _"Hi \[Name\], thanks for inquiring about our cleaning services! We have a few slots available this week. Book here: \[Booking Link\]"_

* * *

### **Step 3: Automate Reviews & Build a Reputation That Sells For You**

#### **Why This Matters?**

#### **Businesses with 50+ reviews rank 270% higher** in Google searches.  **90% of customers trust online reviews** as much as personal referrals.

#### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Enable Review Requests in HighLevel** – Every cleaning job should trigger an **automatic SMS & email asking for a review**.  ✅ **Direct Customers to Google & Facebook** – The more **5-star reviews you have, the more leads Google sends you**.  ✅ **Monitor & Respond to Reviews** – Google **ranks businesses higher** that **respond to every review—good or bad**.  ✅ **Set Up Negative Review Alerts & Dispute Bad Reviews** – Catch **bad reviews instantly** and **fix the issue** before it affects your reputation.  ✅ **Showcase Reviews on Your Website & Social Media** – Let **your happy customers sell for you**.

#### **Example:**  _"We’d love to hear your feedback! If we made your home sparkle, leave us a quick review: \[Review Link\]"_

* * *

### **Step 4: Launch a Small, High-ROI Ad Campaign (No Guesswork Needed)**

#### **Why This Matters?**

#### **60% of homeowners click on ads when searching for cleaning services.**  Even **$10/day on ads** can bring a **steady stream of clients**.

#### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)** – Only **pay for valid leads**, not clicks.

#### [How to Run Google LSA](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/local-services-ads/)  [How To Integrate LSA with HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001217374-reserve-with-google-integration-local-services-ads-lsa-)  ✅ **Run Facebook Lead Ads** – Target **local homeowners & office managers** who need professional cleaning services.

* * *

### **Step 5: Post Weekly & Stay Visible with Social Media**

#### **77% of homeowners check social media before hiring a cleaning company.**  Posting consistently = **More bookings & referrals**.

#### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Post Weekly on Google Business** – Google **ranks active businesses higher**.  ✅ **Use Facebook & Instagram to Share Before & After Photos** – Show off your best work!

#### [How to Share your reviews on Social Media](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001620-share-your-reviews-as-posts-on-social-media-using-social-planner)  ✅ **Start a Blog & Email Newsletter** – Share **cleaning tips & home care hacks**.
