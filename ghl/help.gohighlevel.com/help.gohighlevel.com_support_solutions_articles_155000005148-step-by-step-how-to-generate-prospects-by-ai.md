# Step by Step how to generate Prospects by AI

Modified on: Thu, 24 Apr, 2025 at 2:00 PM

Prospect by AI is a smart, automated way to receive 2–3 high-quality prospect recommendations every week — based on your selected niche and target area. Powered by intelligent scoring and data signals, this feature helps agencies and locations find better leads, faster — without the manual effort.

Once enabled, AI analyzes your configured niche and location preferences to surface top-matching businesses and delivers them directly to your dashboard, ready for outreach.

Available to

1. All Agencies – via Labs
2. All Locations – via Labs

-\> If you have subscribed to Premium Prospecting, you would be able to receive premium reports via AI else Basic Reports by default

# How to Enable It

In Agency

1. Go to Labs inside your agency
2. Toggle ON “Prospect by AI”
3. Navigate to Prospecting → Settings → AI Report Configuration
4. Turn ON the AI Recommendations toggle and Save
5. If you have Free Plan: You can still use this AI Feature completely meaning you will get 2-3 AI Generated Prospects but reports generated will be basic reports only (not Premium Reports)

In Sub Accounts

1. Go to Labs inside your sub accounts
2. Toggle ON “Prospect by AI”
3. Navigate to Marketing Tab -> Prospecting → Settings → AI Report Configuration ( Remember to access Prospecting in Sub Account, you must first enable it under reselling tab in agency)
4. Turn ON

# How to Configure it

1. Select upto three niches you want to generate prospects for
2. Set the country, city, area and Pin code so AI can use them to find right prospect
3. By Default basic Reports is available for all, but to generate Premium Reports you first need to subscribe to premium prospecting

Where to See the Prospects Generated?

- Look for the AI Recommended card — refreshed every 2–3 days
- A notification badge will alert as soon as you open Prospect Dashboard when new recommendations are ready
