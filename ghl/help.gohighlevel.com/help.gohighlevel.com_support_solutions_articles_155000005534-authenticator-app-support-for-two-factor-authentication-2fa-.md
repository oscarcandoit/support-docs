## **How To Set Up the Authenticator App for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. By setting up an authenticator app, you'll have the option to use it alongside your phone number and email for verifying your identity during login.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the Two-factor Authentication (2FA) App

Go to Agency settings → My Profile. Click on the Setup button to get started. Use your preferred authenticator app to scan the displayed QR code or manually enter the setup code provided.

**Step 2:**  Input the OTP from the authenticator app to finish the setup.

After scanning or manually entering the provided code into your authenticator app, you'll receive a one-time password (OTP). Click Next in HighLevel CRM, enter this OTP, and complete the setup.

**Step 3:** Save Backup Codes

Save the backup codes discreetly to access the system in case app access is lost. In case backup codes are lost or accessed by others, users can reset backup codes from My Profile.

```
Please Note: Upon your next login, select the authenticator app option for 2FA and authenticate using the generated OTP.
```

```
IMPORTANT:

1. Only primary logged in user will be able to set an authenticator app in his account. Admins will not be able to set authenticator app for other users by using “login as".

2. 10 backup codes will be generated at a time, each code can be used only once.

3. On Authenticator App, Name of the agency will be visible. The authenticator App will be setup for an user-agency combination.
