2. **Powerful word-of-mouth referrals**
3. **A growing, loyal customer base that continuously drives revenue**

## **What You’ll Learn in This Guide**

1. **Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking:** Set up systems to ensure customers remember you for their future electrical needs.

2. **Get More 5-Star Reviews Automatically:** Generate positive reviews that boost your online reputation and drive new leads.

3. **Create a Referral Machine:** Turn satisfied customers into your best salespeople with an automated referral program.

4. **Lock in Recurring Revenue with Maintenance Plans:** Offer subscription-based services for steady, predictable income.

5. **Use AI & Smart Lists to Boost Customer Engagement:** Leverage HighLevel’s AI tools and segmentation to re-engage past customers and prevent churn.

* * *

## **Step 1: Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking**

Many electricians lose potential repeat business by not following up after a job is completed. Without timely reminders, even very satisfied customers might forget about your services—and choose a competitor when the next need arises.

```
Fun Fact: 65% of customers forget who they hired after six months. Automated follow-ups ensure you’re always top-of-mind when they need you again.
```

### **1.1 Post-Service Follow-Up Messages**

Remind customers to schedule future services and offer a special discount for rebooking.

- Send an **automated thank-you SMS or email** after every job.

- Ask if everything is working well & remind them about future maintenance.

- Include a **special offer for their next service** to encourage rebooking.

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> _"Hey Mike, thanks for trusting \[Your Business Name\] for your electrical work! Everything running smoothly? Book a panel checkup in 6 months & get $50 off!_

```

```

### **1.2 Automated Check-In Reminders**

Prompt customers to book necessary follow-up services online.

- Set up **6-month and 12-month service reminders** for key electrical services (e.g., panel inspections, safety checks).

- Offer customers a quick way to **book their next appointment online.**

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Mike, it’s been 6 months since your last wiring inspection. Need us to stop by? Reply YES, and we’ll take care of it!"

```

## **Step 2: Get More 5-Star Reviews Automatically**

Positive reviews not only build trust but also boost your online rankings—leading to more calls and jobs. Studies show that businesses with 50+ reviews convert 270% more leads than those with fewer reviews.

### **2.1 Automate Review Requests**

After every job, trigger automated SMS and email guiding customers to leave a review on platforms like Google, Facebook, or Yelp.

- **Trigger SMS & email review requests** right after job completion.

- Personalize the request with the customer’s name and job details.

- Direct them to **Google, Facebook, and Yelp** to maximize visibility.

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Mike, thanks for trusting us! If we did a great job, could you leave us a quick review? It helps us a ton! Click here: \[Google Review Link\]"

```

```

### **2.2 Handle Negative Reviews Proactively**

Reach out immediately to dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and turn their experience around.

- **AI filters & flags** negative reviews before they go public.

- Customers with issues get an **instant response & a follow-up call** instead.

- **Turn unhappy customers into loyal clients** by resolving problems quickly.

* * *

## **Step 3: Create a Referral Machine**

Referral customers typically convert 5 times faster and spend 16% more than cold leads. Your happiest customers can be your most effective marketers when empowered with a structured referral system.

### **3.1 Set Up a Referral Program**

Develop an automated referral program that rewards both the referrer and the new customer, offering incentives such as discounts or service credits!

- Reward customers who **refer friends & family** with discounts or service credits.

- Offer an incentive to both the referrer & the new customer (e.g., **$50 off their next job**).

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Love working with us? Refer a friend & you BOTH get $50 off your next job! Just send them this link: \[Referral Link\]"

```

```

### **3.2 Automate Referral Follow-Ups**

Following each successful job, send a follow-up message encouraging referrals. HighLevel tracks these referrals and automatically applies the rewards, making it a seamless process.

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Mike, do you know someone who needs an electrician? Send them our way & we’ll give you BOTH $50 off!"

* * *

## **Step 4: Lock in Recurring Revenue with Maintenance Plans**

Offering subscription-based maintenance plans can generate up to 30% more repeat business, ensuring steady revenue and improved customer loyalty.

### **4.1 Offer Service Plans for Recurring Work**

Create monthly or annual service plans covering essential offerings and automate invoicing and renewal reminders for your customers!

- Create **monthly or annual plans** for safety inspections, surge protection checks, and breaker panel maintenance.

- Automate invoicing & renewal reminders so customers stay enrolled.

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Join our VIP Maintenance Plan: One annual inspection + priority service = $99/year. Save $$ & keep your home safe!"

```
Click here to learn How to Setup Subscription-Based Services
```

### **4.2 Upsell Preventative Maintenance During Jobs**

Encourage your team to suggest maintenance plans as part of every service call and offer on-the-spot discounts to drive sign-ups and secure recurring revenue.

- Train your team to **suggest maintenance plans** when completing a job.

- Offer a **small discount for signing up on the spot**.

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Mike, we just finished your wiring fix. Want to lock in an annual checkup? Sign up today & get $25 off!"

```

## **Step 5: Use AI & Smart Lists to Boost Customer Engagement**

Past customers are much more likely to return for future services than new prospects. By using HighLevel’s AI tools and smart segmentation, you can deliver personalized outreach that keeps your customers engaged and ready to rebook.

### **5.1 Smart Lists for Re-Engagement**

Segment your customer base by factors like job type, location, or spending habits, then target them with tailored promotions, seasonal offers, and rebooking reminders.

- Create lists of **past customers by job type, location, or spending**.

- Send **seasonal promotions, upgrade offers, and rebooking reminders**.

### **5.2 AI-Powered Follow-Ups & Surveys**

Leverage AI to send personalized follow-up messages and satisfaction surveys that not only check in with your customers but also preempt potential issues.

- Use AI to **check in with past customers via SMS**

- Send satisfaction surveys to **gather customer feedback & prevent churn**

> _**Example Message:**_
>
> "Hey \[First Name\], it’s been 6 months since your last visit. Need any electrical work done? Reply YES to book!"
