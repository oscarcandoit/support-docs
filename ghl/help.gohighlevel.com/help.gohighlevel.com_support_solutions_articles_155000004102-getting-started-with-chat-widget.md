# **What are Chat Widgets?**

The HighLevel Chat Widget is an embeddable messenger that lets website visitors start real‑time conversations with your team by Live Chat, Email/SMS, or WhatsApp—all routed directly into your HighLevel inbox.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Chat Widgets**

Chat widgets provide a range of benefits, especially for businesses looking to enhance customer engagement, improve support efficiency, and drive conversions. Here are some of the key advantages:

- **Real-Time Customer Support:** Users get instant answers to their questions, reducing wait times and improving the overall customer experience

- **Improved Customer Experience:** Faster Issues can be resolved immediately, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- **Increased Conversions:** Encourage interaction by offering help when customers need it, helping to prevent cart abandonment and increase conversion rates

- **Increased Engagement:** Proactively engage users based on behavior, such as spending a long time on a product page

- **Cost Savings:** Automating responses to common questions through a chatbot reduces the volume of queries that need human support, saving on labor costs

- **Increased Efficiency:** By handling multiple conversations at once, chat widgets improve support efficiency

* * *

## **Chat Type Options**

Chat Widget is provided in three options:

**1\. Email and SMS Chat**

This chat will collect the visitor’s information so that you can respond to them via SMS or email later. It is great for small teams that are not staffed 24x7 \[ [What is LC Email](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001220605-what-is-lc-email-) and [What is LC Phone](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223546-what-is-lc-phone-system-)\]

**2\. Live Chat**

Live chat is a real-time, 2 way conversation within the chat widget. Great for teams with 24x7 coverage or with Conversation AI installed.

**3.** **WhatsApp Chat**

A WhatsApp integrated 2 way conversation on chat widget. The user needs a Whatsapp approved number. It is also great for small teams that are not staffed 24x7

## **Using Conversation AI Within a Chat Widget**

Use Conversational AI directly inside the chat widget to greet visitors and deliver instant answers around the clock, so every inquiry receives a response even when your team is away.

For setup and advanced options, see [Conversational AI Bot Explained](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001335).
