# Issue: Old Whatsapp Voice Notes Appearing Blank in Conversations

Modified on: Fri, 28 Mar, 2025 at 5:49 AM

**Old Whatsapp Voice Notes Appearing Blank in Conversations**

We have identified an issue where old voice notes that were sent or received appear as blank messages in the conversation window.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044160036/original/jfgV6bfRZ_hx83c8GCUzJdf8tou54-A03g.png?1743158506)

**Solution:**

**Meta’s Media Retention Policy for Conversations**

Meta does not store media shared in conversations for more than 30 days. Once this period has passed, the media will no longer be visible in the conversation.

We understand the importance of transparency in media availability, and we are actively working on a feature to display this information in the user interface (UI) for better clarity. Stay tuned for updates as we enhance the user experience.
