# What do you need to know?

To send messages in the US, you **must register all 10DLC phone numbers**. As a result, AT&T and T-Mobile are **increasing the per-message rate on unregistered traffic to motivate unregistered senders to register**. If these numbers remain unregistered, they may be subject to **additional filtering or blocking**.

Some **carrier fees will be increased** on June 1, 2023, and others will be increased on August 1, 2023.

Most customers are observing significant savings and better deliverability by registering their 10DLC numbers.

# Upcoming carrier fee changes summary

# Why is this happening?

These changes align with the broader industry goals to create a fully registered and verified business messaging ecosystem in the U.S. to protect consumers from SPAM, bad actors, and unwanted messaging.
