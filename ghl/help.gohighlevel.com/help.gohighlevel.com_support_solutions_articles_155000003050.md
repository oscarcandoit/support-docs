# Ad Manager: Campaign budget definition

Modified on: Sun, 1 Dec, 2024 at 4:22 PM

In this article, we will be discussing about the budget definition process for an ad campaign in Ad Manager.

* * *

## **Understanding your campaign budget**

Campaign budgets for Facebook Ad campaigns are defined in the second step of the campaign setup flow. Once you enter the average amount that you want to spend on this ad campaign by selecting either daily or lifetime budget and launch your campaign, the amount specified will be charged from the card added to your connected Meta Ad account.

Select a budget for your Facebook Ad campaigns that aligns with your business needs. Take into account your ideal customer, the services you offer, and your vision for business or goals when determining your budget.

```
Note: The currency used by the connected Meta Ad account and timezone which is used by the sub-account will automatically be reflected for the budget definition.
```

Once you choose a budget and launch your campaign, it renews automatically each month. If you choose to end your ad campaign, go on to pause or delete the ad campaign.

```
Note: The best thing you can give a campaign is time. Let your campaign run for a few months so Ad Manager can learn about your Ads, audience and conversions. The more data, the better it can optimise and deliver results.
```

## **Setting daily budget**

When you define your daily budget, it refers to the daily average amount you wish to use to run this ad campaign. It means that on one day it could be more than defined and on other days it could be less than specified for a period of one week. The start date and time for this campaign will be the instance you publish the campaign on Ad Manager and the ad campaign is sent to Facebook for review.

Example: If you have specified your daily budget to be $1000, on one day Facebook might use $1100 as the campaign running cost and on other days of the weekly billing cycle it could be less than $1000.

In no way possible, the ad expense charged to you will exceed $7000. To have a detailed understanding on how Daily Budget works in Facebook, refer:

### **How to set daily budget for a campaign:**

1. ### Go to New Campaign

2. Navigate to **Budget and Audience**(Step 2) in the campaign creation flow.
3. In the Budget section, have the Daily toggle selected and enter the amount you wish to set as your daily ad budget.

4. User can add other details of Ad Campaign.
5. Click **Next** at the bottom to review your ad and budget.


```
Please Note:
```

1. ```
The daily budget amount of a campaign can be edited when the campaign is in 'Paused', 'Failed' or 'Draft' state. Once Published' or 'In Review', the budget amount cannot be altered.
```

2. ```
User cannot toggle between Daily to Lifetime or vice versa when a campaign is in 'Paused', 'Published' or 'In Review' state.
```

## **Setting lifetime budget**

Lifetime budget refers to the amount user is willing to spend over the entire period of an ad campaign. It can be useful if you don't want to exceed a certain amount of overall spend, and work best if you have flexibility on how much you want to spend each day.

### **How to set lifetime budget for a campaign:**

1. Go to New Campaign
2. Navigate to **Budget and Audience**(Step 2) in the campaign setup flow.
3. In the Budget section, have the Lifetime toggle selected and enter the amount you wish to set as your lifetime ad budget.
4. Use the date and time picker to select the start and end date of the ad campaign, the amount specified will be spread across this time period to be used as ad spend. The start and end date-time of campaign will be specified in the budget section in the local timezone of the sub-account.
