What's new?

Expanded Column View:

Previously, only 3 columns (such as name, email) were displayed. Now, all the columns of the form submissions are visible.

Dynamic Columns:

Users can now select, deselect, and reorder the columns to view the data in the order they prefer.

Copy Functionality:

Users can now copy phone numbers, emails, and also have the ability to redirect to URLs directly from the table.

How to use?
