We are thrilled to announce the launch of the SMS Verification feature for our Forms and Surveys module. This new functionality allows form and survey participants to verify their phone numbers directly within the form or survey, enhancing the integrity of the data collected and providing a more seamless user experience.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

- [What’s New?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003195-how-to-use-sms-verification-in-forms-and-surveys#What%E2%80%99s-New?)
- [How It Works](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003195-how-to-use-sms-verification-in-forms-and-surveys#How-It-Works)
- [Why This Feature?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003195-how-to-use-sms-verification-in-forms-and-surveys#Why-This-Feature?)

## **What’s New?**

- SMS Verification Button:
A “Verify Phone” button is now displayed next to the phone number input field in forms and surveys.
- Verification Code:
Users receive a unique verification code via SMS, which they need to enter into the form to confirm their phone number.
- Enhanced Data Accuracy:
This feature aims to minimize errors and fraudulent submissions by ensuring that the phone numbers collected are valid and accessible by the users.
- User-Friendly Process:
Designed to be intuitive, guiding users through the verification process smoothly.
- Verified Phone Field:
In addition to the phone verification feature, we’ve introduced a “Phone Verified” field in form and survey submissions. When a phone number is successfully verified, it will be marked as “Yes” under the “Phone Verified” field, allowing for easy identification of verified phone numbers.
- OTP Billing:
Please note that OTP messages will be billed based on standard messaging pricing.

## **How It Works**

- Users will enter their phone number in the designated field of a form or survey.
- Upon entering a valid phone number, the “Verify Phone” button will become visible.
- Clicking this button sends a verification code to the user’s phone via SMS.
- Users must enter this code back into the form or survey to verify their phone number.

## **Why This Feature?**

The introduction of SMS verification is a response to the need for higher data accuracy and reliability in forms and surveys. By ensuring phone numbers are verified, we can significantly reduce the chances of receiving inaccurate data, thus benefiting both the data collectors and the participants.
