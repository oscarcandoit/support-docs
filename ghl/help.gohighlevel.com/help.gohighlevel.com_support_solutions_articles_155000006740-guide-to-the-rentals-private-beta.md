#### **Overview**

Welcome to the **private beta of Rentals**, our new scheduling and booking system designed for businesses that manage rentals — whether it’s cars, equipment, properties, or other bookable assets. With Rentals, you can efficiently manage availability, inventory, pricing, and multi-day bookings in one seamless platform.

**Rentals** helps you:

- **Manage multi-day bookings** with flexible start and end dates.

- **Track inventory and variants** for each listing (e.g., car models, room types).

- **Automate pricing and discounts** for different durations, quantities, or seasons.

- **Prevent double-bookings** with external calendar sync.

- **Simplify operations** through a unified calendar and listing management experience.


We’re excited to have you onboard as one of the first users to shape the future of this product.

* * *

## **Who is this Beta for?**

This private beta is intended for agencies and users who manage rentals or asset-based businesses. If your operations involve items or spaces that can be booked for specific durations (hours, days, weeks, or months), Rentals is built for you.

By joining the beta, you’ll have early access to new features, provide feedback, and help us refine the experience for the broader release.

* * *

## **What's New in Rentals**

Rentals is built to handle the unique complexities of rental-based scheduling. Here’s what’s Rentals can do:

#### **Multi-Day Booking Support**

- Book assets across multiple hours, days, weeks, or months, with flexible duration and booking controls.

#### **Listings and Categories [(Help Guide)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000006573)**

- Create listings for your rentals with detailed information, organized categories, and status management.

- Use pricing rules for seasons, days of the week, hour of day, durations, or quantities. Automatically apply discounts for long-term or bulk bookings.

#### **Calendar View [(Help Guide)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000006641)**

- View all bookings visually using a modern, filterable calendar that supports day, week, and month views. Identify overlaps, blocked slots, and real-time availability.

#### **External Calendar Sync**

- Connect and sync bookings with third party platforms using Calendar Sync to ensure your availability is consistent across platforms.

#### **Centralized Global Settings [(Help Guide)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000006640)**

- Control business operating hours, booking defaults, payment preferences, and communication templates from one location.

#### **Built-in Payments and Invoicing**
