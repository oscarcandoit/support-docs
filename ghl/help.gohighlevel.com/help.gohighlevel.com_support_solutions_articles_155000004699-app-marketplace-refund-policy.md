# App Marketplace - Refund Policy

Modified on: Thu, 27 Feb, 2025 at 3:14 AM

Last Updated: 27 Feb, 2025

Welcome to the HighLevel App Marketplace (“Marketplace”). This Refund Policy (“Policy”) explains how we handle refund requests for:

1. Subscription-based Apps purchased through HighLevel Marketplace payments

2. One-time fee/Lifetime license Apps purchase through HighLevel Marketplace payments

3. Usage-based Apps purchased through HighLevel Marketplace payments

4. Apps That Process Payments Outside HighLevel


This Policy, along with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, governs your use of the Marketplace. By purchasing or using Apps through the Marketplace, you agree to be bound by this Policy

## 1\. Subscription-based Apps purchased through HighLevel Marketplace payments

1. Overview

   - Many Apps on the HighLevel App Marketplace are offered on a recurring subscription basis (e.g., monthly or yearly).
2. Refund Window

   - Initial Subscription Period: Unless otherwise specified by the developer, we offer a prorated refund only if you cancel within 3 days of the initial subscription purchase.

   - Free Trial Period: Some Apps offer a free trial period (e.g., 7 or 14 days) so users can test the App before committing to a paid subscription.

     1. During Free Trial: If you cancel during the free trial, no charges will be billed, and no refund is necessary.

     2. After Free Trial Ends: Once the free trial ends and you are moved to a paid subscription, no refunds will be granted for the initial billing cycle.

     3. Extraordinary Circumstances: In the rare event that the App is entirely non-functional (through no fault of your own or your infrastructure) immediately after the trial, you may contact HighLevel Support within 3 days of the initial payment to request a review. If approved, a partial refund or credit may be issued.
   - Renewals: Renewals are generally non-refundable once they are processed. To avoid being charged for the next renewal, you must cancel prior to the renewal date.
3. Prorated Refunds

   - If a prorated refund is granted, it may be subject to deduction of any payment-processing fees and/or usage charges incurred.
4. How to Request a Refund

   - You must open a support ticket through HighLevel Support within the specified refund window (or as specified by your App developer) to request a refund.

   - HighLevel may coordinate with the developer to resolve any issues and determine if a refund is applicable.
5. Exceptions



   - If you have violated the App’s terms of service, engaged in misuse of the product, or are otherwise ineligible under the developer’s policy, your refund request may be denied.

## 2\. One-time fee/Lifetime license Apps purchase through HighLevel Marketplace payments

1. Overview of One-Time Fees

   - Some Apps or developers charge a one-time fee for an asset, license, or feature upgrade. These purchases typically grant you permanent or long-term access to the purchased asset.
2. No ‘Return’ of Assets

   - One-time fees often involve delivering a product or asset that cannot be returned (e.g., digital content, downloadable templates, or other non-reversible purchases).
3. Refund Abuse Concerns

   - Due to the nature of digital assets, if a user receives the deliverable and later requests a refund, they could effectively gain these assets for free. Therefore, no refunds will be granted unless the product is deemed defective or non-functional upon delivery.
4. Defective or Non-functional Product

   - If the deliverable is defective or fails to perform as advertised, you must:

     1. Contact the developer’s support within 3 days of purchase.

     2. Provide proof of the defect or non-functionality.
   - The developer and HighLevel will investigate and may offer a fix or replacement. A refund will be considered only if the developer cannot fix or replace the defective product within a reasonable time frame (typically 3 business days).
5. Final Decision

   - The decision to issue a refund in one-time fee scenarios lies jointly with HighLevel and the developer. All decisions are final.

## 3\. Usage-based Apps purchased through HighLevel Marketplace payments

1. Overview of Usage-Based Apps

   - Some Apps on the Marketplace charge fees based on your usage (e.g., per transaction, per lead, per email sent). These fees are deducted from your HighLevel Wallet in real-time.
2. Developer Costs

   - In a usage-based model, the developer incurs direct costs each time the service is used. As such, once usage has occurred, refunds for that usage would result in losses that the developer cannot recover.
3. Refund Eligibility

   - Incorrect Billing or Errors: If you believe you were charged incorrectly (e.g., system error, double charge), you must contact support immediately (within 3 days of the charge) with evidence of the incorrect billing.

   - No Refund for Valid Usage: Usage charges that are legitimate and accurately tracked are non-refundable.
4. Dispute Resolution Process

   - If a dispute arises about usage or billing, you can open a ticket withHighLevel Support. We will work with the developer to review logs, usage data, and payment history.

   - If an error is found, we may offer a credit or refund for the overcharged amount.

   - If no error is found, the charges will stand.
5. Cancellation of Usage-Based Apps

   - You may stop using the App or remove it from your account at any time to stop incurring further charges. However, previously accrued usage charges remain due and are non-refundable.

## 4\. Apps That Process Payments Outside HighLevel

1. Overview

   - Some developers may choose to process payments for their Apps directly and outside of the HighLevel payment system. If an App’s listing indicates “External Payment Processing,” or the developer’s documentation directs you to a separate payment portal, you will be charged outside of the HighLevel billing platform.
2. Refund Requests

   - For these externally processed payments, HighLevel does not have access to or control over the payment transactions. Therefore, HighLevel cannot issue refunds on the developer’s behalf.

   - If you require a refund for an App that processes payments outside of HighLevel, you must contact the developer directly. The developer’s registered support email or contact form will be provided in the App listing or documentation.
3. Developer Policies

   - Each developer has their own refund or cancellation policy for external payments, which may differ from HighLevel’s guidelines. Be sure to review their terms carefully before purchasing.
4. HighLevel Support

   - While HighLevel may assist in relaying communication or providing a point of contact, we do not manage or enforce refunds for externally processed payments. HighLevel’s role is limited to listing the App in the Marketplace.

## General Provisions

1. Fraud and Abuse

   - If there is any indication of fraud, abuse, or other manipulative behavior, HighLevel and the developer reserve the right to deny a refund request, suspend your account, and/or take further legal action.
2. Changes to This Policy

   - We may update or modify this Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. When we do, we will post the revised Policy on the Marketplace and update the “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of the Marketplace constitutes acceptance of any changes.
3. Governing Law

   - This Policy will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in HighLevel’s Terms of Service.
4. Contact Us

   - If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, please reach out to HighLevel Support.
