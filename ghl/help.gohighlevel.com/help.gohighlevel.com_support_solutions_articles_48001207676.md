[1\. Share the first text message in the workflow once your leads opt-in:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001207676#1.-Attach-a-screenshot-of-the-first-text-message-in-the-workflow-once-your-leads-opt-in%3A)

[2\. Please provide the Web URL address](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001207676#2.-Please-provide-the-Web-URL-address-around-your-data-collection-methods%3A) where your leads opt in

### **1\. Share the first text message in the workflow once your leads opt-in:**

After you set up your workflow/campaign with the first message compliant according to the guidelines below

**For example:**

David, it's Kate from ABC Company. Thanks for opting in to receive SMS notifications. I just saved a time for you on Thursday, June 15, 2023, at 4:00 PM, and I'll see you then! If anything changes, just let me know. If you need to opt out, reply STOP.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48280796212/original/iarYbetzVySe_ptac3lfW82JUDWEz6O2oQ.png?1675993888)

**Examples of message violations:**

1\. Hello, my name is Crystelle, and I'm seeking to buy a few houses in the area. If you're interested, I'd like to make you an offer on 984 Michael Cv. Is there a price range at which you'd consider selling?

2\. Hello Zina. Do you own of1768 Woodtree Cir? Really wanna talk about it if you have time.

3\. Hey, this is Karan from the XXXXXXX Center. If you didn't finish signing up to get your Allowance Card, give us a call back ASAP: (800) 000-0000

6\. Last chance to receive January $5 coupon by joining XXXXXXX Salon Club by the end of the year 2022! [https://msgsndr.com/l/XXXXXXXX](https://msgsndr.com/l/XXXXXXXX)

### **2\. Please provide the Web URL address around your data collection methods:**

Provide the URL of the webpage where customers share their contact details and consent to receive SMS messaging from the business. The URL must direct us to the page that contains the opt-in form so we can confirm how the company gathers consent for SMS communication. **The website URL, terms and conditions and privacy page should show the business name to be consistent.**

This is the point at which you collect consumer data, and the consumer consents to receiving SMS messaging which should include the following:

1. **Program name** and/or a **description of the messages** that will be sent
2. **Organization** or **individual** being represented in the initial message
3. **Fee disclosure**
1. E.g. "Message and data rates may apply"
4. Service delivery **frequency** or recurring messages disclosure
1. E.g. "4 messages per month", "Message frequency varies", "1 message per login", etc
5. **Customer care** information
1. typically "Text HELP for help" or Help at XXX-XXX-XXXX) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)
6. **Opt-out** instructions
1. (typically "Text STOP to cancel") - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)
7. **Link to Privacy Policy** describing how end-user opt-in information will be used
8. **Link to Terms and Conditions** describing terms of service
9. Incorporate an optional checkbox that end-users must select to receive SMS messaging. The checkbox can not be pre-selected. The checkbox provides the end-user the ability to agree, or not agree, to receive SMS messaging

# **For the web form:**

### **Show** **a checkbox to ensure the lead gives consent when filling out the form**

It needs to be an **optional** checkbox for message consent.

Opt-in consent message and checkbox **must be separated from the T&C/Privacy Policy consent and checkbox**.

For the checkbox consent, you need to include the bolded part like the **type of messaging you are sending, frequency, and how to opt out** e.g.

I agree to receive **marketing** messaging from **COMPANY\_NAME** at the phone number provided above. I understand I will receive **2 messages a month**, **data rates may apply, Text HELP to 800-000-0000 for assistance, reply STOP to opt out**

Example:

Learn more about [Forbidden Message Categories for SMS and MMS in the US and Canada](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045004974-Forbidden-Message-Categories-for-SMS-and-MMS-in-the-US-and-Canada)

# **For the terms and Conditions page:**

In the terms and conditions, add these six bullet points.

Enclosed is a copy of the boilerplate terms of service covering minimum requirements from the carriers:

**{Program Name}**

1. **{Insert program description here; a brief description of the types of messages users can expect upon opting in.}**

2. You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Simply text "STOP" to the shortcode. Upon sending "STOP," we will confirm your unsubscribe status via SMS. Following this confirmation, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. To rejoin, sign up as you did initially, and we will resume sending SMS messages to you.

3. If you experience issues with the messaging program, reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or reach out directly to **{support email address or toll-free number}**.

4. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

5. As always, message and data rates may apply for messages sent to you from us and to us from you. Message frequency varies. For questions about your text plan or data plan, contact your wireless provider.

6. For privacy-related inquiries, please refer to our privacy policy: **{link to privacy policy}**.


# **For the privacy policy page:**

**In the privacy policy, remove all keywords such as 'share,' 'sell,' 'affiliate,' or 'third-party' that mention selling or sharing leads' information with a third party.**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026164330/original/mBeoYVqSjfwYMj9ZcZm1FGjthVGYaR4BHg.jpeg?1715892982)

**A compliant Privacy Policy must state:**

**"No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. Information sharing to subcontractors in support services, such as customer service is permitted. All other use case categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties."**

# Your Twilio subaccounts will be suspended due to non-compliant activities:

- High Error Rate
- High Opt-Out rates

## **High Error Rate**

A high error rate can be driven by one error code or by the sum of several collectively. ( [see the Error and Warning Dictionary for a full list of all possible Twilio REST API error codes](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors)).

## **High Opt-Out Rate**

A high opt-out rate is an indication of unwanted/unsolicited messaging.

Your targeted audience must be aware of what they are signing up for and your website/form must clearly state how their information will be used and they have to provide consent to it accordingly. For example, you can't obtain the consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party.

**Consent / Opt-in:**

Prior to sending the first message, you must obtain agreement from the message recipient to communicate with them - this is referred to as "consent", you must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the type you're going to send. You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow. Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party.

## **Lack of Sender Identification**

Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation. Such that the message recipient can immediately associate where/whom they have given consent to.

**Lack of Opt-Out Language**

The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following language: "Reply STOP to unsubscribe," or the equivalent using another standard opt-out keyword, such as STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, and QUIT.

Same or similar message sent across a large number of phone numbers

We do not permit spreading similar or identical messages across many phone numbers without appropriate business justification.

As a result,  we have restricted your ability to provision additional phone numbers. If you attempt to recycle phone numbers and further provision additional phone numbers, you will see an error message due to this restriction.

To appeal this decision, please respond to this email with the justification of your business use case requiring the same or similar messages across additional phone numbers.

### **Your Key Messaging Metrics**

Your messaging activity reflects consumer impacting and/or policy-violating content being sent.  Your opt-out and error rates have reached higher than acceptable levels.

A good opt-out rate is typically in the range of 0—0.3%

A good error rate is typically in the range of 0—6%
