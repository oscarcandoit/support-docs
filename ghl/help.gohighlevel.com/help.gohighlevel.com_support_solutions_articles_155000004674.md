# Configure & Connect Purchased Domains

Modified on: Thu, 24 Apr, 2025 at 9:56 AM

When you have purchased a domain in HighLevel (not when connecting a domain from outside HighLevel) you can manage the DNS records directly inside HighLevel.

## **What is Purchased Domain Configuration?**

Every domain has configuration settings (DNS). When the domain is purchased through HighLevel then HighLevel is also the domain registrar, so you can configure the domain without leaving HighLevel. You can add, edit, and remove the relevant DNS records (ex: CNAME).

* * *

## **Where is Purchased Domain Configuration?**

Navigate to Subaccount > Settings > Domains > Purchased Domains.

* * *

## **Configuration**

Click on Configure next to the Purchased Domain to open the settings. You can manage the domain in two ways:

1. **Add Record**(or edit existing record).

2. **Connect Domain** to something in the Sites section (ex: Website, Store, etc).

### **Configuration - DNS Records**

You can add and edit the following DNS records:

1. A
2. CNAME
3. AAAA
4. MX
5. TXT

```
You should only have one A record when pointing a root domain. Multiple A records for the same domain (e.g., yourdomain.com) can lead to DNS resolution conflicts, especially when the system attempts to auto-insert its required A record.
```

### **Configuration - Connect Domain**

Click Connect This Domain to attach the domain to one of the things you built in the Sites section, funnels, websites, stores, blogs, etc.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1: Can I use a purchased domain for multiple sites like a website and a funnel at the same time?**

No, a single root domain can only be connected to one site type (e.g., website, funnel, blog, or store) at a time. If you want to use the same domain for multiple purposes, it’s best to create and connect subdomains (like store.yourdomain.com or blog.yourdomain.com) for each type of content.

**Q2: What DNS records can I manage for a purchased domain inside HighLevel?**

When you purchase a domain through HighLevel, you gain full access to manage its DNS directly within the platform. You can add, edit, or delete A, CNAME, AAAA, MX, and TXT records—no need for an external registrar or third-party DNS tool.

**Q3: Do I need to verify the domain after purchasing it through HighLevel?**

No, domains purchased directly through HighLevel are automatically verified and ready for configuration. You can immediately begin managing DNS settings and connecting the domain to your funnels, websites, stores, or blogs.
