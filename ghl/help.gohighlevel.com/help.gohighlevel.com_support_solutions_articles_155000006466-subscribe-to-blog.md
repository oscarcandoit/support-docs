We’re excited to introduce the **Subscribe to Blog** feature that helps you turn your readers into loyal subscribers directly from your blog. With a simple drag-and-drop form, you can start collecting email subscribers, grow your audience, and automate blog updates via email campaigns.

# What’s New

- **Drag & Drop Form** – Add a subscription form anywhere on your blog page.

- **Custom Styling** – Change titles, descriptions, fonts, button text, and colors.

- **Layout Options** – Choose between Plain or With Image layout.

- **Automatic Contact Creation** – Each submission is automatically saved as a contact in CRM.

- **Smart Tagging** – Subscribers get tagged (e.g., “Blog”) so you can target them in email campaigns


# How It Works

### **Step 1:** Open Your Blog Site Editor

1. Go to **Sites**.

2. Select your **Blog Site**.

3. Click on **Blog Builder → Site Editor**.


This opens the page editor where you can add and customize blog elements.

### **Step 2:** Add Subscribe Form

1. In the editor, drag and drop the **Subscribe form** element onto your blog page.

### **Step 3:** Customize the Form

- Edit the **Title** (e.g., “Subscribe to Our Blog”).

- Add a **Description** (e.g., “Get the latest posts delivered straight to your inbox”).

- Customize **Button Text** (e.g., “Subscribe Now”).

- Choose your preferred **layout** (Plain / With Image).

- Adjust **fonts, colors, and spacing** to match your site style.

### **Step 4:** Publish Your Blog Page

Once the form looks the way you want, click **Publish** to make it live. Visitors can now enter their email and subscribe directly from your blog.

### **Step 5:** Start sending email campaigns via tags

- Every new subscriber is automatically created as a **Contact** in your CRM.

- A **Blog Tag** is applied to them so you can easily identify and target blog subscribers later.

# Automate Blog Updates with Tags & Email Campaigns

You can make sure that subscribers automatically receive your new blog posts by setting up a workflow + email campaign.

### **Step 1:** Create Email Campaign with Blog RSS

1. Go to **Email Campaigns**.

Add **RSS Header** and **RSS Items** elements to the email body.

- **RSS Header** shows the blog’s title/summary.

- **RSS Items** display the list of new blog posts.

* * *

### **Step 3:** Configure Campaign & Recipients

1. When scheduling the campaign, select **RSS Schedule** so it automatically pulls in your latest blog posts.

1. Under **Recipients**, choose **Contacts from Tag → Blog**.

2. Save the campaign. _![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054902121/original/2LL42q8VNKV5i_k1Dv-RqyNQmzd4rGPLKw.png?1759226474)_


Now, every time someone subscribes, they’ll automatically receive your new blog posts in their inbox.

# Why It Matters

- **Effortless Lead Capture** – Turn casual blog readers into subscribers.

- **Grow Your Email List** – Build your audience without extra effort.

- **Automated Campaigns** – Keep subscribers engaged with the latest posts.

- **Targeted Marketing** – Use tags to create segmented campaigns for better results.


# FAQs

**Q1. Can I add more than one Subscribe Form on my blog?**

Yes. You can drag and drop multiple forms (e.g., one in the sidebar, one in the footer). All subscriptions will still create contacts in your CRM with the same tag.

**Q2. Where do my subscribers go after they sign up?**

All subscribers are automatically saved in your **CRM Contacts** with the tag you assign.

**Q3. Can I customize the button text and design?**

Absolutely. You can edit the button text, font, color, and layout directly in the Site Editor.

**Q4. What happens if I don’t set up an email campaign?**

Subscribers will still be collected in your CRM, but they won’t receive automatic blog updates. You’ll need to manually send emails or set up the RSS campaign.

**Q5. Can subscribers unsubscribe later?**

Currently, we do not support Unsubscribe functionality for users

**Q6. Will this affect my SEO?**

No. The Subscribe form is just a front-end element and does not affect your blog’s SEO.
