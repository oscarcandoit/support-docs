# Getting Started - Connect Stripe

Modified on: Fri, 30 May, 2025 at 6:59 PM

Ready to simplify your transactions? Stripe integration makes accepting credit card payments, subscriptions, and more straightforward and secure. Let's walk through setting it up together!

* * *

## **Connect Stripe**

First, head over to your Payments section. This is where all the magic happens—integrating payment gateways to streamline your customer transactions.

1. Navigate to **Payments > Integrations**. Here, you'll find popular options like Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, NMI, Manual Payment Methods (ex: cash on delivery, COD), and Square.

2. Click **Connect with Stripe**. This will direct you to securely log in or create your Stripe account if you haven't done so already.

3. Finally, **authorize your Stripe account**. This step ensures everything syncs smoothly and securely. When the integration is finished you can click **Manage** to edit the connection.

Awesome job! Now your payments are ready to roll.

- Explore how to connect Stripe at the sub-account level for more tailored control.
- Learn how to import products and pricing directly from Stripe to save you time.
