## Overview

The **Funnel/Website PageView** trigger allows users to automate actions when a contact views a specific page on a funnel or website. By tracking these page views, you can trigger various automations based on page-specific behavior, such as sending a follow-up email or tagging a contact based on their interaction with your content.

## Trigger Name

**Funnel/Website PageView**

## Trigger Description

This trigger activates when a contact visits a specified funnel or website page. It helps to automate actions based on which pages your leads or customers are visiting, allowing for personalized follow-up or specific actions to be executed.

## How to Configure

- **Select Trigger**: Start by choosing the _Funnel/Website PageView_ trigger from the list of available triggers in the workflow builder.

- **Assign a Name**: Set a meaningful name for the trigger such as "Funnel Page Visit - Checkout."

- **Filters**:

  - **Funnel/Website**: Select the specific funnel or website you want to monitor.
  - **Page**: Optionally, specify the exact page you want to track.
  - **UTM Parameters**: Set filters like UTM Campaign, Source, or Medium to refine the page view conditions.
- **Add Multiple Filters**: You can add additional filters to monitor specific pages, paths, or UTM campaigns as needed by clicking on **Add filters**.


## Example

**Scenario**: You want to track when visitors reach the “Checkout” page of your funnel and then send them a follow-up email if they abandon their cart.

- **Trigger**: Funnel/Website PageView
- **Funnel/Website**: Funnel Name (e.g., Bookkeeper Funnel)
- **Page**: Is equal to “Checkout”
- **Action**: Send a follow-up email offering assistance after a specific amount of time if no purchase is completed.

This setup allows you to re-engage customers who might have dropped off at the final stage of purchasing.
