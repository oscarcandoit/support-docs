# **Mentioning and Tagging Profiles in Posts from the Social Planner**

The Social Planner now allows users to add @Mentions in posts! @Mentions will work for socials like Facebook, LinkedIn (Only company pages) and plain text will be available Instagram, Tiktok and GMB. @Mentions will be the search for public profiles or pages.

If more than one social channel is used, it will ask to customise the post for each channel to be enabled to allow users to search by the name, followers and social wise.

## **Key Benefits of Tagging and Mention Profiles**

- Improves Post engagement for customers

- Brands and influencers often use @Mentions strategically to cross-promote each other's content

- On some platforms, @Mentions contribute to the searchability of content

* * *

## **Key Information**

- This will not work in CSV and other options like Review Posting, RSS Posting.

- The tag will appear highlighted (in blue) in the preview. This visual highlight confirms that the tag was recognized successfully by the system.

- **Auto-suggestions for mentions are not available for Instagram**. You’ll need to type @username manually, and the person being tagged must have their settings enabled to allow mentions.
