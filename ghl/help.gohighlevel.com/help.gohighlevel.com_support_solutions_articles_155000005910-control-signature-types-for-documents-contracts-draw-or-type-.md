# Control Signature Types for Documents & Contracts (Draw or Type)

Modified on: Mon, 11 Aug, 2025 at 4:38 PM

Control how recipients sign your Documents & Contracts by allowing Draw, Type, or Both. Setting up this control keeps the signer experience consistent, reduces confusion and helps teams meet policy or regulatory requirements across every document you send.

# **What are Signature Types?**

Signature types define the methods a recipient can use to apply their signature to a document sent from HighLevel. Choosing which methods are allowed (Draw, Type, or Both) shapes the signer experience and ensures it aligns with your brand and compliance needs. This is a global, sub-account level control, meaning your changes apply to all documents sent from the sub-account.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Signature Type Control**

Signature type control allows you to select a configuration that balances compliance, brand control and convenience:

- **Compliance:** Meet hand‑drawn requirements by disabling typed signatures when regulations or policies demand a handwritten‑style mark

- **Consistency:** Provide a uniform signer experience across all documents sent out

- **Speed:** Allow typed signatures for faster turnaround when permitted

- **Administrative Control:** Manage signer methods centrally without the need for per‑document toggles


* * *

## **Signature Type Options**

- **Draw Signatures:** Restricts signers to a hand‑drawn signature

- **Type Signature:** Restricts signers to typing their name, rendered in a script font

- **Both:** Offers maximum flexibility; signers can choose either method

- In the main left-side navigation bar, select **Payments**

- Click the **Documents & Contracts** tab in the upper navigation ribbon

- Select the **Settings** button in the upper right corner

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is this setting global or per-document?**

It’s configured globally for the sub‑account in Document Settings and applies to all documents sent from that sub‑account.

**Q: If I change the setting after sending a document, what happens?**

A: New or refreshed signing sessions reflect the latest setting. If someone already has the document open, ask them to refresh before signing and signature options will update to reflect the change in settings.

**Q: Does the chosen method affect audit trail, status, or automations?**

No. Tracking (viewed/signed/completed) and workflow triggers function the same regardless of whether the signer draws or types.
