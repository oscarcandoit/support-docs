# Snapshot Management: Selective Asset Snapshots and Force Snapshot Creation

Modified on: Thu, 24 Apr, 2025 at 8:45 AM

This article shows you how to use HighLevel’s enhanced snapshot management tools to selectively create and refresh snapshots, or force-create them even if some assets fail to load. These updates help you save time, avoid errors, and get more control over your sub-account data.

# **What is Snapshot Management?**

Snapshot Management lets you capture and reuse sub-account configurations—such as workflows, funnels, emails, and more—across other accounts. With the enhanced features, you can now choose exactly which assets to include in your snapshots, refresh only specific parts, and bypass asset loading errors when necessary.

## **Key Benefits of Enhanced Snapshot Management**

HighLevel’s new snapshot enhancements focus on control, reliability, and efficiency. Here’s what makes these features a must-use for teams managing multiple sub-accounts:

- **Selective asset inclusion** helps you create lean, focused snapshots tailored to your use case.

- **Selective snapshot refresh** reduces processing time by updating only the assets you want.

- **Force snapshot creation** ensures your work isn’t blocked due to temporary asset load errors.

- **Refined asset selection UI** makes picking what to include faster and more intuitive.

- **Smarter error handling** keeps operations flowing with clear system prompts.

- **Optimized productivity** through less manual cleanup and fewer failed snapshot attempts.


## **How to Create a New Snapshot with Selective Assets**

Capture exactly what you need from a sub-account using the selective snapshot tool.

1. **Go to Account Snapshots**: In the main menu, select **Account Snapshots**.

2. **Click Create New Snapshot**.

3. **Name Your Snapshot**: Enter a descriptive title for the snapshot.

4. **Select Sub-Account**: Use the dropdown to choose which sub-account the snapshot should pull from.

5. **Choose Assets to Include**:

   - You’ll see a list of all assets in the selected sub-account.

   - Check the boxes next to the items you want to include.

   - You can select all, or only specific workflows, funnels, emails, etc.
6. **Click Create** to save the snapshot.


## **How to Refresh an Existing Snapshot Selectively**

Update an existing snapshot with only the changes you need—no full reset required.

1. **Locate the Snapshot**: Go to **Account Snapshots** and find the one you want to update.

2. **Click the Refresh Icon**: A refresh symbol appears next to each snapshot.

3. **Modify Asset Selection**:

   - You’ll see a list of currently included assets (pre-selected).

   - Add or remove assets to match what needs updating.
4. **Click Refresh** to apply your changes.


## **How Force Snapshot Creation Works**

Don’t let a temporary error block your snapshot. Force-create it to keep your momentum.

- If the system detects a failure while loading certain assets, a warning will appear.

- You’ll have the option to **Force Create Snapshot**.

- All assets that were successfully loaded will be saved in the snapshot.

- A summary report will list any skipped assets so you can follow up later if needed.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I select no assets during snapshot creation?**

The snapshot will be created, but it won’t contain any assets. You’ll need to refresh it later to include content.

**Q: Can I edit the contents of a snapshot later?**

You can refresh an existing snapshot to include or exclude different assets, but you cannot modify a snapshot’s content directly.

**Q: Does using force snapshot creation risk losing data?**

No. Assets that cannot be loaded are skipped—not deleted—and you can retry them in a future refresh or snapshot.

**Q: Will I see which assets were skipped during force creation?**

Yes, a list of skipped or failed-to-load assets will be presented after the snapshot is created.

**Q: Can I force refresh a snapshot too?**

No, force snapshot creation is only available during the **initial** creation, not during refresh.

### **Next Steps**

- Review your current snapshots and identify opportunities to use the selective refresh.

- Test the force snapshot creation feature in a high-volume sub-account.

- Stay tuned for upcoming enhancements like **asynchronous asset retrieval**, which will make working with large sub-accounts even faster and more reliable.
