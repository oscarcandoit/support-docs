### Let's Grow Together!

Here's the scoop...

The HighLevel affiliate program pays out a 40% monthly recurring commission for every paying agency customer you send us (we call this a "Tier 1" affiliate). Additionally, HighLevel pays out an additional 5% monthly recurring commission for every paying agency signed up by an agency that you signed up (we call this a "Tier 2" affiliate).

So if you send us an agency customer who goes on the Agency Unlimited plan at $297/month, we'll send you $118.80 every month they remain a customer!

> The HighLevel Affiliate Program is an incredible way for marketing agencies to open up a new revenue stream that's basically 100% margin.
>
> \- Shaun Clark, CEO HighLevel
