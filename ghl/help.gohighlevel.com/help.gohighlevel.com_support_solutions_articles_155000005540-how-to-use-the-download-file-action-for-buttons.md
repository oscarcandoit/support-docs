# **What is the Download File Action?**

The Download File action lets users download a file (PDF, image, ZIP, etc.) when they click a Button, Image, or SVG element on your funnel or website. This is ideal for lead magnets, brochures, or digital assets you want to offer instantly—no code required!

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Download File Action**

Make user interactions more powerful and seamless with simple downloads.

- Instantly offer downloadable files like eBooks, images, or templates

- Eliminate the need for external download services

- Works across buttons, image elements, and SVG graphics

- Easy one-click setup with no technical expertise needed

- Customize file names to align with your branding

- Boost user engagement by delivering value quickly


* * *

## **How To Enable the Download File Action**

Follow these steps to enable the feature and attach your file.

1. Open your funnel or website in the editor.

2. Select the **Button**, **Image**, or **SVG** element.

3. In the right-hand settings panel, toggle **“Download”** ON.

4. Click **“Link File”** to open the **Media Picker**.

## **Supported Elements for File Download**

The feature is built to work across the most commonly used visual elements.

- **Buttons**: Great for CTA-based downloads like “Download Now.”

- **Images**: Make an image (e.g., icon, poster) clickable for download.

- **SVGs**: Enable custom graphics to trigger a download.


* * *

## **Customizing the Downloaded File Name**

Personalize the file download name for brand consistency or clarity.

When linking a file, you’ll have the option to:

- Rename the file for the end user (e.g., from “file\_123.pdf” to “2025\_Pricing\_Guide.pdf”).

- Avoid technical or confusing filenames for better professionalism.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I add more than one download to a button?**

No. Each element can only be linked to a single downloadable file.

**Q: What file types are supported?**

Any file stored in the Media Library, including PDFs, images, ZIPs, and more.

**Q: Can I track who downloads my files?**

Currently, downloads aren’t tracked individually. Consider using automation triggers with form submissions for tracking.

**Q: Do users see a preview or direct download?**

Files are directly downloaded when the element is clicked, not previewed.
