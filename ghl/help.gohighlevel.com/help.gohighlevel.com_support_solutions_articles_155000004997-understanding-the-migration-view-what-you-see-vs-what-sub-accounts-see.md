# Understanding the Migration View: What You See vs. What Sub-Accounts See

Modified on: Tue, 16 Sep, 2025 at 7:23 AM

As an agency owner, you're seeing the **full suite of migration options** inside the WordPress Hosting dashboard. This includes access to our premium **White-Glove Migration Assistance**— a service exclusively available to agencies.

### What You See (Agency View)

You’ll see all three migration options:

1. **Effortless Migration with our Plugin**

One-click, fast migration via the LeadConnector Plugin.

2. **Manual Migration Made Simple**

Use the All-in-One Migration plugin to upload your `.wpress` file.

3. **White-Glove Migration Assistance** _(Agency-only)_

Submit a form to have our WordPress specialists handle the migration for you.


✅ These options are visible **only to you**, not to your clients or their sub-accounts.

### Migration guide for Agencies: [https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005010-wordpress-hosting-step-by-step-migration-guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005010-wordpress-hosting-step-by-step-migration-guide)  Contact Support for Agencies: [https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/home](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/home)

### What Your Sub-Accounts See

Your sub-accounts will **only see the two standard migration options**:

1. **Effortless Migration with our Plugin**

2. **Manual Migration Made Simple**


They **will not see** the White-Glove Migration Assistance option.

They also do not see any labels or indicators revealing that there are features they are missing.

This ensures your **white-label experience remains intact**, and your clients won't know about the behind-the-scenes support available to you as an agency.

### Migration Guide for Subaccounts: [https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005159-wordpress-hosting-step-by-step-migration-guide](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005159-wordpress-hosting-step-by-step-migration-guide)

### Why the Difference?

The **White-Glove Migration** feature is a premium benefit tailored for agency-level control and flexibility. Allowing only agency owners to access it prevents confusion for sub-accounts and protects your brand's white-label offering.

### Need to Guide a Sub-Account?

If you’re guiding a client through migration:

- You can recommend the **plugin-based migration** for simplicity.

- Or handle the entire migration yourself using the **White-Glove option** on their behalf.
