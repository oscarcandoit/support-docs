### **Overview**

If/Else action is one of the most powerful action that gives users a lot of flexibility in workflows. We have made significant changes in the action to make it more powerful and user friendly.

### **Upgrades**

#### Introducing Scenario Recipes

- We’ve completely reimagined how you set up your If/Else conditions by introducing Scenario Recipes. These are pre-built templates that simplify the setup process:



- Select from one of our pre built recipes just for If/Else.
- Click the dropdown and select from the 10 recipe types we have or build your own.
- These recipes will also tell you if there are any pre requisites you want to add before using these recipes.

#### Enhanced Branch Functionality

- The If/Else branches in the builder have also gone through a major upgrade.



- You can now see a concise text summary of each branch, making it easier to understand at a glance which conditions are being met.
- For branches with multiple conditions, simply click "+x more conditions" to view a full list in a convenient pop-up window.
- Clicking on any branch will isolate it for editing while collapsing others, so you can focus on one branch at a time.

#### "Time of the Day" condition

- In the "Current Hour" condition type user was only able to select the hour options.
- We have added a new option in "Date - Time" condition and that is "Time of the Day"
- This allows users to select specific times down to 15-minute intervals, offering more granular control.
- For simplifying, we show descriptions of selected values to indicate in what situation those will be true

#### UI Upgrade

- Enjoy a refreshed UI for the If/Else action, making it more user-friendly.
- The Branch Configuration screen has been streamlined.
- The new Condition Dropdown makes it easier to search and select specific conditions.
- Also now user can simply drag and drop branches to re-arrange them in UI
