# Listing Conversation AI and Voice AI Templates on the Marketplace

Modified on: Thu, 19 Jun, 2025 at 4:54 AM

1. **Generate a Marketplace Link**

   - On HighLevel, in the **Conversation AI** or **Voice AI** page, select the agent and click **Sell this Template/Agent on Marketplace** (This option is **visible only to Agency Owners and Admins**. Sub-account admins and users cannot view this option)

   - You can also multi-select agents and build a template with a team of agents.

   - The template will not only include the prompts, but also the actions such as triggering a workflow, creating an appointment, along with the underlying assets - workflows, calendar, custom field/value, etc. So you're selling the whole package.

     - Please ensure that the assets you're packaging are not imported as part of an IP protected snapshot. Restricted/IP protected assets cannot be included in the AI agents.
   - You’ll be redirected to the Developer Portal with a special link that carries your bot’s package.

   - If you wish to update your existing template listed on the marketplace, you can make the necessary changes in the Conversation AI or Voice AI page, click on **Copy Link for Marketplace** from the menu, and update the link in the **[Developer portal](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/apps)** (refer to #2 below)
2. **Complete Your App Details**

   - In the [**Developer Portal**](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/apps) under **Modules → ConversationAI or Voice AI**, paste your link and click **Submit** to fetch.

   - **Editable fields**: Use-cases (e.g. lead qualification, appointment booking), Agent Description and available actions (workflows, appointments, SMS blasts, call transfers)

   - You can also configure the list of **suggested questions** that buyers can ask the agent while they are testing your agent on the Marketplace before purchasing your agent.

   - **Review non-editable fields**: supported channels (SMS, email, Instagram, calls)
3. **Finalise & Submit**

   - Fill out your **app's Basic Info, App Profile**, **[Pricing](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001217-set-up-your-app-pricing)**, and **Support** sections.

   - Submit your listing for review—once approved, it goes live in the Marketplace for all agency users and sub-accounts.
