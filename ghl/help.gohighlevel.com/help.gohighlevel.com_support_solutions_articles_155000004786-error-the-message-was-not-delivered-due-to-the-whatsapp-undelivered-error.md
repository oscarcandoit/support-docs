When a WhatsApp message fails with a reason **Message Undeliverable** it is due to the following reason

1. Phone number doesn't have WhatsApp (If you receive a message undelivered error while sending a WhatsApp message, then first you can check if the contact number has WhatsApp activated in it or not. To check that, you can use this link: [https://2chat.co/tools/whatsapp-checker](https://2chat.co/tools/whatsapp-checker).)

2. **Marketing template limit**
1. Short Explanation - The User has reached the maximum marketing template in a certain period.

2. Long Explanation - To create high-quality user experiences and maximize marketing template message engagement. This may include limiting the number of marketing template messages a person receives from any business in a given period of time, starting with a small number of conversations that are less likely to be read. Note that the limit is determined based on the number of marketing template messages that a person has already received from any business and is not related to your business specifically.
