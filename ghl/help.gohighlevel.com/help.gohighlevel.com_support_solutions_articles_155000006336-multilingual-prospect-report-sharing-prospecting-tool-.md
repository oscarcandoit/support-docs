# **What is Multilingual Prospect Report Sharing?**

Multilingual Prospect Report Sharing localizes the web version of the Marketing Audit Report in the Prospecting Tool. Agencies and Sub-Accounts can select a language when generating a share link (or sending via Email/SMS), and prospects can also change the language from a dropdown on the report page.

This improves clarity for non-English audiences and strengthens their engagement. Multilingual Prospect Report Sharing works from both the agency and sub-account level!

```
Note: Multilingual Prospect Report Sharing is available for web-reports only (not for PDF exports).
```

2. Click **Share Report**.

3. Choose your channel: **Email**, **SMS**, or **Share Link**.

4. Set **Select Report Language** to the language you want the recipient to see first.

5. Complete sending details then send the report or copy and share the link.

## **Prospect-Side Language Switching**

Allow prospects to switch languages themselves on the web report so teams with different preferences can view insights comfortably.

1. Open the shared web report link.

2. At the top-right of the page, select a language from the dropdown.

3. The report updates immediately in the chosen language.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does this work on PDF exports?**

Not yet. Multilingual support currently applies to web reports. Multi-language support for PDFs is planned.

**Q: Can I change the language after I’ve already sent the link?**

The recipient can change languages on the public report using the language dropdown without needing a new link.

**Q: Which parts of the report are translated?**

System labels and UI text are localized. **Business data you enter** (e.g., names, addresses, custom notes) remains as entered.

**Q: Do Email/SMS messages get translated automatically?**

No. The report is localized; your email/SMS copy is not. Write the message in the recipient’s preferred language.

**Q: Is this available at both Agency and Sub-Account levels?**

Yes. You can select the report language when sharing from either level.

**Q: What happens if I’m unsure of the recipient’s language?**

Choose the most likely language at share-time and note that the viewer can switch languages on the report page.
