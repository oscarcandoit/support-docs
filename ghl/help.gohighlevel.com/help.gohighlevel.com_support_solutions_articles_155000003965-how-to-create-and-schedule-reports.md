Custom Reports allow you to build and schedule tailored reports, perfect for sharing insights and data with your team or clients. Whether you start from scratch or convert an existing dashboard, this feature gives you full control over your report’s design, content, and scheduling. Here's how to make the most of it.

* * *

```
Important: All plans ($97, $297 and $497) Sub Accounts now have access to multiple dashboards and fully customizable reports
```

```
When using the custom report builder, keep in mind how timezones affect the data:

Report Builder Date Range: The data shown in the builder uses the timezone set in your browser.
Email Preview: The scheduled email preview uses the sub-account's timezone.
Google and Facebook Ads Data: For third-party integrations like Google Ads and Facebook Ads, the data is based on the timezone configured in those ad accounts, not the sub-account timezone.
```

* * *

### **Step 1: Access Custom Reports:**

- Navigate to the "Reporting" section and click on Custom Reports.

- Select New Report to start building your report.
