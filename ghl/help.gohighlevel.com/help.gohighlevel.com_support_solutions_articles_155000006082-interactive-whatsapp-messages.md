# **What are Interactive WhatsApp Messages?**

HighLevel supports **Interactive WhatsApp Messages** directly inside the Automation module. A new action called WhatsApp Interactive Messages makes it easy to send rich, interactive experiences to your customers on WhatsApp. With this feature, you can send:

- **Interactive Reply Buttons** – Up to 3 quick-reply buttons your users can tap.

- **Location Messages** – Send a map location with latitude and longitude.

- **Contact Messages** – Send rich contact cards with names, phone numbers, addresses, and emails.

- **List Messages** – Present structured menus with multiple sections and rows.


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Interactive WhatsApp Messages**

The points below explain the practical advantages you’ll gain by using interactive WhatsApp Messages within your workflows.

- **Higher Reply Rates:** Contacts answer faster because responding is a single tap, no need to type.

- **Cleaner CRM Data:** Choices are standardized, cutting typos and mismatches so reporting stays accurate.

- **Lower Messaging Costs:** Window-aware sending helps you avoid unnecessary spend.

- **More Conversions:** Direct calls-to-action move contacts to booking, checkout, or payment with less friction.

- **Fewer Mistakes and Misunderstandings:** Predefined options minimize typos and ambiguity, so conversations stay accurate and on track.


* * *

## **Prerequisites: Customer Service Window**

Before you send Interactive WhatsApp Messages, you must ensure the **WhatsApp 24-hour Customer Service Window** is open.

When a WhatsApp user sends your business a message, a 24-hour Customer Service Window begins. During this window:

- You can send unlimited Interactive WhatsApp messages at no cost.

- There are no restrictions on free-form messaging.


[Click here to learn more about WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003235-whatsapp-customer-service-window-check)

### **How to Check or Trigger the Customer Service Window**

You have two options in Automations:

#### **Option 1:** Use the Customer Replied Trigger (WhatsApp)

The Customer Replied via WhatsApp trigger ensures the workflow only starts when the customer sends a WhatsApp message, which automatically opens the 24-hour window. Use the information below to configure this trigger:

- **Workflow Trigger:** Customer Replied

- **Filters:** Set Reply Channel = WhatsApp

#### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052286891/original/3p45ZiR6nSp7HO_6m0HuAiT8noU3aMYSXw.png?1756120926)    **Option 2:** Use the WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check Action

Use the _WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check_ action to evaluate whether the 24‑hour window is open before sending your interactive message. Use the information below to configure this action:

- **Action Name:** WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check

- _**CONVERSATION PHONE NUMBER**:_ Choose the WhatsApp number you’re sending from.

- Configure Branches:




  - _**Branch Name**: Open – Condition: Customer Service Window is Open_

  - _**Branch Name**: Closed – Condition: Customer Service Window is Closed_

```
Important: If the window is closed, you must send a Marketing or Utility Template message to reopen the conversation.
```

## **Interactive Call-to-Action (Visit Website) URL Button Messages**

WhatsApp users may be hesitant to tap long or complex URLs in plain text messages. **Interactive CTA URL Button Messages** solve this by mapping any URL to a clean, tappable button — creating a smoother and more trustworthy experience. When tapped, the button opens the specified URL in the user’s default browser.

Here is how you configure Interactive Contact Messages:

#### **Step 1:** Choose the Interactive Message Type

- Set I **NTERACTIVE MESSAGE TYPE** = **Visit Website Button.**

#### **Step 2:** Fill Out the Required Fields

Complete the required fields:

- **HEADER TYPE** – Choose from **Text, Image, Video, or Document**.

- **HEADER TEXT OR MEDIA URL** – Provide the header text or media link.

- **BODY** – Enter the main message body (max 1024 characters).

- **FOOTER** – Optional short supporting text (max 60 characters).

- **URL** – Enter the destination URL.

- **BUTTON TEXT** – Enter the text that will appear on the button (max 20 characters).

- **TIMEOUT UNIT & VALUE** – Choose Minutes, Hours, or Days (allowed range: 5 minutes – 2 days).


Save and test with a sample contact to confirm the button displays correctly and links open in the browser.

## **Example URL with CRM Variables**

You can dynamically personalize URLs by embedding **CRM fields**, including **contact fields** and **custom values**.

Example:

```
https://www.google.com/?name={{contact.name}}&calendar={{custom_values.agent_calendar}}
```

In this example:

- `{{contact.name}}` will dynamically insert the contact’s name.

- `{{custom_values.agent_calendar}}` will insert the assigned agent’s calendar link.


This lets you build personalized booking links, payment URLs, or campaign landing pages.

* * *

## **Example Button Setup in Workflow**

- **HEADER (Text)**: _Workshop Details_

- **BODY**: _Tap below to book your slot._

- **FOOTER**: _Spots are limited._

- **URL**: `https://mybusiness.com/booking?name={{contact.name}}`

- **BUTTON TEXT**: _Book Now_

- **TIMEOUT VALUE**: 30 Minutes


**Result:** Each customer sees a unique button linking to their personalized booking page.

* * *

## **Branching & Workflow Behavior**

You can branch workflows based on the button’s delivery and interaction:

- **Link Opened** – Trigger when the link is successfully opened.

- **Not Delivered** – Trigger if the message fails to deliver.

- **Timeout** – Trigger if the message expires without interaction.


This allows you to automate follow-up actions based on whether customers engage with the link.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057873995/original/2mqJTecLKybuHkZCCqGIFC0vY3t1Q_LIfA.png?1762550749)

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- Always use **trusted or branded URLs** for better click-through rates.

- Use CRM variables to reduce friction (e.g. pre-fill forms or auto-assign calendars).

- Combine with **Customer Service Window Check** to ensure the message is sent during an open session.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do Interactive WhatsApp Messages cost extra?**

No. As long as the 24-hour Customer Service Window is open, Interactive WhatsApp Messages are free. Meta does not charge for service conversations.

**Q: What happens if I try to send an Interactive Message outside the 24-hour window?**

If the Customer Service Window is closed, you must send a Marketing or Utility Template message first to reopen the window.

**Q3: How many buttons can I add in a Quick Reply message?**

You can add up to 3 reply buttons. Each must have unique text (20-character limit).

**Q: Can I use both headers and footers in a Quick Reply Message?**

Yes. Headers support Text, Image, Video, or Document. Footers support short text only (max 60 characters).

**Q: What happens if I enter the wrong coordinates for a Location Message?**

The location card may drop the pin in the wrong place. Always verify latitude and longitude before saving.

**Q: Can I send multiple contacts in a single Contact Message?**

No. Each Contact Message supports one contact card. To send multiple, create separate actions.

**Q: How many sections and rows can I add in a List Message?**

You can configure multiple sections, each with one or more rows. Each row requires a title (mandatory) and can include an optional description. Timeout must be set between 5 minutes and 2 days.

**Q: Can I personalize URLs in Interactive Call-to-Action (Visit Website) Button Messages?**

Yes. You can use CRM variables, including contact fields and custom values, inside URLs. Example:

```
https://www.google.com/?name={{contact.name}}&calendar={{custom_values.agent_calendar}}
```

This allows you to create personalized booking links, payment pages, or campaign landing pages.

**Q: What happens if the customer taps a Visit Website button?**

The link opens in their default browser. In workflows, you can branch based on outcomes:

- Link Opened

- Not Delivered

- Timeout


**Q: What are the timeout rules for Interactive Messages?**

Timeouts define how long an interactive message (buttons, lists, or visit website buttons) stays active.

- Minimum: 5 minutes

- Maximum: 2 days


After timeout, the interactive element becomes inactive, and you can use the Timeout branch in workflows for follow-ups.

**Q: Can I send multiple interactive types in one message (e.g., a List and a Visit Website Button)?**

No. WhatsApp only allows one interactive message type per message. You can, however, send multiple actions sequentially in workflows.
