# **What is Go Live in Communities?**

Go Live is HighLevel’s built-in live session experience for Communities. It lets admins host interactive meetings or broadcast a professional stream directly into any group or channel. Members can join instantly, chat in real time, react with emojis, and—if enabled—watch replays later. Because it’s native, you keep attention inside your community and simplify setup for hosts and attendees.

Go Live offers two modes:

- **Meeting Room Mode:** An interactive, many-to-many live room with host controls, chat, reactions, hand raise, screen share, and dynamic layouts (Grid/Speaker).

- **Stream Software Mode:** A broadcast experience that connects to external tools like OBS, Zoom, or StreamYard via Stream Key & URL while viewers watch and chat inside your community.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Go Live in Communities**

These benefits focus on outcomes—stronger participation, simpler workflows, and content you can reuse. Use the bullets below to decide when and how to use Go Live for your programs.

- **Native experience:** Members join on web or mobile without chasing links or installing extra tools.

- **Two flexible modes:** Choose interactive meetings or high-quality broadcasts based on your format.

- **Built-in engagement:** Real-time chat, emoji reactions, and hand raise keep sessions lively.

- **Host control:** Mute/unmute, grant/revoke mic/video/screen share, remove attendees, and switch layouts.

- **Recording & replay:** Optionally capture the session and share a replay for those who missed it.

- **Device flexibility:** Preview your camera/mic, choose input devices, and switch as needed.

- **Keeps attention in-platform:** Centralizes discovery, attendance, and follow-up inside your community.

* * *

## **Meeting Room Mode**

Use Meeting Room Mode when you want face-to-face collaboration—coaching calls, cohort workshops, or office hours. Everyone is present in the same space, with the host managing who can speak, present, or share screens.

Highlights

- Preview camera and microphone before joining.

- Distinct Host and Attendee roles with granular permissions.

- Live text chat alongside video.

- Screen share (window or full desktop).

- Emoji reactions and Raise hand to request the mic.

- Dynamic layouts: Grid for collaboration, Speaker for presentations.

- Multi-participant support for panels and roundtables.

- Optional recording so you can post a replay after the session.

* * *

## **Stream Software Mode**

Choose this when you already produce video through external software (OBS, Zoom, StreamYard). You’ll connect your encoder using the provided Stream Key & URL, and your community will watch and interact via chat and reactions.

- Auto-generated Stream Key and Stream URL to connect your encoder.

-  Low-latency playback powered by Media-Core.

- Viewer chat and emoji reactions for real-time feedback.

- Use your existing cameras, scenes, and overlays.
