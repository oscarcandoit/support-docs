# **What is Bulk Editing of Products?**

Bulk Editing of Products enables users to update multiple products at once using a spreadsheet-style editor. Instead of editing each product individually, merchants can make changes across multiple fields in a single view.

This functionality is especially useful for stores with large catalogs, as it reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and provides an intuitive interface for product management.

* * *

## Key Benefits of Bulk Editing of Products in Spreadsheet View

Bulk editing brings efficiency and accuracy to product catalog management. Here are the main benefits:

- **Efficiency:** Edit multiple product attributes simultaneously, reducing time spent on manual updates.

- **Comprehensive Control:** Update details like titles, descriptions, media, tax codes, collections, inventory, shipping, and SEO in one place.

- **Familiar Workflow:** Edit directly in a spreadsheet-like grid, making the process easy and intuitive.

- **Error Prevention:** Built-in validation highlights mistakes and prevents saving invalid data.

## **How To Setup Bulk Editing of Products in Spreadsheet View**

Proper setup ensures smooth usage of the Bulk Editing feature. Follow these steps to begin editing your products:

### **Open Payments**

Navigate to the **Payments** section from the left sidebar to begin product management. This is the entry point for accessing all product-related actions.

```
Tip: Ensure you have the correct user permissions; otherwise, editing may not be available.
```

Validation: Invalid entries are highlighted in red and must be corrected before saving.

Plan Note: Fields that are not available for your plan display as (—).

Some fields may show as non-editable (—) depending on your plan (Agency vs. SaaS).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:****I selected many products and some rows show dashes (—) for certain fields. Can I still save changes for the editable fields, and what happens to the non-editable ones?**

Yes. You can edit any cells that are editable in the spreadsheet grid; cells that show (—) are not editable for your plan or product type and will remain unchanged. Saving applies only to your valid edits. If any **required** field (e.g., Title or Price/Amount) is invalid or blank in any editable row, saving is blocked until those errors are resolved. For **Agency Plan Products**, all fields are non-editable.

**Q:****If just one product has an invalid value (red cell) or a missing required field, does it block saving for the entire bulk edit?**

Yes. The spreadsheet view validates the entire grid. A single invalid cell or a blank required field blocks the **Save** action. The invalid cell is highlighted **red**, and you’ll continue to see **Unsaved Changes** until all validation issues are fixed. Correct the highlighted cells or re-expose the needed column via **Manage Fields** to complete the save.

**Q:****I hid some columns using Manage Fields. Can I still save if a required field is hidden—and what if that hidden field is blank in some rows?**

Hiding a column doesn’t bypass validation. Required fields must still be valid for every edited product. If a hidden required field is blank or invalid in any row, saving is blocked. Reopen **Manage Fields**, re-select the required columns (e.g., **Title**, **Amount**, **Product Type**), fix the values, and then save.
