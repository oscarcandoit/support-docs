# **What is Workflow Email Action AI?**

Workflow Email Action AI is an integrated artificial intelligence tool within HighLevel’s workflow builder that allows users to generate complete, context-aware emails simply by describing their intent. Instead of manually writing email content, you can use the “Write with AI” feature to instantly create emails tailored to your use case, tone, and audience.

This feature is designed to help users automate email creation, ensuring consistency, professionalism, and high engagement rates, all while reducing the time and effort traditionally required for copywriting.
