# What Is Personalized Video?

Personalized video is a native feature inside the HighLevel mobile app that allows you to record and send unique video messages directly to contacts via SMS or email. These one-on-one videos are great for introducing yourself, confirming appointments, or sending follow-ups that feel more human and authentic.

No external apps or integrations are needed—everything is built into the HighLevel mobile experience.

## Key Benefits of Personalized Videos

Sending a quick video message helps you stand out and create real human connections. Here’s how personalized video boosts your outreach results.

- Increases open and reply rates for emails and texts

- Adds a personal touch that builds instant trust

- Helps reduce no-shows with friendly appointment confirmations

- Re-engages cold leads more effectively than plain text

- Makes onboarding feel more welcoming and personalized

- Sets your agency or business apart with professional communication


## How to Send Personalized Videos in the HighLevel Mobile App

You can send a personalized video in just a few taps using the HighLevel mobile app. Here’s how to record and share your message instantly.

1. With the HighLevel Mobile App, recording and sending a video message is as simple as:

2. Open a conversation with a contact (via SMS, Instagram, or Facebook DMs).

3. Tap the plus (+) icon.

4. Select “Video” to launch your camera and record your message.

5. Hit “Use Video” and send it instantly.

6. The app generates a unique, branded link for each video, allowing recipients to watch your message directly on their phones—no downloads needed!


✅ Note: The video is delivered as a clickable link with a preview image. Contacts do not need to download anything to view it.

## Tips for Effective Video Messages

Want your video messages to really land? These quick tips can help you deliver better results.

- Keep your videos between 30–60 seconds

- Use the contact’s name and reference something specific

- Smile and maintain eye contact with the camera

- Be casual, clear, and concise

- End with a simple CTA like “Reply if that sounds good!” or “Let me know what works for you.”

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I send personalized videos from my desktop?

No, the personalized video feature is currently only available in the HighLevel mobile app.

Q: Can I track whether a contact watched my video?

Not at this time. Videos are sent as links, and while click tracking may be available via SMS/email, video watch analytics are not yet built into this feature.

Q: Is there a limit to how many videos I can send?

There is no known limit, but long videos may take longer to upload. For best performance, keep videos under 2 minutes.

Q: Will my video be embedded or linked?

Videos are sent as a link preview with a thumbnail. The contact taps the link to view the video in their browser.

Q: Can I add a call-to-action or link with my video?

You can include a short message along with the video link, but full landing pages or CTAs are not available within the native feature.

### Next Steps

- Open the HighLevel mobile app and try sending a test video to yourself or a team member

- Encourage your sales team to incorporate video for lead outreach
