### **Why This Playbook Matters?**

You fix leaks, replace water heaters, and handle emergencies—but what are you doing to keep your pipeline of customers flowing?

Most plumbers rely on word-of-mouth or one-time calls, but in today’s digital world…

### Industry Metrics:

- ✅ 76% of customers research plumbing services on social media before calling.

- ✅ 47% of homeowners book the first plumber they find online with recent content or reviews.

- ✅ Businesses that post 3+ times per week generate **2.5X more leads**.


Yet most plumbing businesses:

- Don’t post consistently.

- Don’t respond fast enough.

- Don’t know what content actually drives bookings.


> **Social media = trust, visibility, and more jobs**—when done right.

### **What You’ll Learn?**

✅ How to turn Facebook & Instagram into booking engines

✅ The best content to post for plumbing leads (and what not to post)

✅ How to target homeowners, property managers & commercial clients

✅ How to automate content, replies, and lead follow-ups

✅ How to run low-cost ads that drive high-ticket plumbing jobs

* * *

### **Step 1: Build a Strong Social Presence**

#### **Why It Matters?**

If customers can't find you—or trust you—online, they’ll hire someone else.

#### **1.1 Choose the Right Platforms for Plumbing**

| Platform | What It’s Best For |
| --- | --- |
| **Facebook** | Local trust, neighborhood groups, homeowner outreach |
| **Instagram** | Visual before/after jobs, water damage photos, Reels |
| **LinkedIn** | Facility managers, B2B plumbing contracts |
| **YouTube** | Plumbing tips, product installs, “how to avoid clogs” |
| **GBP** | Reviews, contact, and local SEO ranking |

**Use Case:**

A Texas-based plumber started posting short videos on Instagram showing "How we unclogged this drain in under 10 mins" and got **21 new jobs in 2 weeks**.

### **Step 2: Create Engaging Plumbing Content**

#### **Why It Matters?**

No one wants to see pipes all day. But smart content can educate, build trust, and trigger a booking.

#### **2.1 Content That Gets Results**

| Content Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Before/After Fixes** | “We replaced this 15-year-old rusted pipe—here’s how.” |
| **Customer Reviews** | “John’s water heater blew up. We had him up and running in 4 hours!” |
| **Quick Tips** | “Why you should drain your water heater annually” |
| **Emergency Explainers** | “What to do if your toilet overflows” |
| **Service Promos** | “$75 off drain cleaning this week only!” |
| **Behind-the-Scenes** | “On-site at a commercial boiler replacement!” |

**Content Rule:**

80% helpful / engaging

20% direct promotions

#### **[How to Create Ad Campaign using existing Templates](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003502-ad-manager-create-ad-campaigns-using-templates)**

#### **2.2 Use the Right Hashtags & Tags**

- **Instagram/Facebook:**`#EmergencyPlumber`, `#DrainCleaning`, `#WaterHeaterRepair`

- **LinkedIn:**`#CommercialPlumbing`, `#FacilityMaintenance`, `#PlumbingPros`

- **Google Posts:** Use local keywords: `Plumber in Chicago`, `Water Line Replacement Dallas`

### **Step 3: Run Low-Cost Ads That Convert**

#### **Why It Matters?**

Only 5-10% of your followers see your posts organically. Ads fill your calendar fast.

#### **3.1 Smart Plumbing Ad Strategies**

- **Facebook Lead Ads**: “$99 Drain Clean Special – Book Online Now”

- **Retargeting Ads**: Show ads to people who visited your site but didn’t book

- **YouTube Ads**: "How to spot a leak" → Promote your service at the end

- **Google LSAs**: Appear at the top for “Emergency Plumber Near Me”


#### [How to Run Facebook Ads for Cleaning Businesses](https://www.gohighlevelinfo.com/post/gohighlevel-facebook-ads-integration)

#### **3.2 Target the Right Audience**

- ZIP code + radius targeting (10-20 miles)

- Age: 30–65+ homeowners

- Interests: Home repair, property ownership, facilities management


#### **3.3 Suggested Plumbing Ad Budgets**

| Business Size | Recommended Ad Spend |
| --- | --- |
| Solo Plumber | $10/day ($300/month) for Facebook & Instagram Lead Ads |
| Small Team | $25/day ($750/month) for a **multi-platform strategy** |
| Franchise | $50/day+ ($1,500+/mo) for **brand awareness + lead generation** |
