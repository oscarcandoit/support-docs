# **How to Create a Product**

First things first, let's get your amazing product listed. Think of this like setting up your store shelves—you want everything clear, attractive, and inviting!

1. Navigate to **Payments > Products**

2. Click **+** **Create Product**



![](https://jumpshare.com/share/fBDdqVJwwG1TsWREBhwj+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-19+at+9.14.04+PM.png)

3. Fill in **Product** **Information:** The **Product Information** section is where you define the foundational details for your product.




   - First, the **“Include in Online Store”** toggle allows you to determine whether this product should be visible and available for purchase through your online storefront. If you want your product to be publicly available, this toggle must remain enabled.

   - Next, the **Title** field is a required input where you name your product—this will be shown across your checkout, internal views, and potentially public listings. Below that, the **Description** field allows you to provide a detailed overview of the product, using rich text formatting options such as bold, italics, links, bullet points, and font customization to enhance readability and appeal.

   - The **Media** section lets you upload an image or video file to visually represent your product. This helps users quickly recognize what they’re buying. It’s recommended to upload files with a resolution of 1024×1024 and a size not exceeding 10MB for optimal display and performance.



     ![](https://jumpshare.com/share/jx4JqBbfNNzmej1hs8no+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-19+at+9.20.36+PM.png)

   - There is also an **Enable Product Label** checkbox. If enabled, you can assign a custom label (e.g., “New,” “Top Pick,” etc.) to the product which may be used for visual badges or internal organization.

   - Lastly, the **Product Collection** dropdown lets you assign this product to an existing collection. Collections help group similar products together for better organization and presentation, especially when managing a larger catalog.



     ![](https://jumpshare.com/share/ErP4vB8hGj3zhm1wvsAy+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-19+at+9.17.15+PM.png)
4. **Configure Tax Options:** The **Product Information** section includes several key fields to define how the product is presented and taxed.




   - One of the first elements here is the **Product Tax Code**, which allows you to select a specific tax category for your product. This is important for enabling automatic tax calculations during checkout. If left blank, the system will apply your default global tax settings.

   - Next, the **Include tax in prices** option gives you control over whether your product pricing should be shown as tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive. You can either follow the global setting or manually choose “Yes” to include tax in the displayed price or “No” to show it as a separate charge.

   - Additionally, there’s an option to **Attach Tax Rates**, which is useful if you’re handling taxes manually or have buyers outside the U.S.

   - Finally, the **Statement Descriptor** that opens on clicking **Additional Settings**field allows you to override the default account name that appears on a customer’s bank statement. This ensures clarity for the buyer and can help reduce payment disputes or confusion.




     ![](https://jumpshare.com/share/c37zj0BYH7sUt1WTu9kk+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-19+at+9.19.11+PM.png)
5. **Set Pricing:** In the **Pricing** section of the product setup, users can define how their product will be offered to customers by configuring a range of pricing-related fields.




   - Start by entering a **Pricing Name**, which serves as an internal label to help distinguish between different pricing options if you’re offering multiple tiers or plans.

   - Next, select the **Type** of pricing from the dropdown—either **Onetime**, which charges the customer a single fee, or **Recurring**, which adds options for billing cycles, trial periods, and setup fees.

   - In the **Amount** field, input the exact price you want to charge for the product. You can optionally enter a **Compare-at Price**, which is useful for showing discounted pricing by displaying the original price next to the actual price being charged.

   - Below this, use the **Currency** selector to define which currency the payment will be made in, such as USD.

   - If inventory tracking is relevant, check the **Track Inventory** box to manage stock levels and input available quantities.

   - Clicking on **Additional Options** reveals more advanced pricing settings like purchase limits or metadata fields.

   - Use the **Price Description**field to add a brief note or context for this pricing entry (visible internally).




     ![](https://jumpshare.com/share/8HG7RSyvVbHIU1zFiSLr+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-19+at+9.23.10+PM.png)
6. **Add Product Variants:** The “Variants” section lets you create different versions of a product, such as multiple pricing tiers, content levels, or access durations.




   - To set this up, you first add an **Option name** like “Course Level” or “Access Plan.”

   - Then, under **Option values**, you input the specific variants (e.g., “Basic,” “Premium,” “Pro”) and click **Done**.

   - Each variant can have its own **price**, **compare-at price**, and **available quantity**, making it easy to manage inventory and pricing for each option.

   - You can also enable **Track Inventory** if you want to limit how many of each variant can be sold. This is especially useful when offering bundles or time-limited enrollment.



     ![](https://jumpshare.com/share/fPt8mwC0LVZaqwHBiN5K+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-19+at+9.24.39+PM.png)
7. **Optimize Search Engine Settings:** The **Search Engine Listing** section helps optimize your product for search engines and improves its discoverability online.




   - In the **SEO Title** field, you can enter a concise and relevant title that clearly identifies the product and includes keywords users might search for.

   - The **SEO Description** allows you to provide a brief summary of the product that also incorporates relevant keywords, enhancing visibility in search results.

   - Lastly, the **Handle**defines the product’s unique URL slug (e.g., /product/my-course-name), which can be customized to make the link more readable and SEO-friendly. This section is optional but highly recommended for improving online reach.

8. Click **Save.**
