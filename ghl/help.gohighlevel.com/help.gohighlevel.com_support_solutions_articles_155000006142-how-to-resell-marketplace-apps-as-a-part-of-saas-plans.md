# **What is Reselling Marketplace Apps in SaaS Plans?**

Reselling Marketplace apps in SaaS plans lets agencies include eligible third-party apps as part of a subscription. When a new sub-account is created on a plan containing bundled apps, those apps can be installed automatically, reducing manual work, standardizing toolsets, and improving time-to-value for clients.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Reselling Marketplace Apps in SaaS Plans**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide which apps to bundle and how to price them across tiers.

- **Automatic installation**: New sub-accounts receive bundled apps with selected tiers—no manual steps needed.

- **Flexible billing**: Absorb app costs or price them into your SaaS plan with a markup.

- **Standardized onboarding**: Deliver a consistent, pre-configured app stack for every new client.

- **Centralized control**: Manage app tiers and removals from the SaaS Configurator.

- **Scalable packaging**: Bundle multiple apps (up to current limit) into a single plan.

- **Improved visibility**: Display bundled apps alongside other features/add-ons in the SaaS Configurator.

- **Developer alignment**: Drive installs for participating developers while maintaining pricing control.


* * *

## **How To Resell Marketplace Apps as Part of SaaS Plans**

Following the exact sequence below ensures apps are eligible, bundled correctly, billed as intended, and installed automatically for new sub-accounts.

### **Step 1:** Access Marketplace Apps in SaaS Configurator

1. Click on **SaaS** **Configurator** from your Agencyaccount **.**

2. Either **create a new SaaS plan** or **edit an existing one**.

3. Select the **Marketplace** **Apps** tab.

4. You’ll see apps already installed at your agency that are eligible for packaging.

```
Note: If you don’t see any apps listed, click Explore Marketplace to browse and install new apps at the agency level first.
```

### **Step 2:** Add Apps to Your SaaS Plan

```
Note: By default, app subscription charges bill to your agency card; to pass costs to clients, add the app price plus markup to your SaaS plan price.
```

1. Click on the **+** icon under **Actions** tab to include the app in the bundle.

2. Select which **plan tier** of the app you’d like to bundle with your SaaS plan **if its a paid app**.

3. Repeat for each app you want to include ( **up to 10 per plan**).

4. Click **Save Changes** to confirm.

### **Step 3:** Update or Remove Apps

1. You can **change the pricing plan** of any bundled app from the SaaS Configurator.

2. To remove an app:




   - Click the **Remove** (Bin Button) option next to the app.

   - **Confirm** the warning.

   - Click on the **Save Changes** button.

```
Note: Either of the above will not impact existing sub-accounts that already have the app installed. They’ll continue to use it until you/they uninstall manually.
```

## **Pre-requisites, Considerations & Limits**

Platform limits and behaviors influence packaging strategy and client communication.

- Only apps with the **Agency & Sub-Account only** distribution type are eligible for bundling.

- You can bundle **up to 10 apps per plan** (current MVP limit).

- Agency Owner/Admin permissions recommended for SaaS Configurator access.

- Ensure your billing is active and your **agency card** is valid.

- Install eligible apps at the **agency** level first if they’re not already present.

- Auto-install triggers only on **new** sub-account creation under the plan.

- Changes to app tiers or plan pricing may affect margins; review before saving.


* * *

## **App Cost Handling**

Choosing how costs flow is fundamental to profitability. You can absorb app charges or include them in your plan price.

- By default, app subscription charges are billed to your **agency card**.

- To pass costs on, **raise the SaaS plan price** to include app price + your markup.

- Review pricing tier alignment across all bundled apps to prevent under-recovery.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Who can bundle Marketplace apps into SaaS plans?**

Agency Owners/Admins with access to the SaaS Configurator.

**Q: Do existing sub-accounts get apps automatically if I add them to a plan later?**

No. Auto-install applies to new sub-accounts created after saving your changes. Existing sub-accounts can add the apps manually.

**Q: How many apps can I include in a single plan?**

**Up to 10** apps per plan (current limit).

**Q: How do I pass app costs to clients?**

Increase the SaaS plan price to include the app price plus your markup. App charges bill to your agency card by default.

**Q: What happens if I change the tier of a bundled app?**

New sub-accounts get the updated tier going forward. Existing sub-accounts retain their current install until you/they change or uninstall it.

**Q: If I remove a bundled app from a plan, does it uninstall from current clients?**

No. Removal stops future installs only. Existing sub-accounts keep the app until it’s manually uninstalled.

**Q: I don’t see any apps in the Marketplace Apps tab. What should I do?**

Click **Explore Marketplace** to install eligible apps at the agency level, then return to the Configurator.

**Q: Can I keep automatic future installation enabled at the agency level and also bundle the app in a plan?**

No. When an app is added to a plan, its agency-level automatic future installation is disabled to prevent conflicts.
