# **What are Notes in HighLevel?**

Notes in HighLevel are an internal tool for documenting and tracking important information related to contacts, opportunities, and companies. They provide a centralized place for team members to log updates, reminders, or context that may be useful for future reference. Notes are strictly for **internal use**—clients cannot view them in their portal or through external communication.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Notes**

Using Notes effectively helps businesses maintain context and improve collaboration. Here are the main benefits:

- **Centralized Recordkeeping**: Keep important details in one place for easy reference.

- **Internal Collaboration**: Share context among team members without exposing it to clients.

- **Improved Tracking**: Document key updates like calls, payments, or follow-ups.

- **Flexible Organization**: Add, search, filter, and view notes across contacts, opportunities, and companies.

* * *

## **Notes in Contacts Module**

Each contact in HighLevel has its own Notes section where internal users can document updates specific to that contact.

- Notes are tied directly to the selected contact.
- You can add, search, and filter notes within the contact’s profile.
- Useful for logging call summaries, payment confirmations, or client preferences.

### **Access the Notes Section from Contacts**

From within the **Contacts module**, click the **Notes icon** (pen and paper symbol) at the top of the contact’s record. This opens the **Notes panel**, where you can create, view, and manage notes related to that specific contact.

## **Notes in Opportunities Module**

Opportunities provide a consolidated view of notes connected to the primary contact and related contacts.

- By default, you will see notes associated with the **primary contact** of the opportunity.
- Filters allow you to include additional contacts’ notes linked to the same opportunity.
- Useful for sales teams who need visibility into all interactions tied to a deal.

* * *

## **Notes in Companies Module**

The Companies module aggregates notes across all contacts associated with a company.

- The Notes section shows discussions and updates across multiple linked contacts.
- This provides a company-wide perspective rather than being tied to one individual.
- Ideal for account managers handling multiple stakeholders within one business.

## **How to Use Notes**

Notes can be added, searched, filtered, and reviewed in a few simple steps.

### **Adding a Note**

- Navigate to the **Notes tab** within a contact, opportunity, or company.
- Click **\+ Add Note** to create a new note.
- Enter your description and click **Save**.

### **Searching for Notes**

Use the **Search bar** in the Notes section to find entries by keywords.

### **Filter Notes**

Click the **Filter icon** in the Notes section to narrow down which notes you want to see. Filters help you quickly locate specific information without scrolling through all notes.

**Available filter types:**

- **Contacts:** Show only notes linked to a specific contact. Useful when reviewing updates or history tied to one person.

- **Opportunities:** Display notes related to a sales opportunity. This helps sales teams track deal-specific interactions or updates.

- **Created By:** Filter notes based on the team member who created them. Helpful for collaboration when multiple users manage the same contact.

### **Sort Notes by Date Created**

Click the **Sort icon** in the Notes section to arrange notes based on when they were created. You can choose:

- **Ascending (Oldest First):** Displays notes starting from the earliest created, useful for reviewing the full history in sequence.

- **Descending (Newest First):** Displays the most recent notes at the top, making it easier to see the latest updates quickly.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can contacts see the notes added to their record?**

No. Notes are for internal use only. Clients cannot view notes in their portal, emails, or any external communications.

**Q: Who on my team can view notes?**

Any team member with access to the record (contact, opportunity, or company) can view notes. Visibility may depend on user roles and permissions.

**Q: Can I export or download notes for reporting?**

Notes cannot be directly exported as a standalone report. However, they can be included when exporting records (such as contacts) via the Smart Lists feature.

**Q: Are notes included in automations or workflows?**

Notes themselves cannot trigger automations. However, actions related to the contact or opportunity (such as status updates) can be used in workflows alongside manually created notes for context.
