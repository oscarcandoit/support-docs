Modified on: Thu, 6 Nov, 2025 at 12:35 PM

Whether you export code from a static-site generator, an AI page builder, or hand-write HTML, the Custom HTML Pages feature keeps all of your hosting under one roof for faster performance and simpler workflows.

# **What are Custom HTML Pages?**

Custom HTML Pages let you upload a single .html file to your HighLevel-hosted WordPress site and publish it as a live page on your mapped domain. Instead of relying on a drag-and-drop editor, you can upload prebuilt code from any tool—giving developers and agencies full control while maintaining the convenience and security of HighLevel hosting.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Custom HTML Pages**

Using Custom HTML Pages empowers you to expand your website-building workflow without giving up the reliability and performance of HighLevel’s hosting infrastructure.

- **All-in-one hosting:** Manage builder-based and code-based pages within the same WordPress site.

- **Performance optimized:** Static HTML files load instantly for faster site speeds.

- **Flexible integration:** Works seamlessly with AI tools, SSGs, and manual HTML code.

- **Simplified SSL & domain setup:** Uses your existing HighLevel SSL certificates and domain connections.

- **Future-ready design:** Perfect for microsites, custom landing pages, or one-off campaign pages.


* * *

## **File Requirements & Limitations**

Understanding file requirements ensures your upload process is smooth and prevents publishing errors.

- Only a single .html file can be uploaded at a time.

- **Maximum file size:** 5 MB.

- Images, CSS, and JavaScript files must be referenced via **absolute URLs** (e.g., from a CDN or media library).

- Relative paths and multi-folder uploads are **not yet supported**.

- Each upload represents **one unique page**. (Multiple pages require separate uploads.)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I upload multiple pages at once?**

No. Each upload supports one .html file. Multi-page ZIP uploads are planned for a future release.

**Q: How do I add CSS, images, or scripts?**

Host assets externally (like a CDN or your WordPress media library) and reference them with absolute URLs. Client-side scripts such as analytics or tracking pixels are supported.

**Q: Can I edit an uploaded page?**

You can’t edit HTML directly in HighLevel. To make changes, update your HTML file locally and upload a new version to replace the existing one.

**Q: How do I replace a page I’ve already uploaded?**

Open the **Pages** tab in your WordPress site, click the **Action Menu (⋮)** beside the page name, and select **Upload New Version**.This replaces the old file while keeping your original URL and settings intact.

**Q: Does this feature require extra hosting fees?**

No. It’s included with your existing HighLevel WordPress hosting plan.
