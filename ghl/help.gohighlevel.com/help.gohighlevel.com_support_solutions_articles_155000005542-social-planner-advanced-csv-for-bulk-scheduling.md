# **What is Advanced CSV for Bulk Scheduling in Social Planner?**

Advanced CSV for Bulk Scheduling is a robust enhancement to HighLevel’s Social Planner, enabling users to upload and schedule content in bulk using a feature-rich CSV or XLSX template. This tool supports advanced platform-specific settings, media optimization, watermarks, tags, categories, and more, making it the most comprehensive CSV importer available for social media management.

By leveraging the Advanced CSV, users can efficiently plan, organize, and automate posts across platforms like Facebook, Instagram (including Stories, Reels), YouTube Shorts, Google Business Profile, TikTok, Pinterest, and others, all from a single workflow.
