## **Why This Playbook Matters?**

Winning a **new plumbing customer is 5X more expensive** than retaining an existing one. Yet, many plumbing businesses **chase new leads** while neglecting the **goldmine of repeat customers & referrals.**

### **The Reality?**

✅ **76% of homeowners call the same plumber again—if they follow up.**

✅ **Referral customers convert 5X faster & spend 16% more** than cold leads.

✅ **Plumbers who send review requests after service see a 35% increase in repeat bookings.**

This playbook will **show you how to turn every job into more business**—on autopilot.

✅ How to **get more 5-star reviews to boost trust & bookings.**

✅ How to **create a referral program that turns happy clients into sales reps.**

✅ How to **offer maintenance plans for steady revenue.**

✅ How to **use AI & Smart Lists to prevent customer churn.**

* * *

### **Step 1: Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking**

#### **Why It Matters?**

Most plumbing businesses **lose thousands** because they **don’t follow up** with past customers.

**Fact:** **65% of customers forget their plumber’s name** after just 6 months.

#### **1.1 Post-Service Follow-Up Messages**

✔ **Send an automated thank-you SMS or email** after every plumbing job.

✔ **Ask if everything is running smoothly** & remind them about future service.

✔ **Offer a discount for their next service** to boost retention.

**Example Message:**

_"Hey Mike, thanks for trusting \[Your Business Name\] for your plumbing needs! Everything running smoothly? Schedule a pipe checkup in 6 months & get $50 off!"_

#### [How to Automate Customer Follow-Ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001165881-how-to-build-automated-appointment-follow-up-surveys-in-workflow-builder)

### **1.2 Automated Check-In Reminders**

✔ **Set up maintenance reminders for key services** (e.g., drain cleaning, water heater inspections).

✔ **Offer a quick way to book their next appointment online.**

**Example Message:**

_"Mike, it’s been 6 months since your last water heater check. Need us to stop by? Reply YES, and we’ll take care of it!"_

#### [How to Set Up Maintenance Reminders](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001167806-how-to-send-users-appointment-reminders)

* * *

## **Step 2: Get More 5-Star Reviews Automatically**

### **Why It Matters?**

⭐ **85% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.**

⭐ **Plumbing businesses with 50+ Google reviews rank 2X higher** than those with fewer.

### **2.1 Automate Review Requests**

✔ **Trigger SMS & email review requests right after job completion.**

✔ **Personalize the request with the customer’s name & job details.**

✔ **Direct them to Google, Facebook, and Yelp for maximum exposure.**

**Example Message:**

_"Hey Mike, thanks for choosing us! If we did a great job, could you leave us a quick review? It helps us a ton! Click here: \[Google Review Link\]"_

#### [How to Automate Review Requests](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004791-leak-proof-growth-mastering-retention-referrals-for-explosive-plumbing-business-success\#)

### **2.2 Handle Negative Reviews Proactively**

✔ **AI flags negative reviews before they go public.**

✔ **Customers with complaints get a follow-up call first.**

✔ **Turn unhappy customers into loyal clients by resolving issues quickly.**

**Example:**

_A customer had a complaint about a late service. Instead of leaving a bad review, they receive a follow-up message:_

_"Hey Mike, we noticed you weren’t fully satisfied. We’d love to make things right! Let’s schedule a free touch-up. Reply YES to book."_

* * *

## **Step 3: Create a Referral Machine**

### **Why It Matters?**

**Referral customers convert 5X faster and spend 16% more** than leads from ads.

**Fact:** **Plumbing businesses with referral programs grow 30% faster** than those relying only on ads.

### **3.1 Set Up a Referral Program**

✔ **Reward customers who refer friends & family with discounts or service credits.**

✔ **Offer an incentive to both the referrer & the new customer (e.g., $50 off their next service).**

**Example Message:**

_"Love our plumbing service? Refer a friend & you BOTH get $50 off your next job! Just send them this link: \[Referral Link\]"_

#### [How to Set Up an Automated Referral Program](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001213448-affiliate-refferal-page-leads-customers-cancelled-statuses)

### **3.2 Automate Referral Follow-Ups**

✔ **Send referral reminders after service.**

✔ **Track referrals & apply rewards automatically with HighLevel.**

**Example Message:**

_"Know someone who needs a plumber? Refer them now & get $50 off your next repair!"_

* * *

## **Step 4: Lock in Recurring Revenue with Plumbing Maintenance Plans**

## **Why It Matters?**

Plumbers who offer maintenance plans **generate 30% more repeat business** and **higher customer retention rates.**

### **4.1 Offer Service Plans for Recurring Work**

✔ **Create annual or semi-annual plumbing maintenance plans.**

✔ **Automate invoicing & renewal reminders so customers never miss a service.**

**Example Message:**

_"Join our VIP Plumbing Plan: Annual home plumbing check + priority service for $199/year. Save $$ & avoid costly emergencies!"_

#### [How to Set Up Subscription-Based Services](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004138-pause-and-resume-subscriptions)

### **4.2 Upsell Preventative Maintenance During Jobs**

✔ **Train your team to suggest maintenance plans after major repairs.**

✔ **Offer a discount for signing up on the spot.**

**Example Message:**

_"Mike, we just fixed your water heater. Want to lock in annual maintenance? Sign up today & get $25 off!"_

* * *

### **Step 5: Use AI & Smart Lists to Boost Customer Engagement**

### **Why It Matters?**

Your past customers are **10X more likely** to book again than a cold lead. **HighLevel automates personalized outreach based on customer history.**

### **5.1 Smart Lists for Re-Engagement**

✔ **Create lists of past customers by service type, location, or last booking date.**

✔ **Send seasonal promotions, upgrade offers, and rebooking reminders.**

### **5.2 AI-Powered Follow-Ups & Surveys**

✔ **Use AI to check in with past customers via SMS.**

✔ **Send satisfaction surveys to prevent churn and improve service.**

**Example Message:**

_"Hey \[First Name\], it’s been 6 months since your last plumbing check. Need an inspection? Reply YES to book!"_
