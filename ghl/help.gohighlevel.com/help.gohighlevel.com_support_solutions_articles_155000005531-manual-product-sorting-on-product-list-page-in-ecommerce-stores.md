# **What is Manual Product Sorting?**

Manual Product Sorting is a HighLevel Ecommerce Store feature that allows store owners to set a custom display order for products on the Product List Page. By assigning a display priority to each product, you can highlight bestsellers, new arrivals, or promotional items, ensuring they are seen first by your customers. This hands-on approach to product arrangement enhances your store’s visual appeal and sales strategy.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Manual Product Sorting**

Manual Product Sorting gives you more control over your store’s presentation and customer experience. Here’s how it helps:

- **Highlight Key Products:** Feature high-priority or seasonal products at the top of your list.

- **Custom Merchandising:** Arrange products to match your marketing campaigns or inventory goals.

- **Flexible Tie-Breaking:** Products with the same priority are automatically sorted alphabetically for consistency.

- **Easy to Adjust:** Quickly update product order with simple number assignments and instant results.

- **Default for New Stores:** The “Featured” sorting option is set as the default for all new stores, streamlining setup.

- **Error Prevention:** Only whole numbers are accepted, reducing mistakes and confusion.

- **Immediate Feedback:** Changes are reflected instantly, so you always know how your product list will appear.

### **Step 3:** Set Display Priorities for Products

1. Locate the **Display Priority** column next to each product.

2. For each product you want to prioritize:




   - Enter a **whole number** (e.g., 1, 2, 3) into the field.

   - **Lower numbers appear higher** on the Product List Page.




     - 1 = Highest priority

     - 2, 3, and so on follow in descending order
3. Click the **Save Changes** button to apply your settings.


```
Note: Only whole numbers are supported. Decimal values (e.g., 0.1, 1.5) or letters (e.g., ABCD) will cause a validation error and won’t be accepted.
```
