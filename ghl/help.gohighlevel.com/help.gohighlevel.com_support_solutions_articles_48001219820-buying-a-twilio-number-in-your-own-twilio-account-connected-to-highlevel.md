To do this:

- Go to **HighLevel Agency View > Settings > Phone Integration > Sub-account Settings**.

- Find and **copy the Account SID** for the specific location.

**Step 2: Locate the Sub-account in Twilio**

**Frequently asked question**

#### **Q1)** **Will the newly purchased Twilio number automatically appear in my HighLevel location?**

**A)** Yes. As long as your Twilio sub-account is properly connected to the correct HighLevel location, the number will sync automatically and appear under **Settings > Phone Numbers** in the location.

**Q2)** **How do I make sure I’m using the correct Twilio sub-account?**

**A)** You can confirm the correct sub-account by:

- Going to your HighLevel **Agency view > Settings > Phone Integration > Sub-account Settings**

- Copying the Account SID linked to the location

- Using that SID to search and switch to the correct sub-account in Twilio


#### **Q)Do I need to configure anything else after buying the number?**

**A)** No additional configuration is required if your Twilio account is correctly integrated with HighLevel. The number should be fully functional for workflows, conversations, and calls.
