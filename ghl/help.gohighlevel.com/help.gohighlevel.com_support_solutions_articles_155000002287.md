# **WhatsApp Business Display Name Guidelines**

1. **Follow WhatsApp’s Policies**

Your display name must comply with WhatsApp’s Commerce and Business policies. It should reflect your business without violating any rules.

**Accepted Example:**

   - Sarah’s Sporting Goods Shop (Clearly represents the business)
2. **Not Accepted Example:**

   - Sarah’s Sporting Goods Shop – Guns Department (Restricted product category)
3. **Your Display Name Should Accurately Represent Your Business**

Your display name must:

   - Clearly state the business name, product, service, or department.
   - Be used for test/demo accounts, as long as they are linked to a business (e.g., Fresh Produce Test).
4. Your display name should not:

   - Be a generic term (e.g., Fashion).
   - Be a geographic location (e.g., New York).
   - Include words like Official or Verified, as they imply WhatsApp verification.
   - Contain Meta product names (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger).

```
Special cases: If your business has a government affiliation, WhatsApp approval is required.By following these guidelines, you ensure your WhatsApp Business display name is compliant, professional, and easily.
```
