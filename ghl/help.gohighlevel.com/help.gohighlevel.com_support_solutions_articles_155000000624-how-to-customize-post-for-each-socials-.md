The "Customize for Each Post" feature is an innovative tool that allows marketers, businesses, and individuals to create and manage tailored content for different social media channels, all within one interface. Here's a thorough understanding of what the feature entails:

**Multi-Platform Compatibility:** This feature enables users to select multiple social media platforms (such as Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) and customize the content according to the specific character limitations and requirements of each platform.

**Content Customization:** Recognizing the disparities in character limits among various social media channels, this feature allows for individualized content crafting. Whether you want a short message for LinkedIn or an extended post for Facebook, you can create both within the same interface.

**Toggle Switch:** A simple toggle switch allows users to switch between customized content for different channels and standardized content that applies across all selected platforms. This ensures flexibility in content creation and delivery.

**AI Integration:** The integration with Content AI means users can leverage artificial intelligence to generate content up to 900 words, adapting it to different content sizes (small, medium, and large) based on the type of social media being used.

**Scheduling Capability:** Not only can you create customized posts, but you can also schedule them for a later time, automating your social media management process.

**Cost-Effective and Time-Efficient:** This feature minimizes the effort needed to create separate posts for different platforms, saving time and resources and ensuring a cohesive yet customized marketing approach.

**Choose to Customize for Each Channel:**

To get the customization option to appear, you need to select multiple social media channels, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, GMB (Google My Business), etc.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155005176611/original/uD1WdXkMBcdAAioCchZ9KI4iXPrdpzvs_g.png?1692035350)

Once you've selected the social media channels you want to post on, you'll see an option to "toggle on" the customization for each channel.

**Craft Your Custom Content:**

Write your content for each channel, making sure to adhere to the specific character limits for each platform (e.g., 5,000 for Facebook, 1,500 for GMB, etc.).

### **Character Limits of Various Social Media Channels**

Here's a table that indicates the character limits for different social media channels, an essential factor in using the "Customize for Each Post" feature:

| Channel | Character limit |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook pages & groups | 5,000 |
| Instagram profiles | 2,200 |
| LinkedIn pages & profiles | 3,000 |
| GMB (Google My Business) | 1,500 |

You can view and edit the content for different channels separately, ensuring that each post aligns with the platform's character limit and audience preferences.

**Add Media (image/video): [Adding reference for file sizes](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001210585-posting-content-image-video-and-text-guidelines)**

You can add images, videos, or other multimedia elements to enhance your post if applicable for each social media.

**Note:**

1. Media will be discarded if you switch social accounts during upload.
2. Switching the “Customize” option while media is uploading will remove the media. Please wait until the upload completes.
3. If a video thumbnail is processing, switching the social account or the “Customize” option will interrupt it. Users will need to manually re-add the thumbnail.


**Leverage Content AI (Optional):**

If you want to utilize AI for content creation, you can do so at this stage to generate new words or adapt the content size based on the type of social media.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155005177049/original/4YnRYABTyjSflTUNTFwCTIhQ7l7fOgp7GA.png?1692035835)

**Schedule or Post Immediately:**

Once you've crafted the content for each channel, you can post it immediately or schedule it later.

Confirm and review all details to ensure accuracy and consistency across platforms.

**Please Note:**

```
If you turn off the customization toggle, the active social content will apply to all the social channels selected, and there will be a warning that customized content will be lost.
```

By following these steps, you can utilize the "Customize for Each Post" feature to create personalized and platform-specific content for different social media channels, maximizing your reach and engagement. It's an efficient way to manage diverse campaigns and tailor messages to resonate with each platform's unique audience.
