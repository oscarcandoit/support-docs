We kindly request a thorough review of our account. If there are any specific actions required on our part to resolve this issue or verify compliance, we are happy to cooperate fully.

Thank you for your time and support. We look forward to resolving this matter quickly.

### **Step 4: Wait for Meta’s Response**

# **FAQ:**

**Q1: Why was my Meta Business Account blocked?**

**A:** Meta may block accounts due to failed business verification, policy violations (e.g., sending spam), suspicious activity, or incomplete documentation. You can view the exact reason in the [Account Quality Center](https://business.facebook.com/accountquality).

* * *

**Q2: How long does Meta take to review my appeal?**

**A:** Meta typically responds within 3–7 business days. Avoid submitting multiple appeals, as it can delay the review process.

* * *

**Q3: Will my WhatsApp templates, number, or account data be lost during a block?**

**A:** No. Blocking affects the business account access but not the data itself. Once reinstated, your WhatsApp setup and templates remain intact.
