# How to Link Your Privacy Policy When Collecting Personal Data

Modified on: Wed, 9 Jul, 2025 at 4:56 PM

A privacy policy explains how your business collects, uses, and protects personal information—like names, phone numbers, or emails. It’s not just good practice—it’s often legally required under laws like GDPR, CCPA, and A2P 10DLC carrier regulations. HighLevel gives you multiple ways to link your privacy policy wherever you're collecting data from users.

## **How to Create a Privacy Policy Page**

Before you can link to your policy, you’ll need a standalone page (either inside HighLevel or externally hosted). Here's how to do it:

1. Go to **Sites > Funnels** or **Websites**

2. Create a new funnel/website or open an existing one

3. Add a new page and title it “Privacy Policy”

4. Paste your full privacy policy content

5. Publish and copy the page URL
