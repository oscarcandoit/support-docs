SaaS mode now allows you to restrict the number of users that can be added to sub-accounts.

```
The limit only applies to the number of sub-account level users that can be added. You can still add as many agency level users to the sub-account as you require.
```

### **Configuring user limits for SaaS plans**

### **Step 1:** Go to the SaaS configurator. Select ‘Edit Details’ for the plan you need to set the user limit for.  ![brwghjbwhjtghbwrtkghwbthgbhrwktgrwthbgrtwg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010478521/original/8K_wxqV7dV_pAb9YlxIgrX_m7gKLSyutJQ.png?1697646190)

### **Step 2:** Go to the ‘Usage Limits’ tab. ‘User limit’ option can be found there.

![brwghjbwhjtghbwrtkghwbthgbhrwktgrwthbgrtwg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010478590/original/XrEPNmvH03naclIKC7uT7lg-9Dhm38YkYw.png?1697646232)

### **Step 3:** By default, unlimited users are allowed. Enable the User Limit toggle and set the desired limit for this plan.

**![brwghjbwhjtghbwrtkghwbthgbhrwktgrwthbgrtwg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010478645/original/7TxP28d_eOeVBsEV0Rcj5bkkebvr7VMkcA.png?1697646277)**

# **Step 4:** Select 'Save'.

```
The user limit is now set for the plan and any new sub-accounts that are created with/upgraded to this plan will have this limit applied to them.
```

### **Updating user limits for specific sub-accounts**

### **Step 1:** Go to the Sub-accounts page at the agency level. Select the sub-account you need to set the user limit for.  ![brwghjbwhjtghbwrtkghwbthgbhrwktgrwthbgrtwg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010479308/original/AGxyN3VXB_zVDl0-fRmLT-O5ViVDWsj_Bg.png?1697646599)

### **Step 2:** Once you are on the ‘Manage Client’ page, navigate to the ‘Usage Limits’ section. User limits can be found there.

![brwghjbwhjtghbwrtkghwbthgbhrwktgrwthbgrtwg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010479367/original/g4LWyrGNHsNgJOILqfNcHCsart6_OQ2lzg.png?1697646648)

### **Step 3:** Set/update the desired limit and select ‘Save’

```
The user limit that is set on the 'Manage Client' page overrides the limit of the subscribed plan for that sub-account. If the sub-account upgrades their plan, then the limit will also be reset according to their new plan.
