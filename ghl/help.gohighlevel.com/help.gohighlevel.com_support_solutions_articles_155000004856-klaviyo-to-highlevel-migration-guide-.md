- **Evaluate Data Volume:** Assess the amount of data (contacts, custom fields, automations) that needs to be migrated.

### **Step 2:** Define Migration Objectives

- **Set Clear Goals:** Identify the key reasons for migrating to HighLevel, such as integrated CRM functionality, enhanced automation, or better pricing.
