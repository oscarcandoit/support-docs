# **What is a Mobile Estimate?**

An estimate is typically when a skilled service technician reviews a job in-person so that they can build a precise list of the things that need to be done, the parts, supplies, personnel, and time required. This is an "estimate" because it is accurate but subject to change as the job progresses. It is extremely efficient to have a mobile system for managing estimates because the whole process can be done with the customer on-site in real time.

* * *

## **Estimate Dashboard**

The dashboard displays the most important information.

1. Sent estimates
2. Accepted estimates
3. Declined estimates
4. Invoiced estimates
5. Filters narrow down your estimate search results with the help of a search bar, estimate status filter, and a date range filter
6. See all of your estimates in every state (draft, due, paid, etc.), irrespective of whether the estimate was created on web or mobile.
7. New Estimate
8. Estimate card interactions:
1. Tap - Primary action for that estimate (E.g. edit estimate for a draft estimate)
2. Long press - All the actions that can be performed for that estimate (E.g. Copy link, Mark as Accepted)
3. Left swipe - Reveal the two most significant actions along with more, an option to view all (E.g. For a sent estimate, you will see options to edit, delete, and more)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can my client accept or reject the estimate from their phone?**

Yes. Clients can view the estimate through the link they receive and click Accept or Reject directly from their mobile device. The status will update automatically in your dashboard.

**Q: Can I edit an estimate after I send it?**

No, once an estimate is sent, it can’t be edited. If you need to make changes, you’ll need to create a new estimate.

**Q: Will I get a notification when a client signs the estimate?**

Yes. You’ll receive a notification in the app as soon as the client signs or rejects the estimate, so you can take the next steps right away.
