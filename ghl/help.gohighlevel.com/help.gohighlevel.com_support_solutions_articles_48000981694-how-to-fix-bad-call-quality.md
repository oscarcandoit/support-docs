Understanding what causes call issues—like choppy audio, one-way audio, or dropped calls—is the first step in resolving them and ensuring reliable VoIP communication. These issues are often caused by internet instability, device interference, or network misconfiguration. Because HighLevel uses internet-based telephony, even minor problems in your local setup can drastically affect call quality.

## **How to Fix Bad Call Quality**

Diagnosing and resolving call quality issues ensures smoother operations and more effective communication. By methodically troubleshooting your environment—devices, network, and software—you can eliminate the most common causes of poor VoIP performance in HighLevel.

- **Use a Wired Internet Connection:** Wi-Fi is more prone to packet loss and instability. Connect your device directly to your modem/router via Ethernet.

- **Close Bandwidth-Heavy Applications:** Streaming services, file downloads, and cloud backups can affect VoIP quality. Pause or close them during calls.

- **Restart Your Router and Modem:** Power cycling can fix minor internet stability issues. to do this, unplug the power cable from your router and modem, wait 30 seconds then plug them back in and wait for full reconnection

- **Update Your Browser or App:** Outdated browsers or HighLevel apps may cause compatibility issues. Ensure Chrome or the desktop app is updated to the latest version.

- **Use the HighLevel Web App in Google Chrome:** Google Chrome provides the most stable VoIP performance with HighLevel. Avoid other browsers or mobile web access for calling.

- **Use Headphones with a Built-In Microphone:** Headsets reduce echo and improve microphone quality. Avoid using laptop speakers/mics for professional calls.

- **Third Party Apps:** Some extensions or software can conflict with audio settings or eat up bandwidth. Disabling them helps identify the root cause of bad call quality.

- **Check Device and Network Compatibility:** Ensure your internet speed and hardware meet VoIP standards. the recommended minimum speed is 5 Mbps upload/download. [Click here to test your connection with SpeedTest](https://www.speedtest.net/)

- **Check for Firewall or Port Blocking:** Some firewalls block SIP traffic. Ask your IT team to ensure UDP Ports 10000–20000 are open

- **Contact HighLevel Support:** Still having issues? Open a support ticket with call logs and setup details. [Click here to submit a support ticket.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/tickets/new)

## **Advanced Troubleshooting: Jitter, Latency & Packet Loss**

Beyond basic internet issues, advanced VoIP problems often stem from network jitter, latency, and packet loss. Understanding these terms helps IT teams and power users identify deeper connectivity issues affecting HighLevel call performance.

- **Jitter:** Irregular delays in packet delivery. Aim for less than 30ms.

- **Latency (RTT):** Delay between when a sound is sent and heard. Target under 150ms.

- **Packet Loss:** Lost voice data during transmission. Should always be 0%.

## **Interpreting Call Quality Error Codes**

HighLevel automatically detects and displays network issues affecting call quality in real time. Understanding these error codes helps you quickly identify the root cause of audio issues—whether you're using the Web App or Mobile App—so you can apply the correct fix faster.

### **Web App Error Codes**

During a live call, you may see a call error indicator at the top of your HighLevel dashboard. Below are the most common error codes and what they mean:

**`**
**`**

- **`high-rtt:`** High _round-trip time_ indicates network latency. Calls may sound delayed or out of sync.

- **`high-jitter:`** Jitter refers to inconsistent packet delivery. This may cause audio crackling or robotic voices.

**`**

### **Mobile App Error Notifications**
