## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will enabling Services disrupt my existing calendars or workflows?**

No. When you enable Services, HighLevel automatically copies your existing service calendars and creates equivalent Services. Your current calendars and any workflows tied to them continue to work exactly as they do today. You can run Meetings (Existing Calendars) and Services side by side or enable only the one that fits best. This ensures that the transition is smooth and without disruptions.

**Q: Do I have to connect payments before enabling Services?**

No, but you must connect a provider before collecting payments on the booking page.

**Q: Can I enable Services for only some sub-accounts?**

Yes. Since the activation of services is done on a per sub-account basis, you can roll it out selectively. Enabling Services in specific sub-accounts will not affect the other (non-selected) sub-accounts.
