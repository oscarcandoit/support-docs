### **Are You Losing Jobs to Competitors?**

You’re an expert at **fixing leaks, unclogging drains, and installing plumbing systems**, but when homeowners and businesses need a plumber, **are they calling you or your competitors?**

Here’s the reality:

✅ **86% of people search for a plumber online before making a call.**

✅ **75% of searchers never scroll past the first page of Google.**

✅ **Plumbers with 50+ Google reviews get 300% more inquiries than those without.**

If your plumbing business **isn’t ranking at the top of Google**, you’re losing jobs—even if you’re the best plumber in town.

### **What If Your Phone Rang Nonstop With New Jobs?**

Imagine a system that **automatically brings in customers**, **books jobs while you’re out working**, and **ranks your business at the top of local search results.**

This playbook will help you:

✅ **Rank higher on Google & generate more plumbing leads.**

✅ **Turn your website into a 24/7 lead-generating machine.**

✅ **Use AI & automation to capture and follow up with leads instantly.**

✅ **Track every call & booking so you know exactly what’s working.**

✅ **Run high-converting ads (once you’ve maximized organic leads!).**
