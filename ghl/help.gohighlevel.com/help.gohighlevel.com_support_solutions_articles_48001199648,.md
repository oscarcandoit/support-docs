# Adding an Additional Domain

Once your site is ready to publish, you can connect your domain to the WordPress site.

Please follow _**[this article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001219237)**_ for instructions on connecting your domain with the WordPress site.

# FAQs

## Q1: I'm unable to add the same domain to my other subaccount/location:

The same domain/subdomain can't be used in 2 locations

## Q2: Why can't I update my primary domain?

The primary domain can be updated if you have [added an additional domain](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001219237).

## Q3: I've added the A / CNAME record, but the domain is still not being added

This can happen due to a few reasons.

1. There is a typo in your domain name \[ _like in the example above_\]

In this scenario, fixing the typo will resolve your issue

2. Your DNS changes haven't been propagated yet.

In this case, you must wait longer and try again after a few hours or the next day to see if it works.

3. Your DNS configuration is not set up correctly.

Please get in touch with your Domain Provider and discuss the errors with their support team.

4. Maybe you have conflicting (multiple) records for the same subdomain \[ _for example, if [blog.mydomain.com](https://blog.mydomain.com/) has a CNAME record pointing to [wp3.msgsndr.com](https://wp3.msgsndr.com/) but it also has an A record pointing to some other provider_\]

In such cases removing the other duplicate record will fix your issue.

## Q4: I can't connect my root domain (ex., [mydomain.com](https://mydomain.com/))

.Please make sure there are no additional AAA, TXT, records, etc if you plan to use that slug/root domain for WordPress

## Q5: How many WordPress sites can I have per sub-account

You can have as many sites you wish to under a single account, there are no limitations :)

## Q6: How can I request to cancel a client's WordPress subscription?

To begin a WordPress Cancellation Request, you must navigate to "Delete Site" under the Advanced settings of your Wordpress Dashboard after you complete the 30-day minimum committment period.
