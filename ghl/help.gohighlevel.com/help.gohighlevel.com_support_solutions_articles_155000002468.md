### **Overview**

Users can now utilize the "Restore Calendar" feature to recover deleted calendars along with their appointments. This functionality fills a crucial gap, allowing users to undo their actions with ease.

Whenever you delete a calendar, all its appointments are also deleted. Many times users delete their calendars and then want to recover the deleted calendar. With the restore functionality, you can now restore your calendar as well as any appointments that were deleted with the calendar.

### **Important Points to Note**

- If you've deleted a calendar, all appointments associated with it are also deleted.
- Appointments deleted within ±30 minutes of the calendar deletion time will be restored.
- Any appointments deleted outside of this timeframe will not be recovered.
- Audit logs are retained for a maximum of 60 days. Ensure timely restoration of deleted calendars to avoid data loss.
- **For example,** if you delete a calendar on May 15th at 10:00 AM, all appointments of that calendar will be immediately deleted as well. These appointments are essentially deleted within a timeframe of 30 minutes from the calendar deletion time. When you restore your calendar, all such deleted appointments will be restored. However, if you had deleted an appointment on May 15th at 9:00 AM, that appointment won't be restored.
- This is essentially done to ensure that only those appointments that were deleted as a result of the calendar deletion are restored, and not those appointments that were deleted by the user at another point in time.
