# Different Websites/ Funnels versions within the system

Modified on: Fri, 17 Dec, 2021 at 5:01 PM

# **What does the different funnel/website versions mean?**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170341512/original/8kystH4_OWZ9VhIBD3A0TdevXBez2WB-lQ.png?1639429035)**

In October of 2021, we introduced an upgrade to page builders (Websites & Funnels) that affected the way they interact with products.

Pages built before this date will not be labeled but are considered Version 1. Pages built after October, 2021 are labeled " **Version 2**" (see image above).

For those who recently joined us, you will only see version 2. Rest assured you're on the fastest and newest version (V2). [**How to upgrade a Version 1 page to****Version 2?**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204164#How-do-I-upgrade-a-Version-1-to-Version-2?)

## **Lets dive into main differences both below**

Version 1 pages are built on the original system builder. The main differences is V2 comes with a few extra features:

- ## **[PayPal Payment Processing](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204158)**


- ## **One step order form**

# **FAQ's**

## **How do I upgrade a Version 1 page to Version 2?**

You can do this by clicking on "copy"

First select your location or up to 3 other locations.

Once you have selected a location the "Clone Funnel" button (blue outline in image below) will be highlighted and clickable.

Hit the "Clone" button and that's it, your website/funnel has been upgraded.
