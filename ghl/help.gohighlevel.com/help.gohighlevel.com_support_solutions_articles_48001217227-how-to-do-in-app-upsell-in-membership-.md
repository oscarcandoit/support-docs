# **What is In-App Upsell**

An In-App Upsell allows you to display additional offers directly within the My Library page of a membership product. When learners log in, they’ll see locked products or course bundles they can choose to purchase separately. This seamless integration lets you cross-sell without disrupting the user’s experience or requiring a separate sales page.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of In-App Upsell**

Unlocking more value from each member visit is easy with in-app upsells. Here’s why it’s a smart monetization tool:

- **Boosts Revenue** by promoting relevant products at key engagement points
- **Enhances Discoverability** of other courses without additional outreach
- **No Checkout Friction** since offers appear within the existing library view
- **Easy Customization** to match your brand identity and upsell goals
- **Trackable Performance** so you know what works and can optimize accordingly

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I add multiple In-App Upsells to the same offer?**

Yes, you can attach multiple In-App Upsells to a single offer. This allows you to showcase different products or bundles on the My Library page and give users more purchasing options.

**Q: Will users see the upsell even if they already purchased it elsewhere?**

No, once a user purchases an offer (even as an upsell), it will no longer appear as locked in their My Library. Only offers they haven’t purchased will remain visible as upsells.

**Q: Can I customize the look and feel of each In-App Upsell page?**

Absolutely. Each upsell offer can be uniquely styled using the built-in editor. You can adjust fonts, colors, layout, descriptions, and instructor details to match your brand.

**Q: What payment methods are supported for In-App Upsells?**

In-App Upsells support any payment methods you’ve configured within your checkout settings, including Stripe and PayPal. The checkout experience remains seamless and secure.
