## What is Media Optimization and Watermarking?

Media Optimization and Watermarking are enhancements within the Social Planner designed to reduce the manual workload involved in preparing visual content for social media platforms. Media Optimization automatically resizes and reformats your uploaded images based on each platform’s specifications. Watermarking applies your pre-configured brand logo or visual identifier to every image in your post, ensuring consistent branding across all platforms.

## Key Benefits of Media Optimization and Watermarking

These tools simplify your publishing workflow and ensure your brand is accurately represented, no matter where your content is shared.

- Automatically formats images to match platform-specific requirements (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)

- Applies your brand watermark to all images in a post

- Enhances visual consistency and prevents off-brand posts

- Reduces reliance on third-party design or editing tools

- Minimizes formatting errors such as improper cropping or rejection due to incompatible dimensions

- Enables fast and consistent mobile publishing for busy teams or agencies


## **Note:** Watermark is not supported for Review Post and RSS Post, all other Post Type is supported for adding watermark.

## How To Use These Features in the Mobile App

Enabling Media Optimization and Watermarking is quick and easy during the post creation process in the mobile app. Follow the steps below to activate these features:

1. Open the Social Planner in the HighLevel or LeadConnector mobile app.

2. Tap Create Post and upload the image(s) you wish to share.

3. Scroll to the Advanced Settings section.

4. Toggle Watermark to apply your pre-configured brand watermark.

5. Toggle Optimize Media for Platforms to automatically format your media based on the publishing platforms selected.

6. Preview your post and select the platforms where you want it published.

7. Tap Publish to complete the process.


## Watermarking on Mobile

Watermarking allows you to apply consistent brand visuals to your content directly from your mobile device, without requiring manual editing or use of external tools.

- The watermark must be configured from the desktop version of the Social Planner before it can be used on mobile.

- Once configured, it will automatically apply to all images in a post when enabled.

- This feature supports all social platforms integrated with the Social Planner.

- The watermark can be turned on or off per post.


## Media Optimization for Social Channels

Each social media platform has unique image dimension requirements. Media Optimization eliminates the need to manually adjust your images by automatically resizing and formatting them to comply with platform standards.

- Supports platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn

- Prevents issues like image cropping, distortion, or upload rejections

- Ensures each image looks optimal and professional on every channel

- Ideal for agencies or users managing multiple brands and platforms
