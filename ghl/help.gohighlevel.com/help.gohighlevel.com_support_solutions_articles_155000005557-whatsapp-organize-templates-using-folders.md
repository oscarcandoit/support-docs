## **What is WhatsApp Template Folders?**

WhatsApp Template Folders is a new organizational tool within HighLevel that allows users to create custom folders and subfolders for WhatsApp templates. Instead of a single, flat list, you can now categorize templates by use case, campaign, or any structure that fits your workflow. This helps teams quickly locate, manage, and update templates, especially as your template library grows.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of WhatsApp Template Folders**

Organizing your WhatsApp templates with folders brings several practical advantages:

- **Improved Organization:** Group templates by campaign, department, or use case for quick access.

- **Custom Hierarchies:** Nest folders inside folders to mirror your team’s structure or marketing flows.

- **Faster Template Management:** Add, move, or locate templates without scrolling through long lists.

- **On-the-Fly Folder Creation:** Create folders while moving templates or folders, making organization flexible and intuitive.

- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Always see your current folder path, making it easy to navigate complex folder structures.

- **Enhanced Reporting:** Delivered Message Count and Weekly Delivery Trends are now visible directly on the templates table for instant insights.

**Q: Can I rename or delete folders after creating them?**

Yes, right-click or use the three-dot menu on any folder to rename or delete it.

**Q: Can I share folders between users or teams?** Folders follow account-level access permissions. If a team member has access to WhatsApp templates, they can view all folders.

**Q: What happens if I delete a folder with templates inside?**

The templates will be moved to the parent folder, ensuring no data is lost.
