# Courses: Pick a Video Frame as Lesson Thumbnail

Modified on: Fri, 26 Sep, 2025 at 7:18 AM

Make your HighLevel course content stand out by setting a compelling thumbnail for each lesson. You can either capture an exact frame from your uploaded video or upload a custom image. Clear thumbnails improve navigation, boost click-through rates, and keep your branding consistent across lessons.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Video Frame Thumbnails**

Choosing a thumbnail strategically helps learners recognize content quickly, improves perceived production value, and supports a consistent brand experience across your course library.

- **Brand consistency**: Keep lesson visuals aligned with your brand style and course theme.

- **Higher engagement**: Use dynamic, relevant frames to attract more plays and reduce bounce.

- **Faster workflow**: Set a thumbnail in a click without leaving HighLevel or using external editors.

- **Improved navigation**: Distinct thumbnails make it easier for learners to find the right lesson.


* * *

## **Where Thumbnails Display (Lesson vs. Video)**

Understanding where your chosen image appears helps you set expectations for the learner experience and maintain consistency.

- After saving, the selected image appears as the **Lesson thumbnail** and the **Video thumbnail** inside that lesson.

- Want a different image for the lesson tile than the video player? Upload a separate **lesson thumbnail** image to override it.


* * *

## **Requirements & Limitations**

Ensure you’re working within supported scenarios so the thumbnail you select behaves as expected.

- Works with **videos uploaded directly** to the lesson in HighLevel.

- For lessons using **embedded third‑party players**, select **Upload custom thumbnail** to control the lesson tile image.

- Always click **Save** to confirm your thumbnail selection.


* * *

## **Best Practices for Effective Thumbnails**

Thoughtful thumbnail design improves learner clarity and course professionalism, especially for longer programs.

- Use clear subject matter (speaker face, key graphic, or product) centered in frame.

- Add minimal, readable text if needed (3–5 words max) to communicate the lesson’s focus.

- Ensure good contrast and sharpness; avoid dark, blurry, or busy frames.

- Keep visual style consistent across lessons (colors, typography, framing).

## **How To Setup a Lesson Thumbnail**

Following a simple, repeatable process ensures your thumbnail updates consistently and displays correctly in both the lesson and video contexts.

1. Go to **Sites > Memberships > Courses** and open your course.

2. Select the **Lesson** you want to edit and upload the video.

3. **Choose a frame**: Play to the desired moment, pause, then click **Use current frame as thumbnail**.





   - Confirm the preview updates.

   - Click **Save** in the lesson editor.

4. **Important - Lesson vs. Video Thumbnail**





   - Selecting **Use current frame as thumbnail** sets both the **Video thumbnail (1)** (the image shown before playback) and **Lesson thumbnail (2)** (the image on the course/lesson tile)

   - To use different images:





     1. Keep your chosen frame for the **Video thumbnail** inside the lesson.

     2. For the **Lesson thumbnail** (course/lesson tile), either:


        Switch to **Lesson thumbnail** and choose a different **video frame** (pause on the moment and click **Use current frame as thumbnail** again), or



        **Upload** a separate image in the lesson details/thumbnail settings.
5. Return to your course list to confirm the **Lesson** and **Video** thumbnails match your selection.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does selecting a video frame also set the thumbnail inside the video player?**

A: Yes. After you save, the image is used as both the Lesson and Video thumbnail for that lesson.

**Q: Can I upload a different image for the lesson tile than the video player?**

A: Yes. Upload a dedicated lesson thumbnail to override the shared image, while keeping a different video thumbnail if needed.

**Q: Does this work with embedded videos like YouTube or Vimeo?**

A: The “Use current frame as thumbnail” option applies to videos uploaded to HighLevel. For embedded players, upload a custom lesson thumbnail image to control the lesson tile.

**Q: What image size should I use for best results?**

A: Use a 16:9 image (1280×720 or larger), optimized for clarity and contrast.

**Q: Will changing the thumbnail affect existing students?**

A: Yes, once saved, new and returning learners will see the updated thumbnail anywhere it appears.

**Q: Can I change the thumbnail later?**

A: Absolutely. Repeat the selection or upload process and **Save** to apply the new image.
