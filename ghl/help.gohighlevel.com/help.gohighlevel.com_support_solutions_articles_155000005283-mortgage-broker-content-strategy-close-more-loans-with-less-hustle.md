## Why This Playbook Matters

82% of homebuyers start their mortgage journey online before speaking to a broker. If your content isn’t showing up in their feed, inbox, or search results—you’re losing deals before they even reach out.

Most brokers:

- Rely on referrals but aren’t consistently top-of-mind.

- Post sporadically without a strategic plan.

- Don’t know which content actually converts browsers into borrowers.

- Fail to leverage automation to stay visible 24/7.


This playbook will help you fix that by giving you a **clear, tested roadmap** to:

✅ Build local trust and stand out from competitors

✅ Capture high-intent homebuyer and refinance leads

✅ Nurture long-term relationships for repeat/referral business

✅ Automate content, follow-ups, and visibility—so you close more, with less work

## What You’ll Learn

- The 4 content types every broker needs to publish

- Platform-specific strategies that generate leads

- How to write content that builds authority & drives calls

- Metrics that matter (and how to track them)

- How HighLevel automates all of this for you


* * *

## Step 1: Know the Content That Drives Leads

### Why It Matters

Posting randomly isn’t a strategy. A structured content system ensures you attract and convert serious buyers, investors, and refinance clients.

### 1.1 The Four Core Content Types

| Content Type | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Educational** | Build trust by simplifying complex mortgage concepts | “Fixed vs. Adjustable Rates: What’s Right for You?” |
| **Engagement-Driven** | Boost reach and visibility through interaction | “What’s your biggest fear about getting a mortgage?” |
| **Promotional** | Highlight services & offers that generate direct leads | “Free 15-min Pre-Approval Consult — This Week Only!” |
| **Social Proof** | Showcase real wins to build credibility | “Helped Sarah save $12K by refinancing her FHA loan!” |

> **Pro Tip:** Use the **80/20 Rule** → 80% value / 20% direct pitch

* * *

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Strategy

### Why It Matters

Every platform attracts different parts of your audience. Tailor your content to each one.

| Platform | Best Content | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Facebook** | Testimonials, short videos, Q&A, promos | 3–5x per week |
| **Instagram** | Reels, homeownership tips, lifestyle posts | 5–7x per week |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B partnerships, market insights | 2–3x per week |
| **YouTube** | Deep-dive explainers, market trend videos | 1–2x per week |
| **TikTok** | Fast tips, myths vs. facts, behind the scenes | 3–5x per week |
| **Google Business Profile** | Offers, client success, reviews | 2–4x per month |
| **Blog / Email** | Market updates, case studies | 2x per month |
| **Offline (flyers/newsletters)** | Rates, team highlights, promos | Quarterly or seasonal |

**Metric**: Businesses that post 3–5x/week on social convert 2–3x more leads than those who post less.

## Step 3: Create High-Converting Content

### Why It Matters

Great content has a structure: **Hook + Value + Call-to-Action.**

### 3.1 Winning Content Formula

**Hook:** “Think rates are too high to buy a home?”

**Value:** “You might qualify for a 3% down first-time buyer program.”

**CTA:** “DM me for a 60-second prequal check.”

* * *

### 3.2 Example Posts by Type

| Post Type | Headline | CTA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Educational** | “Confused by mortgage points? Here’s how they can save you thousands.” | “Book a free mortgage strategy session.” |
| **Engagement** | “What was your first home interest rate? Comment below!” | “We’ll share results in a follow-up post!” |
| **Promotional** | “Rates Dropped Today! Check your buying power with no credit pull.” | “Text ‘RATE’ to 55555 to start.” |
| **Social Proof** | “Just closed a $1.2M loan in 11 days with no delays.” | “Read more success stories on our site.” |

* * *

## Step 4: Measure & Optimize

### Why It Matters

If you don’t track it, you can’t scale it.

| Metric | What It Tells You |
| --- | --- |
| **Engagement Rate** | Are people interacting? |
| **Click-Through Rate** | Are they taking action? |
| **Conversion Rate** | Are they becoming leads or calls? |
| **Lead Response Time** | Are you following up fast enough? |

> ✅ Brokers who respond within **5 minutes** of a lead converting are **9x more likely to close**.

* * *

## Step 5: Automate with HighLevel

### Why It Matters

You’re busy doing deals. Let your systems market for you.

| --- | --- |
| **Content Scheduler** | Pre-plan posts for weeks at a time across channels |

| **Lead Capture Forms** | Collect data directly from posts, popups, SMS |
| **CRM & Smart Lists** | Track and nurture leads by stage (refi, pre-approval, investor, etc.) |
| **Review Requests** | Get more Google reviews → rank higher locally |
| **Email/SMS Drips** | Nurture cold leads & stay top-of-mind |
| **Offline Printing** | Generate high-converting postcards, flyers from same dashboard |

* * *

## Final Thoughts: Content Is the New Cold Call

A great content strategy can:

✅ Position you as the go-to mortgage expert in your area

✅ Turn strangers into pre-approvals

✅ Keep your pipeline full, even during rate volatility

✅ Help you scale without burning out

Visibility = Trust

Engagement = Appointments

Consistency = Closings
