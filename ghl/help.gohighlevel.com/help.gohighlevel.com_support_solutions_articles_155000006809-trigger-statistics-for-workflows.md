# Trigger Statistics for Workflows

Modified on: Mon, 17 Nov, 2025 at 12:16 PM

Trigger Stats gives you real-time visibility into how each workflow trigger is performing in HighLevel. See Attempted, Matched, and Unmatched counts at a glance, drill into contact-level reasons for mismatches, and filter results to validate logic quickly.

# **What are Trigger Statistics?**

Trigger Stats is a diagnostic view inside the Workflow Builder that measures whether contacts qualified for each trigger. It surfaces totals (Attempted, Matched, Unmatched) and lets you click into a detailed panel to see the exact reason a contact did or did not match so you can fix filters, update data, and confirm changes without leaving the builder.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Trigger Stats**

- **Faster Debugging:** Real-time counts reveal which triggers aren’t matching as expected.

- **Contact-Level Clarity:** Open a panel with the contact, timestamp, match status, and the reason for unmatch.

- **Actionable Reasons:** Review the Top Reasons for Unmatch (e.g., filter mismatch, missing values) to prioritize fixes.

- **Immediate Validation:** Adjust trigger filters and watch the stats update live as new events occur.

- **Targeted Analysis:** Filter by date range or search a specific contact to isolate anomalies.

- **Confidence in Logic:** Reduce guesswork and ensure the right contacts enter the right workflows.


* * *

## **Trigger-Level Performance Metrics**

Instantly understand trigger effectiveness. Each trigger card in Stats View displays:

- Attempted – total contacts evaluated.

- Matched – contacts that met all conditions.

- Unmatched – contacts that did not qualify.

* * *

## **Trigger Stats Panel**

Click any metric to open a side panel packed with diagnostic details so you can fix issues without leaving the builder. What you’ll find:

- Contact name, email, and evaluation timestamp.

- Match status for each contact.

- Top 10 reasons a contact didn’t match (e.g., value mismatch, missing field).

- Search bar and date-range filter for laser-focused analysis.

* * *

## **Real-Time Analysis & Smart Filters**

Trigger Stats updates live as events occur, so you can test a change, watch the numbers move, and confirm your fix immediately. Use built-in date and contact filters to isolate specific timeframes or individuals, ideal for studying spikes or validating test records.

## **How To Use Trigger Stats**

#### **Step 1:** Open the Workflow

Navigate to **Automations → Workflows**, then open any workflow you want to analyze.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057143465/original/glNKTEOdVo7NzrxCScsEFuSZFXFt_5krEQ.png?1761757746)

#### **Step 2:** Switch to Stats View

Use the **Stats** tab at the top of the builder to load trigger-level metrics.

```
Note: A banner indicates the workflow is not editable in Stats View.
```

#### **Step 3:** Drill into a Trigger

Click the **Attempted**, **Matched**, or **Unmatched** number on a trigger card to open the Trigger Stats panel.

1. **Filter and validate.**





   - Apply a **date range** or **Select Contact** to focus your analysis.

   - Compare **Received value** vs **Expected value** in the Reason for Unmatch to identify mismatches.
2. **Adjust logic and re-check.**





   - Return to **Builder** (edit mode), update trigger filters or data standards, then switch back to **Stats** to confirm improvement.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How often do the numbers refresh?**

Stats update in real time; you’ll typically see new attempts within seconds of the triggering event.

**Q: Does Trigger Stats change how triggers fire?**

No. It only adds visibility; trigger logic and execution remain unchanged.

**Q: What counts as “Attempted”?**

Any contact evaluated by the trigger, whether it matched the filters or not, adds one to the Attempted tally.

**Q: How long is data retained?**

The Trigger Stats panel stores data for the last 30 days.
