# **What is the Typeform Integration in Workflows?**

HighLevel’s native Typeform integration lets you react to Typeform submissions instantly and perform Typeform tasks directly from a workflow. Use the **New Entry (Instant)** trigger to start automations the moment a form is submitted, and add Typeform **actions** (like creating or duplicating a form, or searching responses) to streamline onboarding, feedback collection, and CRM enrichment.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Typeform Integration**

These benefits highlight how HighLevel and Typeform work together to route leads faster, reduce manual tasks, and centralize operations in one automation hub.

- **Instant routing**: start workflows the moment a Typeform is submitted—no polling delays.

- **Form ops at scale**: create or duplicate forms during an automation so each client/project has its own copy.

- **Response utilization**: search historic responses to personalize follow‑ups and enrich CRM data.

- **Reduced context‑switching**: work inside HighLevel—no jumping between tools for common form tasks.

- **Predictable billing**: premium executions are billed per run and can be rebilled to sub‑accounts (see [Workflows Pro Plan – New Pricing Tiers](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003971-workflows-pro-plan-new-pricing-tiers) and [How to enable and rebill Premium Features for Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005678-how-to-enable-and-rebill-premium-features-for-workflows)).

## **Triggers & Actions**

This overview consolidates the Typeform **trigger** and **actions** in one place so you can quickly compare capabilities, required inputs, and the data each step returns for downstream mapping.

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger | **New Entry (Instant)** | Fires immediately when a Typeform submission is received and enrolls the record into the workflow. |
| Action | **Create Empty Form** | Creates a new blank Typeform in the connected workspace and returns the new Form ID/URL. |
| Action | **Duplicate Existing Form** | Clones an existing Typeform (structure/logic/design) and returns the new Form ID/URL. |
| Action | **Search Responses in a Form** | Retrieves existing submissions for a selected Typeform so you can branch logic and map fields. |

* * *

## **How To Set Up the Typeform Integration**

A clean connection and correct mapping ensure instant enrollments and reliable downstream actions. Use the options below to connect quickly and verify with a live test.

**Connect Typeform (two paths)**

1. **From a Trigger/Action step**

   - In **Workflows → (Open/Create) Workflow**, click **\+ Add Trigger** and search **Typeform** _or_ click **\+ Add Action** and search **Typeform**.

   - Choose **New Entry (Instant)** (trigger) or a **Typeform action**, then click **Connect Now**.

   - Sign in to Typeform and authorize HighLevel.

2. **From Settings → Integrations**

   - Go to **Settings → Integrations**, locate **Typeform**, and complete the OAuth connection (connections are per sub‑account; see **[Marketplace Apps – Managing External Connections](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004585-marketplace-apps-managing-external-connections)**).



     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057111647/original/ELK9XGF2B_8eh0NXXbgsoxzTnF4VN9ZvfA.png?1761743838)

### **Build your first flow:**

1. From the desired **sub‑account**, go to **Automations → Workflows** and click **Create Workflow** (or open an existing workflow).

2. Add **New Entry (Instant) Trigger** and select the form.

3. Add Typeform Actions **Create/Update Contact**; map email/phone from the submission.

4. Add follow‑ups (e.g., **Send Email**, **Notify User**, **Create Opportunity**).

5. **Publish** and submit the Typeform once to verify entries appear in **Execution Logs**


* * *

## **Use Cases**

**Use Case 1: Create Tasks and Notify Team from Typeform Submissions**

**Goal**: Automatically create a ClickUp task, update the contact field, and send an internal notification when someone submits a Typeform entry.

**Workflow Setup:**

- **Trigger**: Typeform → New Entry (Instant)
- **Filter:** Form Name = “Client Onboarding Form”
- **Actions:**
  - Create Task (ClickUp)
  - Update Contact Field (workflows)
  - Send Internal Notification (workflows)

**Example:** A new client fills out your “Client Onboarding Form” in Typeform. Instantly, a ClickUp task is created with the client’s details, their contact field in workflows is updated with the latest information, and your internal team receives a notification to begin the onboarding process.

**Use Case 2: Create Conditional Tasks and Send Notifications from Typeform Submissions**

**Goal**: Automatically create a new document, check form response values, and trigger different follow-up actions based on the number of items submitted in a Typeform entry.

**Workflow Setup:**

- **Trigger**: Typeform → New Entry (Instant)
- **Filter**: Form Name = “Order Submission Form”
- **Actions**:
  - Create New Document (ClickUp)
  - Condition: Check if “total\_items” equals “3”
  - Branch (If True):
    - Update Contact Field (workflows)
    - Send Internal Notification (workflows)
    - Send Email (workflows)
  - Branch (If False):
    - End Workflow

**Example**:

A customer submits an order through your “Order Submission Form” on Typeform. The workflow creates a new document in ClickUp with their order details. If the customer ordered exactly three items, the contact record is updated, the operations team is notified internally, and a confirmation email is sent to the customer. If the total items are not three, the workflow ends without additional actions.

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057111954/original/9ZBEUuEnYxDadIjJM0UYWq-ZaNwjhnyqmw.png?1761744016)**

**Use Case 3: Automate Document Creation and Notifications on Pipeline Stage Change**

**Goal**: Automatically check for existing form responses when a deal’s pipeline stage changes, create or duplicate documents accordingly, and notify the team or contact based on the outcome.

**Workflow Setup:**

- **Trigger**: Pipeline Stage Changed (CRM)
- **Filter**: Pipeline = “Client Onboarding Pipeline”
- **Actions**:
  - Search Responses in a Form (Typeform)
  - **Branch**(Responses Found):
    - Create New Document (ClickUp)
    - Update Contact Field (workflows)
    - Send Internal Notification (workflows)
    - Send Email (workflows)
  - **Branch**(Responses Not Found):
    - Duplicate Existing Form (Typeform)
    - Send Internal Notification (workflows)
    - Send Email (workflows)

**Example**:

When a deal moves to the “Onboarding” stage in your CRM pipeline, the workflow searches for existing Typeform responses linked to the client.

- If a response is found, a new document is created in ClickUp with the client’s data, their contact record is updated, and both your team and the client are notified.

- If no response is found, a new copy of the onboarding form is created for the client to fill out, followed by an internal notification to your team and an email prompt sent to the client.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need a paid Typeform plan?**

The integration works with free and paid Typeform accounts. Typeform’s own plan limits (e.g., response caps, branding) still apply.

**Q: Is this integration available to all users?**Yes, it’s available to all accounts that have access to workflows and integrations.

**Q: Are the Typeform steps premium‑billed in HighLevel?**

Yes. The **Typeform trigger and actions** are premium and billed per execution at your account’s standard rate. Agencies can optionally rebill sub‑accounts.

**Q: Where do new/duplicated forms live?**

Forms are created in the connected Typeform workspace tied to the OAuth account selected for that step.

**Q: Can I edit questions of an existing Typeform from a workflow?**

Not at this time. Current actions include **Create Empty Form**, **Duplicate Existing Form**, and **Search Responses in a Form**.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot failures?**

Check **Execution Logs** for the specific step error (e.g., invalid form ID, missing permissions). If authorization expired, reconnect the Typeform app and re‑run a test.
