# **What Is a Popup That Shows on Page Load?**

A page load popup is a type of message or form that automatically appears shortly after a visitor arrives on your website or funnel page—without them clicking or scrolling. This kind of popup is triggered by a timing setting (like a 2-second delay) and is used to grab the visitor’s attention right away. It’s commonly used to promote time-sensitive offers, capture leads, or display welcome messages that encourage action early in the visit.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using a Page Load Popup**

- **Automation:** Automatically launch popups without requiring the user to click anything.

- **Lead generation:** Perfect for growing email lists or offering limited-time deals the moment a user lands.

- **Conversion optimization:** Use immediate popups to boost funnel conversions with time-sensitive CTAs.

- **Behavior targeting:** Choose exactly when the popup should appear with a customizable delay timer.

- **Broad compatibility:** Works on both Funnels and Websites inside the HighLevel platform.

## **How to Set a Popup to Show on Page Load**

Follow these steps to configure a popup that automatically appears after a user lands on a page.

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Popup Settings

- In the left-hand menu of your sub-account dashboard, click on **Sites**. Then choose either Funnels or Websites tab in the upper navigation bar.

- Open your chosen funnel or website and click on the specific step or page where the popup should be added.

- Click the blue button labeled **Edit** to launch the page editor.

- In the top menu bar of the website builder, click the **Popup** **Settings** icon to open the popup settings.

**Step 2:** Configure the Popup Settings

- In the Popup Settings panel on the right side, scroll down to find the Show Popup on dropdown. Select **Delay** from the list.

- Use the slider just below the dropdown to select how many seconds after page load the popup should appear.

- Click **Save** or **Publish** in the top-right corner of the editor to apply the popup settings.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I set the popup to show only once per visit or session?**

No, the popup will appear each time the page loads unless the visitor stays on the same page.

**Q: What if I want the popup to show when someone tries to leave?**

Use the "Exit" option on the "Show popup on" dropdown to create a popup that triggers when the user moves their cursor toward the browser toolbar.

**Q: Can I use this on both Funnels and Websites?**

Yes! The feature works identically for both, and the setup process is exactly the same.

**Q: What happens if the popup is opened manually before the delay time is reached?**

If the popup is triggered manually (e.g., by a button click) before the delay timer finishes, the automatic popup will be canceled. This prevents the same popup from appearing twice during the same page view.
