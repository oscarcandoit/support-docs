## **How to get a Document signed and collect payment immediately?**

Make it easy for clients to **sign a document and pay in one flow**.

1\. Add a product list -> Enable Direct Payments -> Send the document -> User signs and gets redirected to invoice immediately

* * *

## Send from a **New Document**

1. Go to **Payments › Documents & Contracts › New Document**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051365192/original/Vc1wvMN6oETE-ZfL0WmBUl5YOBBL-lyvyw.png?1754927243)

2. Add a the **Primary signer**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051366150/original/yOa2RSTtVxoTgsulKr-slgKZelwoZszJ2g.png?1754927718)

3. **Add Product List**. Item types determine whether the list is **One‑time** or **Recurring**; **tags** appear automatically.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051366166/original/JCxJUNJo-GPfNfUveyySJsp7N7q-NHoV3A.png?1754927734)

1. If a One time product is added - The invoice type is set to One time.

      \- You can select a product and change it to an optional item and make its quantities editable if needed from the properties section in the right.

      \- From the Payments section in the left side - you can set the configurations as per your need.

      ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051366432/original/bhM_qquIzDeGHIaeNvYDXLWPjyCP0u23cQ.png?1754927827)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051366606/original/jTxRkj0ltdrXRljZlzTpKmYOovynXZ20xA.png?1754927890)

2. If one or more recurring product is added in the product list -> the invoice type changes to Recurring. One document can only have one recurring frequency which can be chosen from the Invoice frequency settings in the left.

      ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051366786/original/3I3qx7U4b4K_DFgdFusKaZgxiZVMbtJN8A.png?1754928032)

4. Pick configurations you need (see quick callouts; full details in **Configurations** below):

   - **Direct Payment — ON:** Redirect primary signer to pay **after signing** if an invoice exists at signing.

   - **Send Invoice — ON:** Email the invoice when it’s generated (at signing or on the schedule).

   - **Auto‑Payment — ON:** Autocharge future recurring invoices.

   - **Live Mode = true:** Real transactions; **false** for test/dry‑run.
5. **Send** the document.

6. **What happens at signing**

   - **One‑time:** Primary signer is **redirected to invoice** to pay immediately.

   - **Recurring (start = at signing):** Primary signer is **redirected** to pay the first invoice immediately.

   - **Recurring (start = later):** No redirect at signing; first invoice is created/sent on the schedule.

   - Only the **primary signer** is redirected. Others just sign. An invoice email is also sent when enabled.

     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051377750/original/sB6OGo-MXbkH1NKMODO-DsO_q2rRCSntPQ.png?1754936646)

## Configurations

### Direct Payment

- **ON:** If an invoice exists at signing, the **primary signer** is redirected to the invoice page immediately after signing; invoice email also goes out.

- **OFF:** No redirect; payer uses the emailed invoice (or you send it later from drafts).


### Send Invoice

- **ON:** Automatically emails the invoice when generated (at signing or on schedule).

- **OFF:** Keeps the invoice as **draft** so you can review and send manually.


### Auto‑Payment

- **ON:** Saves card (supported gateways) and **autocharges** subsequent invoices in the recurring schedule or ones with payment schedules.

- **OFF:** Payer pays each issued invoice manually.


> Auto‑Payment affects **recurring** schedules. One‑time is paid during the immediate checkout.

### Live Mode (true/false)

- **true (Live):** Real charges with your live credentials.

- **false (Test):** Test flow without collecting real funds (availability depends on gateway test mode).


## How to Automate 2 in 1 Documents: Save as a **Template** & Automate with **Send Documents & Contracts** Action

1. Go to **Payments › Documents & Contracts › Templates › New Template**.

2. Insert **Signature** fields and **Add Product List** (types + tags auto).

3. For recurring, choose **when** the schedule starts: **at signing** or on a **future date/day**.

4. Configure **Direct Payment / Send Invoice / Auto‑Payment / Live Mode** as needed.

5. **Save** the template.

6. Open **Workflows** → add **Action: Send Documents & Contracts** → select your template. Once the workflow is triggered, the signer receives the document. Once Primary user signs the document -> they are redirected to the invoice if direct payments were enabled.

7. **What happens at signing** (same rules):

   - One‑time or Recurring (start = at signing) → **redirect** primary signer to pay.

   - Recurring (start = later) → **no redirect**; first invoice arrives per schedule.

## Tracking

- **Payments › Documents & Contracts:** Document + signing + payment status in one place.

- **Payments › Invoices:** Each invoice record and payment status (including recurring schedule progress and auto‑payment results).


## Tips & Edge Cases

- **Weekly example:** If the schedule is **every Thursday** and signing completes on Thursday, the first invoice is generated **immediately** → redirect applies. Otherwise, the first invoice is sent on the **next Thursday**.

- **Multiple recipients:** Only the **primary signer** is redirected to pay.

- **Setup fees:** Show as a **one‑time** line on the first invoice; only the recurring line continues.

- **Mixing items:** One‑time items bill on the first invoice; recurring items follow the schedule.

## FAQs

1. **Why didn’t my client get redirected after signing?**

Either **Direct Payment** is OFF, or there wasn’t an invoice **at signing** (e.g., recurring starts later). Enable Direct Payment and, for recurring, set start = **at signing**.
2. **Where do I track progress?**

In **Documents & Contracts** (document-level status) and **Invoices** (invoice/payment status, schedules, auto‑payment results).
3. **Can I mix one‑time and recurring items?**

Yes. The product list tags show types. One‑time bills first; recurring continues as per the schedule.
