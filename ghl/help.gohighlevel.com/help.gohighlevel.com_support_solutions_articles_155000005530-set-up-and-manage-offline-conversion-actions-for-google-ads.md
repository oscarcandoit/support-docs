# **What is the Google Ads Conversion Actions?**

The Google Ads Conversion Action is a HighLevel Ad Manager feature that lets users set up and manage Google Ads offline conversion actions without leaving the HighLevel platform. Offline conversions are actions—like leads, purchases, or form submissions—that happen outside your website or app, and are crucial for tracking the full customer journey. This allows you to seamlessly create, edit, and view these conversion actions, ensuring your Google Ads reporting matches your HighLevel workflows.

* * *

# **Key Benefits of Google Ads Conversion Action**

Unlocking this feature brings several advantages to your ad management process:

- **Seamless Setup**: No need to switch to the Google Ads interface—everything is managed within HighLevel.

- **Consistent Tracking**: Ensures your Google Ads conversions align with HighLevel workflow events.

- **Time-Saving**: Quickly create and manage conversions in just a few clicks.

- **Advanced Reporting**: Enables better optimization and attribution for offline conversions.

- **Centralized Management**: View and edit all conversion actions (existing and new) in one place.

- **Automatic Sync**: Conversions created in HighLevel are instantly available in your connected Google Ads account.

# **Create and Manage Google Ads Offline Conversion Actions**

Setting up Google Ads offline conversion actions in HighLevel is straightforward and ensures your campaigns are accurately tracked from the start.

### **Access Ad Manager**

Navigate to the **Marketing** section from the main left-hand menu, then click on **Ad Manager** in the top navigation bar. This will take you to the campaign dashboard where your ad tools are located.

### **Open Ad Manager Settings**

In the Ad Manager dashboard, click the **gear icon** located next to the “Create Campaign” button. This opens the Ad Manager settings where you can configure conversion tracking and platform preferences.

### **Select Google Ads Conversions**

Inside the Ad Manager settings, click on **Google Ads** under Platform Settings, then switch to the **Conversions** tab. This view displays all your synced and newly created Google Ads conversion actions in one list.

### **Create a New Conversion**

Click the **“\+ Create a new conversion”** button in the top-right corner of the Conversions screen. This opens a form where you can define a new offline conversion action for your Google Ads account.

### **Enter Conversion Name**

At the top of the form, give your conversion a clear and descriptive name. This helps you easily identify it later in reports and workflows.

**Example:**Qualified Lead - Consultation Booking

### **Choose Conversion Source**

Select a relevant **conversion source** from the dropdown menu. Options include Converted lead, Qualified lead, Purchase, Signup, and more. Choose the one that best matches the action you’re tracking.

### **Set Conversion Count**

Choose how conversions are counted per ad click. Use **Many per click** for purchases or repeatable actions, or **One per click** for leads or one-time form submissions to prevent duplicates.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048534087/original/8xBorDJG51iIng9SoTdvYa1BNDahP3ReOw.png?1750326799)

### **Conversion Value**

Choose **Use same value for each conversion** to apply a fixed dollar amount to every conversion. This is ideal if all conversions deliver similar business value—like a flat fee per lead or purchase.

#### **Use same value for each conversion**

This option lets you apply a fixed monetary value to every conversion. You’ll need to enter a Value (e.g., 50) and select a Currency Code (e.g., USD). It’s ideal when all conversions have roughly the same worth — such as when each lead, booking, or sale contributes consistent revenue.

#### **Use different value for each conversion**

Choose this when each conversion might have a different revenue value — for example, sales of varying amounts. You’ll still need to enter a default Value and Currency Code, which will be used if no custom value is provided. To fully utilize this option, custom values must be sent during upload through workflows or other integrations like CRM or Zapier.

#### **Do not use value for this conversion action**

This option tracks conversions purely by count, without assigning any monetary value. It disables the value and currency fields, making setup simple. Use this when your goal is to measure user actions like signups or downloads, rather than calculate revenue or return on ad spend (ROAS).

### **Conversion Window**

Choose how long after an ad click a conversion should be counted. You can select a timeframe from the dropdown — such as 30, 60, or 90 days, or set a custom duration. This defines how far back Google Ads will look to attribute a conversion to a click.

### **Save the Conversion Action**

Once all fields are filled out, click the **Create** button to save your new offline conversion action. It will be instantly synced with your connected Google Ads account and available for tracking and reporting.
