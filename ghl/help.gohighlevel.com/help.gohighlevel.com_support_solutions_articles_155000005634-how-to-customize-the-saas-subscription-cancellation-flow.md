# **What is the Custom SaaS Cancellation Flow?**

Custom Cancellation Flow replaces the default “one-click cancel” with a branded, multi-step journey. At each stage—reason collection, discount offer, external redirect—you decide the wording, incentives, and next actions, ensuring clients encounter an intentional retention experience instead of an abrupt exit.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Custom Cancellation Flow**

- **Capture Exit Insights**: Gather structured and open-ended cancellation reasons to inform product, pricing, and onboarding improvements.

- **Reduce Churn**: Present time-bound percentage discounts during the exit flow to persuade wavering clients to remain subscribed.

- **Drive High-Touch Saves**: Redirect cancel-clickers to external concierge pages, surveys, or booking links for personalized retention efforts.

- **Maintain Full Visibility**: Track every cancellation attempt or deflection in real-time Activity Logs for transparent reporting and coaching.

- **Iterate Without Code**: Update reasons, offers, and copy on demand, enabling rapid A/B testing of retention tactics, without the need for coding

* * *

## **Global Toggle — Allow Clients to Cancel Subscription**

Turning this master switch **ON** reveals the “Modify / Cancel” button inside every sub‑account’s Billing Dashboard. Turning it **OFF** hides all cancellation options, deferring control entirely to the agency.

- Location: **Agency View** **→ SaaS Configurator → Cancellation Settings**

- Default state for new SaaS businesses: **OFF**

- Changes take effect immediately after **Save**


**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049729631/original/c4U9EzbLVlpHLypPREqGmcFODpPs7OG9jg.png?1752242877)**

* * *

## **Manage Cancellation Reasons**

Collecting specific exit feedback helps you identify pricing objections, feature gaps, or onboarding challenges. Here you can configure a list of reasons that your clients will see when they attempt to cancel their SaaS subscription.

To customize reasons:

1. Go to **SaaS Configurator → Cancellation Settings**

2. Under **Manage Cancellation Reason**, choose from existing defaults or add new ones

3. Click the ✏️ icon to edit any listed reason or ➕ to add a new one

4. The **"Other"** option is always included and allows your customers to type a free-text response

* * *

## **Offer Discount to Retain Clients**

You can try to save the customer by offering a **discount** before they confirm cancellation.

A well‑timed price break can nudge users to stay and explore more value before deciding. HighLevel automatically applies the coupon on the next billing cycle.

To enable this:

1. Toggle on **Enable Discount Offer**

2. Set:





   - **Discount %** (e.g., 25%)

   - **Discount Duration** (e.g., 3 months for monthly plans)
3. Optionally allow users to **receive the offer more than once**

4. When a customer accepts the offer, it’s **automatically applied** to their next billing cycle

5. Customers who accept will be **deflected** from cancellation


```
⚠️ This feature is currently available for V1 sub-accounts only
```

* * *

## **Redirect Users to an External Page**

If you want to handle cancellation logic outside the platform (e.g., on your own site), you can redirect users. This can be used for more advanced off-boarding flows, surveys, or saving attempts.

Steps:

1. Under **Redirect to External Page**, enter a valid URL

2. When enabled, users will be taken to this page immediately after selecting a cancellation reason

3. The cancellation will **not** complete within HighLevel

* * *

## **Track Cancellation Activity with Activity Logs**

All cancellation attempts are logged for visibility and analysis. This gives you actionable insights into **churn patterns** and **retention performance**.

To view logs:

1. Scroll to the **Activity Logs** section

2. View:





   - **Sub-account name & user**

   - **Timestamp**

   - **Plan details**

   - **Cancellation reason**

   - **Outcome (Cancelled / Deflected)**

   - **Detection type** (e.g., coupon, redirect)
3. Use the **Download** button for exporting the log

* * *

## **Preview the Cancellation Flow**

Before enabling the flow for your clients, you can simulate it using **Preview Mode**. Preview Mode reproduces the full client‑side journey in a safe sandbox, letting you double‑check copy, coupon math, and redirect destinations. No coupons are issued and no log entries are created while in Preview. This ensures a smooth and polished cancellation experience before going live.

How to preview:

1. Click **Preview** (top right of Cancellation Settings)

2. Navigate through each step as your customer would see it

3. Use this to validate text, offers, and logic flow


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can a client accept the discount more than once?**

Yes. Check Allow Sub‑Accounts to receive discount offer more than once in Discount settings.

**Q: What happens if I enable an external redirect and the user closes the browser?**

The subscription remains active because the in‑app cancellation step was bypassed. The Activity Log will list Deflected – External Link.

**Q: Where can I see which team member tried to cancel?**

Check the User column in Activity Logs for the exact sub‑account admin.

**Q: Can I export the Cancellation Activity Log for auditing or reporting?**

Yes. Click Download in Activity Logs to export a CSV that includes every cancellation and deflection event, along with reasons and user data.

**Q: Does Preview Mode create real coupons or log entries?**

No. Preview runs in a sandbox environment. It displays the full flow for review but does not issue coupons, change subscription status, or write to Activity Logs.

**Q: Are deflection events recorded even when the client ultimately keeps the subscription?**

Yes. Activity Logs list every attempt, including deflections caused by discount acceptance or external redirect, so you always see total churn‑pressure volume.
