# Business Profile Settings - Business Physical Address

Modified on: Fri, 29 Aug, 2025 at 3:52 PM

Your Business Physical Address is a very important component of your Business Profile. This information not only can be used when verifying your business for certain features that may need verification, but it can also be used when adding Custom Fields and Custom Values in messages, social posts, email campaigns, websites, and even funnels.

To learn more about the Business Profile Settings, including how to navigate to the settings panel, see: [Business Profile Settings Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006223-business-profile-settings/preview#Where-Do-I-Find-the-Business-Profile?)

# **Business Physical Address Settings**

These fields act as the single source of truth for location and locale preferences in HighLevel. Complete each entry carefully, matching official records where noted. After updating, save your changes and spot-check a booking page and a test email/SMS to confirm that dates, times, and formatting look correct.

## **Business Physical Address**

The Business Physical Address should **match the address on your EIN listing**. This information may be used to verify your business if needed.

## **Time Zone**

Automated events within campaigns work with this field to determine when to send. You may be able to override this default timezone setting depending on the feature being used, such as workflows or email campaigns. Always check your business profile settings and the settings of the feature being used to make sure the correct time zone is selected.

## **Platform Language**

This setting controls what language your sub-account displays in. Meaning, if you speak and read English, you would want your HighLevel sub-account to be displayed in English. If you speak and read Spanish, you would most likely want your sub-account to be displayed in Spanish.

You can see in the example below that we changed the "Platform Language" to Spanish, and all of the text in the application is now showing in Spanish

## **Outbound Communication Language for Custom Values**

When you are sending Custom Fields and Custom Values in messages, HighLevel needs to know how you want that information to be displayed to the person or persons receiving the message. Selecting the proper language here will make sure that when you send a message with Custom Fields or Custom Values, or use Custom Fields and Custom Values anywhere else such as in websites and funnels, that the correct language is being displayed.
