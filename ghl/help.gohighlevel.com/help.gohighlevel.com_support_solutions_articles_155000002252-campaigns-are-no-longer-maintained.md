# Campaigns are no longer maintained

Modified on: Fri, 23 May, 2025 at 6:29 AM

Our platform has been evolving rapidly and Workflows is a robust feature designed to enhance your automation experience. As a part of this evolution, we will be sunsetting the Campaigns feature.

**Why the change?** Workflows provide a more powerful and flexible automation solution, simplifying workflow management and maintenance.

**Timeline for Sunsetting Campaigns**

**Step 1 -** User will not be able to create new Campaigns and Triggers from 15th April 2024

**Step 2 -** No support will be available for Campaigns and Triggers from 15th April 2024

**What does this mean for you?**

- **Migration to Workflows:** We encourage you to migrate your existing Campaigns to Workflows for a seamless transition.

```
Please Note: Campaigns and Triggers Tab wont be shown in the CRM now. Please use Workflows for better functionality. Refer to Workflow Builder Walkthrough
```
