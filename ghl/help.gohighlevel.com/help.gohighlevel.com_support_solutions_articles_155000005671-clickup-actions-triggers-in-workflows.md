## 1\. Introduction

The ClickUp integration in HighLevel enables seamless automation between your CRM workflows and ClickUp’s project management platform.

### Why It Matters

With this integration, agencies, marketers, and SMBs can:

- Automatically turn CRM events (like form submissions or appointment outcomes) into ClickUp tasks.

- Keep project management in sync with client interactions.

- Save time by reducing manual task creation and project updates.

1. **Search in Workflows**

   - Open your HighLevel workflow builder and search for any ClickUp actions or triggers you’d like to add.
2. **Connect Your Account**

   - If your ClickUp account is already connected, you’ll see the configuration options right away.

   - If not, click **Connect Now** and complete the integration setup.
3. **Alternative Method**

   - You can also connect from **Settings → Integrations**.

   - Find **ClickUp** in the list of available integrations and complete the authorization process.

Once connected, you’ll be able to seamlessly add ClickUp triggers and actions to your automations.

## 4\. How ClickUp Triggers Work

ClickUp triggers rely on **webhooks** through ClickUp’s API. When a trigger condition is met (like a new task or a status change), HighLevel immediately processes the event and initiates the workflow.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Choose a trigger (e.g., New Task).

2. Name your trigger and click **Test Trigger**.

3. HighLevel will fetch metadata from ClickUp to enable field mapping in your workflow actions.

## 5\. Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Create ClickUp Tasks from HighLevel Form Submissions

**Goal:** Convert HighLevel form submissions into actionable ClickUp tasks.

**Workflow Setup:**

- **Trigger:** Form Submitted

- **Filter:** Form Name = “Client Onboarding Form”

- **Actions:** Create Task (ClickUp), Add Task Comment (ClickUp)


**Example:**

A client submits the onboarding form with their requirement details → A task is created in the “Client Setup” list in ClickUp → A comment is added with the client’s expectations.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052402986/original/E4p7Hl7VD6cOsKB7GsViphdXRj0ObqsxgA.png?1756216324)

* * *

### Use Case 2: Auto-Generate AI-Powered Proposal Documents

**Goal:** Automatically generate personalized proposals, briefs, or summaries when an opportunity changes stage, using AI to draft content and ClickUp to store the document.

**Workflow Setup:**

- **Trigger:** Opportunity Status Changed

- **Filter:** Stage = “Proposal request” (or any relevant pipeline stage)

- **Actions:**

1. **GPT powered by OpenAI** → Generate proposal content (e.g., client-specific summary, deliverables, pricing outline).

2. **Create New Document (ClickUp)** → Save the AI-generated proposal in ClickUp under the “Sales Docs” folder.

**Example:**

A deal advances to the “Proposal Sent” stage → GPT generates a tailored proposal titled _“Proposal for {{contact.name}}”_ with scope, deliverables, and pricing → A new ClickUp document is automatically created and shared with the sales team for review.

* * *

### Use Case 3: Auto-Build Project Spaces Based on Opportunity Type

**Goal:** Automatically set up structured project workspaces in ClickUp whenever a deal moves to a new stage, with tasks and notifications tailored to the service type (Landing Page, SEO, or Google Ads).

**Workflow Setup:**

- **Trigger:** Pipeline Stage Changed

- **Action:** Create Space in ClickUp (named after the client/opportunity)

- **Condition Branching:**

  - **Landing Page Branch** → If Opportunity Name = “Landing Page”

    - Create List: _Landing Page Project_

    - Create Task: “Design Landing Page”

    - Internal Notification to assigned team
  - **SEO Branch** → If Opportunity Name = “SEO”

    - Create List: _SEO Setup_

    - Create Task: “Keyword Research & Site Audit”

    - Internal Notification to SEO team
  - **Google Ads Branch** → If Opportunity Name = “Google\_Ads”

    - Create List: _Google Ads Campaign_

    - Create Task: “Campaign Setup & Tracking”

    - Internal Notification to Ads team
  - **None Branch** → Ends workflow if conditions are not met

**Example:**

A deal moves to the “Contract Signed” stage. If the opportunity is for SEO, a new ClickUp space named _“\[Client Name\] - SEO Project”_ is created. Inside it, an _SEO Setup_ list is generated with a first task: _Keyword Research & Site Audit_. An internal notification is sent to the SEO manager, ensuring immediate project kickoff.
