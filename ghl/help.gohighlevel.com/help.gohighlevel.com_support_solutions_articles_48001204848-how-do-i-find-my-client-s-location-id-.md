# How do I find my Client's Location ID?

Modified on: Tue, 5 Aug, 2025 at 4:56 PM

When you interact with our support teams, they may request you to provide a location ID where you face a problem. Location ID is a unique ID given to every sub-account in your agency account. This helps us identify your client's account and narrow down out trouble shooting efforts.

To locate the location ID, follow these steps:

1. From the **Sub-Account Dashboard,** go to **S** **ettings** in lower right-hand corner

2. Select **Business Profile** on the left-side navigation bar

3. The **Location ID** will be visible as shown below

```
Important: Please do not share the location ID outside of your organization.
