Modified on: Wed, 4 Jun, 2025 at 5:55 AM

HighLevel Ad Manager allows you to **create, manage, and edit Google Ads offline conversion actions** — directly from within the platform. This ensures that your **offline sales, leads, and actions** are properly tracked in Google Ads for better optimisation and reporting.

In this article, we’ll cover how to use the **Google Ads Conversion Action Flow** inside Ad Manager.

* * *

## **Key Notes & Best Practices**

- This flow is for **Offline Conversion Actions** \- tracking events like leads, sales, and calls that occur **outside** your website/app.
- All conversions created here are automatically available in your Google Ads account and can be used in campaign reporting.
- Existing Google Ads conversions are automatically imported into this view.
- HighLevel’s tracking will **upload conversion events** to match these conversion actions (via workflows - separate from this setup, refer [from step 8 of this help article](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001220947-how-to-set-up-google-ad-conversion-actions#Step-8%3A%C2%A0Now-let) for reference).
- Future enhancements will add **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** integration for **website conversion actions**.
