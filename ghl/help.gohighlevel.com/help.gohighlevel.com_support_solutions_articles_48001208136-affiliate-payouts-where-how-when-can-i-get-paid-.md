![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48184759451/original/1y6rtj2LQTkkek8bpSVaO_6M8DF6TSFVsw.png?1643567205)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48184759992/original/dHq32H2QWDCdQHSrNevFgqWQF8s9JtJvGg.png?1643567258)

If you get an email or an error in your affiliate portal your EIN is invalid.

- 1.) Try to log in to the Tipalti [https://suppliers.tipalti.com/highlevel/Account/Login](https://suppliers.tipalti.com/highlevel/Account/Login) and see if you can update your EIN/tax forms, and revalidate the information you have on file.

- 2.) You can also login into your affiliate portal in your HL account and re-enter your EIN under Payment Details > Tax Forms.

- 3.) If your EIN validation is still failing. Send an email to [affiliatepayments@gohighlevel.com](mailto:affiliatepayments@gohighlevel.com) or make a support ticket and we will be able to look into this for you. Be sure you give us your Affiliate email/Referal link in the ticket.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48184758809/original/_GIYQ_0ZvCFWwUiYpOwwcICQ8ERsiosTzw.png?1643566500)

**Please note:**

```
Create a support ticket through our portal. Be sure to include your affiliate email and your referral link and title the ticket relating to this affiliate portal issue so we can be sure to see this and look into this asap!
```

## **I have had a pending payment that looks to be stuck on my dashboard.**

If you have a payment that looks to be stuck on "pending" it could be that your pending affiliate customer payout is being flagged as a "self-referral"

to Self-referrals flags are auto-generated by FirstPromoter and are usually due to signing up at the same IP address, having the same name & e-mail address, and/or having the same phone number.

We allow consultants/friends to help their clients/friends sign up (sometimes people will sign up next to each other to make sure they click the right link). We do not allow John Doe's Marketing Agency to sign up using John Doe's link (that was an example).

If you do not believe this is the case open a support ticket with us! Be sure to include your affiliate email and your referral link and title the ticket relating to this affiliate portal issue so we can be sure to see this and look into this asap!

For more questions about the affiliate payment policy, please check out our affiliate policy! [gohighlevel.com/affiliate-policy](https://www.gohighlevel.com/affiliate-policy)

* * *

## **Certificate of No US Activities**

In rare cases, your payments may be affected due to a Certificate of No US Activities. In this instance, you should have received a relevant email titled "Certificate of No US Activities - Unpayable Affiliates" from the HighLevel team.

To resolve this, please log into your HighLevel account, and click on the Affiliate Portal to access your dashboard. You may need to update your information within the portal.

If you do not have a HighLevel account, please log into Tipalti and navigate to the tax form page to update your information.
