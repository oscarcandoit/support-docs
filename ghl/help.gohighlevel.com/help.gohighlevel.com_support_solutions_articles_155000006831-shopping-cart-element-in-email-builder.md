## **What is the Shopping Cart Element in Email Builder?**

The Shopping Cart Element is a drag-and-drop block that enables you to add product details and checkout links inside your email. It’s typically used for **abandoned cart reminders**, **product recommendations**, or **limited-time promotions**.

You can customise each item’s image, name, description, price, and button link giving you full control over how your products are presented in the email layout.

> **Note:** The Shopping Cart Element doesn’t process payments directly. Instead, it links users to your website or store checkout page for completing purchases.

## **Key Benefits of the Shopping Cart Element**

Using the Shopping Cart Element in your email design offers several benefits:

- Showcase product details and pricing in a clean, structured layout.

- Add “Buy Now” or “Return to Cart” buttons with direct checkout links.

- Drive conversions through visually optimized cart reminders.

- Easily customise colours, spacing, and fonts for on-brand presentation.

- Fully responsive displays beautifully on both desktop and mobile.
