# Custom Conversation Providers in Mobile App

Modified on: Fri, 15 Nov, 2024 at 2:22 PM

The mobile app conversations tab supports communication with customers on custom channels that can be integrated from the App Marketplace. You can have conversations with your leads and customers across any channel that they prefer by using your mobile app, resulting in faster reply times and more deals closed!

```
Remember to install your custom conversation provider from the App Marketplace and verify it's active in Settings > Conversation Providers.
```

When we refer to "custom conversation providers", we are referring to additional SMS and Email providers accessible from the App Marketplace in your Agency Account. These are different from "native conversation providers" that are natively supported in HighLevel (ex: WhatsApp is natively supported, you don't have to get it through the Marketplace).

```

# **Where To Find Custom Conversations**

You'll find custom conversation providers in the Conversations tab of the mobile app. You can start a new conversation on any channel, including custom providers, or you can switch to a different channel manually inside an existing conversation.
