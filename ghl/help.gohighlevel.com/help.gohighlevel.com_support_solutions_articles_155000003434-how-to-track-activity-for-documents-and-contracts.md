- [Note:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003434-how-to-track-activity-for-documents-and-contracts#Note%3A)

## **What's new?**

- Send out a document and view its entire history from sent, edited, viewed, to signed - just by clicking on view history on the options menu.
- Hover on the contact icon and view the last viewed time and the actions that need to be done by the user.

## **How to use?**

- Open Documents and Contracts
- Scroll to the dashboard on the line item of the document that you want to know the status of
- Hover on the customer icons
- See the last action time, tags, status of all the users involved in the document
- To view detailed logs, click on 3 dots and click on view history
- View all the actions that happened on the document in the right drawer

## **Why we built it?**

- Will help users to know the actual status of their documents on the go, without opening the document every time.
- Will help them to get the document to a closure with readily available information.

## **Note:**

Last action time in the hover modal would only be available for the documents that are sent now onwards. For older documents the time won't be available.
