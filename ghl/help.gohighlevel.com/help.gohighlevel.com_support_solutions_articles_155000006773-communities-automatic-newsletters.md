# **What is Automatic Newsletters for Communities?**

Community Newsletters are personalized email digests that surface each member’s most relevant threads, top public posts, followed‑creator updates, and upcoming events. Every card links back to the community so members can re‑engage quickly. Owners/Admins enable newsletters at the group level and choose how often they’re sent.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Newsletters for Communities**

- **Build habits**: Regular digests encourage consistent check‑ins and repeat engagement.

- **Re‑engagement**: Lapsed members receive a curated snapshot that draws them back naturally.

- **Automatic growth loop**: Trending posts and can’t‑miss events get more eyes without extra work.

- **Personalization**: Each member sees posts from creators they follow plus their own active threads.

- **Frictionless calls‑to‑action**: Clickable cards deep‑link to the exact post, thread, or event.

- **Permission‑aware**: Content respects a member’s access (public/private channels, groups).

- **Low maintenance**: Set frequency once; newsletters generate and send automatically.


* * *

## **Newsletter Content Rules**

These signals define what members see in their digest so you can set expectations and answer “why did/didn’t this appear?” questions.

- **Active Threads**: Shows the **last thread** a member interacted with, plus the **freshest replies** from others.

- **Top Posts (public channels)**: Highlights trending content so members don’t miss what’s hot.

- **Posts from Followed Members**: Includes updates from creators a member follows.

- **Upcoming Events**: Surfaces the most relevant upcoming events.

- **Clickable Cards**: Each item links back to the originating post, thread, or event for fast re‑engagement.

- **Permissions honored**: Members only see items they’re allowed to access.
