Modified on: Tue, 27 May, 2025 at 7:53 PM

Migrating your WordPress site doesn't have to be intimidating. Think of it like moving to a new house—your valuable content and functionality will all come along smoothly. Let's walk through it together, step-by-step, ensuring nothing gets left behind!

## **LC Migrator - One-Click Migration**

Previously, migrating a WordPress site meant installing third-party plugins like All-in-One Migrator, creating backups, downloading massive files, and then uploading them again to HighLevel. For larger sites, this could take hours—definitely tiring! ?

We’ve completely streamlined your migration experience with our brand-new LC Migrator plugin. Just log in, select your site, click a few buttons, and relax. What used to take hours now takes just a few minutes!

**Key Features**

- **One-Click Migration:** Start the migration directly from the LeadConnector plugin.

- **Zero Downtime:** Your original site stays live while we handle things in the background.

- **Clear Progress Updates:** Stay updated every step of the way, from backup to verification.


### **Step 1: Navigate to Your Site Settings**

First things first, go ahead and click on **Sites > WordPress**. This will get us on the right path to creating your new home for your existing site.

### **Step 2: Activate WordPress**

Look for and click on Activate WordPress. Just like switching on the lights in a new house, we're getting things ready for your arrival.

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Site**

Click on the WordPress site card, select From blank, then choose a template. Select From blank again, click Create, fill out your site's details, and finally hit Create WordPress site. Easy, right?
