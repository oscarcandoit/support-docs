#### **Notice 1: Shutdown of Unregistered 10DLC Messaging**

Starting July 5, 2023, all 10DLC phone numbers used to send SMS and MMS messages to U.S. numbers must be registered to an approved campaign under your brand.

Messages sent from unregistered numbers will face increasing message blocking, leading to a complete block of unregistered U.S.-bound messages after August 31, 2023.

#### **Notice 2: Unregistered 10DLC Message Fee Increases**

AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are raising per-message rates for unregistered traffic.

Unregistered messages may be subject to additional filtering or blocking.

Specific fee increases and timing can be found in the carrier fee section.

To avoid higher fees and service disruptions, register your unregistered traffic for A2P 10DLC via[LC Phone System Trust Center](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001225526).

#### **Notice 3: Sole Proprietor A2P 10DLC Registration - Currently Un-Available**

Sole Proprietor Brand registration has been introduced for sending low-volume messages.

Individuals or small businesses without a Tax ID (EIN) can refer to the FAQ for details on how to register.

Depending on traffic requirements, choose between Low Volume Standard Brands (less than 6,000 messages per day) or Standard Brands (more than 6,000 messages per day) for mixed messaging campaigns.

#### **Notice 4: New Requirements for A2P 10DLC Registrations**

Effective January 26, 2023, new A2P Campaign registrations undergo a vetting process with a one-time campaign vetting fee. [A2P 10DLC Campaign Vetting Changes - January 2023](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001229783)

A2P 10DLC refers to a system in the United States that allows businesses to send Application-to-Person (A2P) type messaging via standard 10-digit long code (10DLC) phone numbers. This system is specific to long code messaging toward the United States, and does not affect shortcodes or Toll-Free numbers sending to the US.
