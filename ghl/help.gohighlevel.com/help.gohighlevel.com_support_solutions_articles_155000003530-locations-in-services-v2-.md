## What is a Location?

A **location** is the place where your service takes place — essentially, the meeting point between you and your customer. This could be your office, a store, or any physical address.

When you first set up your account, a **default location** is automatically created using the business address entered in **Settings > Business Profile**.

- This is ideal for businesses operating from a single location.

- You can update these details anytime in **Calendar Settings > Services > Locations tab** by clicking **Edit** and making the necessary changes.

## Managing Multiple Locations

If your business operates from more than one physical location, you can activate the **Multiple Locations** option. This feature is designed for businesses with multiple branches or offices.

To enable this:

1. Go to **Calendar Settings > Services**.

2. Under **Global Settings**, toggle on **Enable Multiple Locations**.

3. Once activated, you can add more locations under the **Locations tab**.

## How to Add New Locations

After enabling multiple locations, you can add new ones by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Locations tab**.

2. Click **Add New**.

3. Upload a location image (this will appear on the booking page).

4. Enter the location name, phone number, and address.

5. Click **Save Location**.


**Note:** Online locations (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet) are not yet directly supported. As a workaround, you can generate a static video conferencing link and enter it in the **Address** field.

## Setting Staff Availability for Locations

Once locations are created, you need to configure **staff availability** so that services are properly assigned to the correct locations.

To set this up:

1. Go to **Calendar Settings > Services >** **Staff > Edit a staff member**.

2. Navigate to the **Assign Services** tab and assign the required services.

3. Then, navigate to the **Weekly Working Hours** tab.

4. Add the staff member’s working hours based on their availability for a particular service at a specific location.


Staff members can be assigned to multiple locations with different schedules, giving flexibility in how services are

offered.

⚠️ **Important:** For locations to appear during the booking process, they must be linked to staff availability in the **Staff Settings**.

## FAQs

**1\. Do I need to create a location if I only operate from one place?**

No. A default location is automatically created using the address in your **Business Profile**. You only need to create new locations if you operate from multiple places.

**2\. Can I edit the default location?**

Yes. Go to **Calendar Settings > Services > Locations tab**, click **Edit**, and update the details.

**3\. Can I use an online location like Zoom or Google Meet?**

Online locations are not directly supported yet. However, you can paste a static video conferencing link (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet) in the **Address** field as a workaround.

**4\. What happens if I don’t assign staff availability to a location?**

If staff availability is not linked to a location, that location will not appear as an option during the booking process.

**5\. Can staff members work in multiple locations?**

Yes. Staff can be assigned to more than one location with different schedules, giving you flexibility across branches.

**6\. Where will customers see the location information?**

Customers will see the selected location details (including the image, name, and address) on the booking page and in their appointment confirmation.

**7\. Can I delete a location?**

Yes, you can delete additional locations created in your account. **However, the default location cannot be deleted**. You can only edit its details if needed.
