## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1\. Can I set different working hours for different AI tasks or roles?**

Yes, you can set different working hours for various functions within your Voice AI system, such as customer support, lead generation, or appointment scheduling. This allows you to customize availability based on the type of interaction.

**2\. What happens if a user tries to interact with the AI outside of the set working hours?**

If a user tries to engage with the AI outside of its defined working hours, the system can be set to respond with a custom message, redirect to an alternative support channel, or simply inform them that the service is unavailable.

**3\. Can I set working hours for specific days of the week?**

Yes, you can define working hours for specific days of the week. For example, you might set your AI to be available 9 AM - 5 PM on weekdays and limited hours on weekends, or even have different hours on holidays.

**4\. Will the AI automatically update its availability if my working hours change?**

No, the AI will not automatically update its working hours. You will need to manually update the working hours if your schedule changes. You can do this anytime from the settings.

**5\. Can I use working hours to control when the AI sends notifications or follow-up messages?**

Yes, you can use working hours to control when the AI sends notifications, follow-up messages, or reminders to users, ensuring that these messages are sent only during business hours or when it is appropriate.

**6\. Can the AI handle urgent requests outside of working hours?**

While the AI can handle non-urgent inquiries outside of working hours by sending an automated response, it typically won't be able to process urgent requests unless you set up a specific protocol or override for after-hours situations.

**7\. Can I use different time zones for my AI’s working hours?**

Yes, you can set working hours in different time zones, which is especially helpful if you serve customers in various regions. Just make sure the correct time zone is selected when defining your working hours.
