```
A minimum of 3 characters need to be added in the search box for any search to execute.
```

For Contacts - Contact Name, Phone Number and Email Address are mandatory and cannot be removed from the searchable fields.

For Opportunities - Opportunity Name cannot be removed from the searachable fields.
