# Workflows Pro Plan - New Pricing Tiers

Modified on: Thu, 4 Sep, 2025 at 11:08 AM

The new **volume‑based pricing tiers for Workflows  Premium Actions** give every account—from side‑project creators to enterprise automation teams, a lower entry point and more predictable scaling path. Four flexible tiers replace the single Pro Plan, this ensures that you get the most out of your premium executions with the best pricing in the industry. This article explains the tiers, how executions and overages work, and how to purchase a plan.

# **What Is the Workflow Pro Plan?**

The Workflow Pro Plan is an add‑on subscription specifically for managing premium workflow triggers and actions. It sits alongside your main GoHighLevel plan (such as Agency Pro or Agency Unlimited) and handles only the extra‑cost executions. With Workflow Pro, agencies can bulk‑purchase premium triggers and actions at a discounted rate, then resell or allocate those executions to their sub‑accounts. This separation ensures that your core platform features (CRM, website builders, base automation workflows) remain on your primary plan, while all premium workflow costs are consolidated and controlled through the Pro add‑on.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Workflow Pro Plan**

- **Scale-friendly savings:** Pick a tier that fits your volume; higher tiers include more executions and **lower overage rates**

- **Simple resale/markup workflows:** If your account supports rebilling, you can pass through or mark up Premium Action usage to sub-accounts while keeping a single source of truth for usage.

- **Predictable baseline + flexible overage:** A flat monthly fee covers your included executions, and transparent overages apply automatically if you go beyond the bundle.

- **Consolidated billing:** All Premium Triggers/Actions, Marketplace Apps, and LC Apps are billed together, separate from your core subscription.


* * *

## **What are the New Pricing Tiers?**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Included Executions / mo | Overage Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Free** | $0 | **100 free lifetime executions** | **$0.01** / execution |
| **Starter** | **$10 / mo** | **10,000** | **$0.008** / execution |
| **Growth** | **$25 / mo** | **30,000** | **$0.006** / execution |
| **Scale** | **$50 / mo** | **65,000** | **$0.004** / execution |

* * *

## **How Executions & Overages Work**

- An **execution** is a premium action run. This includes executions from Premium Triggers/Actions, Marketplace apps, and LC Apps. Standard (non‑premium) and external AI model workflow steps do **not** count toward your monthly execution allowance.

- Each month, your included executions **reset according to your billing cycle**.

- If you exceed your monthly included executions, additional usage is billed at your tier’s **overage rate**.

- If you’re on the **Free** plan (no subscription), once the **100 lifetime executions** are used, further usage is billed **$0.01 per execution** each month, or you can upgrade to a tier at any time.


* * *

## **Plan Details**

- **Subscription Plan:** Agencies can purchase plan tiers which gives them a set of monthly premium executions.

- **Validity & resets:** Executions **reset at the time of payment**. Upgrading mid-cycle carries your unused executions forward until the next billing cycle.

- **Scope of usage:** Applies to **Premium Triggers**, **Premium Actions**, **Marketplace Apps**, and **LC Apps** used within workflows.

- **No rollover:** Unused executions **do not** carry over. Only mid-cycle plan changes carry forward executions until the next billing cycle.

- **Overages:** Once you reach the included amount, executions **continue** and are billed at the plan’s overage rate.

- **No plan required:** If you don’t subscribe, you can still run Premium Actions at **$0.01/execution** after the 100 free lifetime executions (per sub-account).

- **Counting unit:** Free lifetime executions are **per sub-account**.

## **What changes for you?**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What pricing tiers are available for Workflows Premium Actions?** Free, Starter, Growth, and Scale, each with its own execution bundle and overage rate.

**Q: What counts as an execution—and which executions count toward my limit?** An execution is a premium action run (from Premium Triggers/Actions, Marketplace apps, or LC Apps). Standard workflow actions and external AI model executions do not count toward the monthly limit.

**Q: Is the execution allowance per account or per sub-account?** Per sub-account.

**Q: When do executions reset?** They reset with your billing cycle. If you change plans mid-cycle, remaining executions carry over to the end of the next billing cycle.

**Q: What happens if a workflow hits the limit mid-run?** Workflows continue processing; overage charges apply according to your tier.

**Q: Do existing Workflow Pro plan users need to do anything?** No. Current Pro users are automatically moved to the Starter tier ($10/month).

**Q: Who can see the new pricing tiers at launch?** Initially, only agency admins can view them for centralized billing control.

**Q: Are reselling and rebilling supported on these tiers?** Yes—reselling and rebilling are available on all tiers.
