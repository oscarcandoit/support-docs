# **What Are Campaign Use Case Types?**

Campaign use case types represent the specific purpose of your SMS or MMS messages. When registering a campaign, you're required to select a use case that accurately describes the nature of your communication—such as customer care, two-factor authentication, or marketing. Choosing the correct campaign type is essential to meet industry compliance standards, avoid filtering or blocking, and maintain trust with carriers and recipients.

## **Key Benefits of Choosing the Right Use Case**

Selecting the right campaign use case helps ensure that your messages are delivered reliably, compliantly, and with minimal delays in the application process.

- Reduces the risk of campaign rejection by The Campaign Registry (TCR)

- Helps carriers understand message intent and enforce spam filtering

- Aligns your messaging practices with industry and legal standards

- Supports faster approval and fewer compliance flags

- Improves long-term deliverability and reputation

## **List of Approved Campaign Use Case Types**

Below is a table of commonly accepted campaign use case types as defined by The Campaign Registry. Choose the one that best fits your messaging intent when registering your campaign in HighLevel.

### **Table 1: List of standard campaign use cases**

| **Use Case Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2FA | Two-factor authentication messages for login or identity verification. | "Your code is 654321." |
| Account Notifications | Updates about account status, changes, or activity. | "Your billing info was updated." |
| Customer Care | Support or service messages initiated by the customer. | "We’ve received your request. Here’s the update..." |
| Delivery Notifications | Shipping or fulfillment alerts for goods or services. | "Your package has been delivered." |
| Fraud Alert Messaging | Alerts about suspicious or unauthorized account activity. | "Did you attempt a $500 withdrawal?" |
| Higher Education | Communications from colleges or universities. | "Class registration is now open." |
| Marketing | Promotional content and sales offers. | "Save 25% with code SPRING25!" |
| Mixed | Combines multiple use cases like marketing + notifications. | Promo + appointment reminder messages. |
| Polling and Voting | Non-political surveys or voting messages. | "What feature should we add next?" |
| Public Service Announcement | Non-commercial, awareness-based messaging. | "Flu shots are now available at the clinic." |
| Security Alerts | Notifications about potential system or physical security risks. | "Unauthorized login attempt detected." |

### **Special Campaign Use Cases**

Certain campaigns are categorized as "special" by carriers and require additional documentation, verification, or pre-qualification. These often involve sensitive or regulated communications. Special use cases may involve different fees, verification requirements, and carrier-specific restrictions.

- **Charity / 501(c)(3) Nonprofit**: For registered nonprofit organizations conducting charitable outreach. Must provide IRS nonprofit verification.

- **Emergency Services**: Used by government agencies to deliver urgent safety or emergency messages. Strictly limited and regulated.

- **Political**: For political messaging, including campaigns, parties, and PACs. Requires verification through Campaign Verify.


### **Low-Volume Use Cases**

In addition to the standard “Mixed” or “Marketing” campaign types, there is a dedicated use case called Low Volume Mixed. This option is intended for businesses with lighter SMS needs. It supports the same range of message types as a standard Mixed campaign—such as marketing, customer care, and notifications—but comes with a lower monthly fee. Unlike other campaign types, Low Volume Mixed is locked to the lowest available throughput tier, regardless of the brand’s Trust Score. This makes it an ideal, cost-effective choice for small businesses or organizations that don’t require high-volume messaging.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I choose the wrong campaign use case?**

Choosing the wrong use case can lead to campaign rejection, delivery filtering, or compliance issues. Always select the use case that best matches the primary intent of your messages.

**Q: Can I register more than one campaign use case?**

Yes. If your business sends different types of messages (e.g., marketing and customer support), you may need to register multiple campaigns, each with its appropriate use case.

**Q: Can I switch my campaign use case after it’s approved?**

No. To change your use case, you'll need to register a **new campaign** with the updated details and sample messages.
