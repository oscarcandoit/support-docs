### ``` Tip: For calculating segments and understanding more about how to calculate the per SMS and MMS cost, refer to How to Calculate SMS and MMS Costs ```

### **4\. Voice Calls**

The cost of voice calls depends on **call duration (per minute)**. Below is a detailed breakdown for **US and Canada**.

## **_Outbound Calls_**

**Total Cost:** **$0.0166 per minute**

**Breakdown:**

- **Outbound USA:** $0.0126/min

_(includes 10% discount on list price of $0.014)_

- **Client Minutes:** $0.004/min


## **_Inbound Calls_**

Inbound calls generally consist of **two legs**:

1. **Incoming call** to your HighLevel number (from the caller)

2. **Forwarded call** to wherever you answer it , e.g., web, mobile, desk phone, or another number


Charges apply for **both legs**, depending on where you answer.

### **If Answered on** _**Web, Mobile, or Deskphone**_  **Total Cost:** **$0.01165 per minute**

**Breakdown:**

- **Incoming Call (USA):** $0.00765/min

_(includes 10% discount on list price of $0.0085)_

- **Client Minutes:** $0.004/min


**Note:** Voice AI calls may add **$0.004/min** if the provider uses SIP infrastructure.

### **If Answered on a USA Forwarding Number**

**Total Cost:** **$0.02 per minute**

**Breakdown:**

- **Incoming Call (USA):** $0.00765/min

- **Outgoing Call (to your forwarding number):** $0.0126/min


**Explanation** **:**

If you forward your HighLevel number to a US phone number or any other phone number you’ll pay for both the **incoming** and **outgoing** portions of the call.

> Note- The above example illustrates pricing for a **US LC number**. Actual rates vary by country based on Twilio’s pricing

### **Important Notes**

- **International Forwarding:**

If you forward incomming call to an international number (e.g., UK mobile), the second leg follows **Twilio’s international rates**, which are higher.

[View Twilio’s Local, Mobile, and Toll-Free International Rates](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/voice/pricing/us)

- **Regional Exceptions:**

Calls to **Alaska** and **Yukon Territory** follow **Twilio’s regional pricing** and are **not billed** at the standard US/Canada rates.

- **Other Countries:**

For all other regions, pricing is based on **Twilio’s international call rates**.

- **Billing Rounding:**

Calls are billed in **full minutes**.

Any partial minute is **rounded up** to the next whole minute.

- **Call Reporting**: Reports display the exact call duration, even if billing rounds up.

- ```
Example:
```







| ```<br>Type<br>``` | ```<br>Number of Calls<br>``` | ```<br>Actual Duration in call reports<br>``` | ```<br>Billed Duration<br>``` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ```<br>Example<br>``` | ```<br>2 calls<br>``` | ```<br>45 seconds each (1m 30s total)<br>``` | ```<br>2 minutes total<br>``` |






> ```
> Summary:
> Call reporting shows precise durations for transparency, while billing uses the rounded-up minute for calculation.
> ```


```
Please Note: The outbound calls have 2 legs so the cost of an outbound call will be $0.0180 ($0.014 for Outbound call + $0.004 for the webApp/MobileApp leg which dialer uses to initiate the call (Client Minutes))
```

### **5\. Number Intelligence**

Number Intelligence is a bundle of three functions. All three are turned on/off together, refer to [Number Intelligence - Number Validation, Spam Detection, and Unknown Caller](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001153968-number-intelligence-number-validation-spam-detection-and-unknown-caller)

- **Number Validation** ($0.005/call): before sending an SMS, check if the number is valid, if invalid do not send the SMS.

- **Spam Detection** ($0.005/test): when receiving an incoming US call, test it for spam, mark is "spam likely" if it fails the test.

- **Name Lookup** ($0.01/lookup): when receiving an incoming US call, if the number is not on a contact or the contact name is empty, look up the caller's name.

```

```

Here’s how A2P Brand and Campaign registration fees apply for both Low Volume and High Volume campaigns:

| **Type** | **One-Time Brand & Campaign Registration Fee** | **Monthly Campaign Fee** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

> **Important:**
>
> - **Monthly campaign fees are determined by The Campaign Registry (TCR) and may still apply even if a campaign fails, is rejected, or requires resubmission.**

**Q: Why am I being charged for incoming SMS?** LC Phone charges for both inbound and outbound SMS at the same rate

**Q.** **Will SaaS re-billing work if I move sub-accounts on LC Phone System?**

**Q.Will I be charged if I encounter an error when sending an SMS?**

If there's an internal error with LC Phone before the message is handed off to the phone provider, you won't be charged. However, charges apply to every message where a delivery attempt has been made, regardless of the final delivery status. This includes messages sent from toll-free numbers, A2P numbers, and those not deliverable due to country restrictions or other factors. We urge users to be fully informed and cautious before sending messages, as refunds will not be provided for undelivered SMS.

**Q. Why am I getting charged for Call Recording Storage even though I didn't record calls recently?**

Any Call Recording stored incurs storage charges. This means older call recordings also incur these storage charges. If you want to avoid these charges:

- Retain recent call recordings and delete older ones using the feature "Automatically Delete Older Recordings" under Sub-account settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > Voice Calls > Call Recording

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052319944/original/6bu5Rpi3Tvbe1A7uJHPFW4AwnlFO_mRSXQ.png?1756137193)
- Delete all call recordings to avoid all storage charges. Set the time period in the above feature to 1 day and disable call recording for future calls

**Q. Why do I pay for Conference Call charges for all outgoing calls (even the ones without call transfer)?**

Our outgoing call flow is optimised to be seamless, with lower waiting times and quicker transfers. Thus, we initiate a Conference Call for all outgoing calls as per our standard call flow implementation.
