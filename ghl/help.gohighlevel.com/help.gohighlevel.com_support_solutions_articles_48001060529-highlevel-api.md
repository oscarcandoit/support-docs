Modified on: Fri, 31 Oct, 2025 at 12:42 AM

```
Please Note: V1 APIs has reached end-of-support.

Existing connections/integrations will continue to work, however no support will be provided for V1 APIs.

Check out - Private Integrations
```

```
Please Note: Going forward, the ability to generate new API keys will be removed from both Agency and Sub-account settings.This change applies to accounts that have not yet generated or are not currently using a API key.
```

## **How to Get Help or Support for the HighLevel API**

```
At this time, HighLevel Support does NOT provide setup code auditing or developer consultative services on API-Related topics. However, if your setup is complete and correct - yet an error persists, you may have encountered an API Bug we need to fix.

You can report this bug by filling out this form: https://developers.gohighlevel.com/support
```

- **For any questions relating to the HighLevel API, join the developer Slack group to ask our community of talented customers here: [https://developers.gohighlevel.com/join-dev-community](https://developers.gohighlevel.com/join-dev-community)**

- **HighLevel Devs host a monthly a Developer Council Call on the second to last Friday, which you can find on the events calendar here: [https://www.gohighlevel.com/events](https://www.gohighlevel.com/events)**

## **How to Submit a New API-Related Idea to HighLevel**

```
Our API Docs list all available endpoints that are publicly available. If you don’t see an endpoint on either of the API developer sites listed below, we recommend visiting our GitHub Issues page to submit your request.
```

## **Differences Between API Access Across Plan Levels**

**Basic API access is included with our Starter and Unlimited plans, while Advanced API access is available on our Agency Pro plan.**

**In addition to the future endpoints that will be released in our OAuth 2.0 API (which is only available in our Advanced API access), this tier unlocks the use of Agency API Keys where lower plan levels only access Location API Keys.**

## **What are the Rate Limits for API 1.0 & API 2.0?**

**GHL has implemented rate limits on our public V2 APIs using OAuth to ensure optimal performance and stability. These limits have been adjusted to:**

**Burst limit: A maximum of 100 API requests per 10 seconds for each Marketplace app (i.e., client) per resource (i.e., Location or Company).**

**Daily limit: 200,000 API requests per day for each Marketplace app (i.e., client) per resource (i.e., Location or Company).**

**These new limits contribute to better overall performance and stability of our system.**

**To monitor your limited usage, refer to the following API response headers:**

**'X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily': Your daily limit**

**'X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining': The remaining number of requests for the day**

**'X-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds': The time interval for burst requests**

**'X-RateLimit-Max': The maximum request limit in the specified time interval**

**'X-RateLimit-Remaining': The remaining number of requests in the current time interval**
