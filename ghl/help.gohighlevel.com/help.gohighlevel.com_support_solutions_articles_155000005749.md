## **Advanced Filtering in the Sub-Accounts List**

The **new Sub-Accounts List UI** in HighLevel now includes an **Advanced Filter** option, available to agency users on the **$97 and $297 plans**. These filters help you quickly find sub-accounts based on specific platform features, configurations, or status.

### **Step 1:** Add a Basic Filter

1. Click on the **Filter(Funnel)** button at the top of the Sub-Accounts List.

2. The **Advanced Filters panel** will slide open, displaying four filter categories:




   - **General** (e.g., Date Added, Snapshots)

   - **Reselling** (e.g., Listings, WhatsApp, Email, AI tools)

   - **Rebilling** (e.g., Email/Phone Verification, LC Premium)

   - **LeadConnector** (e.g., LC Email, LC Phone)
3. Click on any **Search** **Filed** of your choice under any of the above four categories.

4. Select the **Conditions** you want to filter by for the particular search filed.

5. Add an **OR Logic filter** by clicking the **\+ Add Filter** button.


```
OR Logic: At least one condition must be true for a result to be shown. Filters are applied so that data matching any one of the conditions is included.

Example: If you filter by (LC Email is Enabled or LC Phone is Enabled), this will return sub-accounts that have either LC Email or LC Phone enabled (or both).
```

### **Step 2:** Add Nested Filters (Optional)

1. Click on the **\+ Add Nested Filter** button.

2. This filter works on the **AND Logic.**


```
And Logic: All conditions must be true for a result to be shown. Filters are combined so that the data must match every specified condition.

Example: If you filter by (Date Added after Jan 1 and LC Email is Enabled), this will only show sub-accounts that were added after Jan 1 and also have LC Email enabled.
```

### **Step 3:** Apply and Review Filter Results

1. Click **Apply** to run the filters.

2. The system will return matching sub-accounts. If no results match, a message will appear:

“No more locations found.”

- Use checkboxes to select individual sub-accounts or click on the **Select** **all** check box.

- Once you have selected desired sub-accounts, click on the **Bulk** **Actions** dropdown.

- You have two bulk actions available: **Pause Sub-Account** and **Enable Rebilling**.
