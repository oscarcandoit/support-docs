# Fill Your Calendar: Guide to Running Ad Campaigns That Actually Book

Modified on: Fri, 25 Apr, 2025 at 3:12 AM

In an industry as competitive and aesthetic-forward as medical aesthetics, running ads isn’t optional—it’s essential. But here’s the catch: beautiful imagery and clever copy only go so far if they’re not connected to a smart system that actually converts curiosity into consults.

This guide is for med spa owners and marketers who are tired of boosting posts and crossing their fingers. If you’ve ever asked, “Why aren’t my ads turning into bookings?”—this is for you.

Inside, you’ll learn how to:

- Design high-converting offers tailored for your med spa

- Build lead-gen funnels that move fast and feel seamless

- Retarget browsers who didn’t book (yet!)

- Track what’s working so you can scale what’s smart

- Use GoHighLevel to run the entire system without lifting a finger


Let’s break it down and build your next campaign the right way—from impression to injection.

## **Step-by-Step: How to Run Med Spa Ad Campaigns That Convert**

### **Step 1: Craft a Scroll-Stopping Offer**

Before you think about targeting or ad copy, focus on this: **what’s your offer?**

Your audience sees hundreds of beauty ads a day. Your offer needs to be both clear and compelling.

Proven med spa offers:

- “HydraFacial Glow Pass – 3 Sessions for $249 (Save $150)”

- “Free Skin Analysis + $50 Treatment Credit”


Your offer should:

- Be time-sensitive (“This week only”)

- Have a clear CTA (“Book now” or “Claim your spot”)

- Be presented with visuals that match your clinic’s vibe


* * *

### **Step 2: Build a Lead Funnel (Ad → Form → Booking)**

Using GoHighLevel, build a lead capture funnel that connects your ad to your calendar:

1. **Landing Page**

   - Highlights the offer

   - Includes before/after photos

   - Features 1–2 client reviews

   - Has a lead capture form (name, email, phone, service interest)
2. **Thank You Page**

   - Repeats the offer and adds urgency

   - Embeds your GoHighLevel booking calendar

   - Prompts them to book immediately or “skip the line”
3. **Follow-Up Sequence**

   - SMS & Email reminder with booking link

   - Optional: Include FAQs or a “What to expect” mini-guide

### **Step 3: Automate the Follow-Up (Don’t Ghost Your Leads)**

Every ad campaign should connect directly to a smart follow-up flow:

- Instant text: “Hey \[Name\], got your request for the Glow Package! Book your spot here.”

- 4-hour check-in: “Still thinking about it? We only have 2 openings left this week.”

- 24-hour reminder: “Your glow-up can’t wait. Last call to claim your facial package.”


This keeps the lead warm—and booked.

### **Step 4: Retarget Leads Who Didn’t Book (Yet)**

Use Facebook or Instagram retargeting ads to stay top of mind.

Ad ideas:

- A carousel of transformation stories (before/afters)

- A client video testimonial: “Why I chose \[Your Spa\]”

- A “Still Interested?” message with the original offer


Bonus: You can upload unbooked leads from GoHighLevel into Facebook Custom Audiences to retarget automatically.

* * *

### **Step 5: Track & Optimize Your Results**

Inside GoHighLevel, monitor key ad funnel metrics:

- **Cost per lead (CPL)**

- **Lead-to-booking conversion rate**

- **Top-performing offers by service**

- **Which follow-ups lead to most bookings**


This lets you make smart decisions: scale what’s working, tweak what’s not, and pause campaigns that don’t convert.
