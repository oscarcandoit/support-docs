## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I enable both card payments and bank transfers on the same invoice?**

Yes and no. You would need to enable **"All Valid Payment Methods"**, which would enable more than just card payments and bank transfers. This specific feature is designed to make bank transfers the exclusive payment option for an invoice.

**Q: Does this feature require Stripe integration?**

Yes, enabling bank transfers involves configuring your Stripe account to handle these payments. To learn more about setting up bank transfer capabilities, check out this help article: [ACH Debit Payment Method on Invoices](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000611)

**Q: Is this feature available for all HighLevel plans?**

Yes, as long as invoicing is included in your plan.

**Q: How do I track payments made via bank-only transfers?**

Payments are recorded under the **Invoices** section, similar to other payment methods.
