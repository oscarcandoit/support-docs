### **Auto-deletion of API keys after 90 days of inactivity**

- Agency or sub-account API keys that have not been used in the past 90 days will be automatically deleted.
- **Deletion cadence**: This activity will be once a quarter (automated) across all agency and sub-account API keys.
- **Customer communication**:
  - The impacted Agency and Sub-accounts admins will receive three in-app notifications giving them a heads-up - 15 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the deletion
  - Agency admins (included those whose locations are impacted) will receive an email 15 days prior with a complete summary of the upcoming deletion
  - One day before the deletion, for 24 hours, the impacted agencies and sub-accounts will see a banner informing them about the upcoming deletion.
