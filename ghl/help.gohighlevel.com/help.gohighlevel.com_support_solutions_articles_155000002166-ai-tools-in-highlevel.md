## **What is AI?**

AI, short for Artificial Intelligence, simulates human intelligence in machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. In the context of business, AI offers automation and enhancement of processes, creative assistance, and improved customer experiences.

* * *

## **How AI Works**

AI operates on prompts provided by users. A prompt is the directive or content given to the AI, which then generates a response based on the input. Detailed prompts lead to more accurate and relevant AI responses.

## **Should I Use Conversation AI or Workflow AI?**

| --- | --- |
| **Conversation AI** | **Workflow AI** |
| - Recommended for most users due to its training and user-friendly interface.<br>  <br>- Easier to learn and use.<br>- Great for general requests based on trained content.<br>- Most closely answers from trained material and prompts only - not considering outside sources that are not trained. | - Greater control over prompting.
