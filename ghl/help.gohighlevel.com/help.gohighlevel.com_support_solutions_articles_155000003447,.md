### **Advanced Filters for Appointments**

We’ve introduced advanced filtering options to make it easier to navigate and manage your appointments. These filters allow you to quickly pinpoint specific appointments based on various attributes:

1. **Calendar**: Narrow your search by selecting specific calendars. This is useful if you manage multiple calendars for different teams, departments, or purposes.

2. **Users**: Filter appointments by the users assigned to them. This helps you view all appointments associated with specific staff members or users, ensuring clear oversight of team activities.

3. **Status**: Track appointment progress with status filters, which include:

   - **New**: Appointments that have just been created.
   - **Confirmed**: Appointments that have been confirmed by you.
   - **Showed**: Contacts who attended the scheduled appointment.
   - **No-show**: Contacts who missed their appointment.
   - **Cancelled**: Appointments that were cancelled.
   - **Invalid**: Appointments that were marked as invalid for various reasons.
4. **Date Added**: Filter by the date the appointment was originally created. This is helpful for finding recent bookings or tracking the influx of appointments over time.

5. **Start Date / Appointment Time**: Use this filter to sort appointments by their scheduled start date and time. This is essential for tracking upcoming or past appointments within a specific time frame.

6. **Created By**: Use this filter to find appointments based on who created them.

7. **Is Rescheduled**: View appointments that have been rescheduled, allowing you to track changes and follow up as needed.


You can use **AND** and **OR** filters to tailor your filtering options according to your specific use case. Additionally, when selecting a calendar, user, or status, you have the flexibility to use the following conditions: **is** or **is any of.** This allows you to choose either a single item or multiple items based on your requirements.
