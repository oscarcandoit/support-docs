### Overview

You can now send invoices to your customers/clients using the **Products** you have created in your sub-account or by simply typing things within the invoice. There are two types of invoices available

1. Invoices &
2. Recurring invoices ([How to Edit Recurring Invoices](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004403))

If you are using invoicing without Stripe Connect, please see this guide : Using invoices for recording manual payments without Stripe Connect. The limitation is that you will need to manually record the payments.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)

## Q: Why is my logo missing on older invoices, but shows up on new ones?

Your logo is missing because the original image file was deleted from your Media Library.

Invoices pull the logo from its original file location. If you delete that file, the link breaks for all existing invoices.

How to Fix It:

- For New Invoices: The system is fine; it's using the current logo from your settings.

- For Unpaid Invoices: Upload a new logo to your Media Library and make sure your Business Details are updated with this new image. The logo will reappear on these.

- For Paid Invoices: The logo cannot be fixed because paid records cannot be edited. You would have to manually add the logo to the PDF if you need to resend a receipt.


Reference: [Business Profile Settings - General Information](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006181-business-profile-settings-general-information#Business-Logo)

Q: I'm unable to enter text for my Terms & Conditions or notes in the invoice editor; only the formatting toolbar (Bold, Italic, etc.) is displayed. How do I fix it?

This issue is a local browser error that happens when the text editor fails to load correctly, usually due to a conflict with old data (cache and cookies) stored in your web browser.

To fix the missing text box:

1. Fully clear the cache and cookies in your web browser.

2. Close all tabs, then log back into your HighLevel account.

3. The text editor should now load correctly, allowing you to input your terms and conditions.


Q: Where to find the latest invoice linked to my account?

All invoices can be located under Payments in the Billing Dashboard from the agency view.

Q: My invoice says "Sent," but the client or agent never got it. What's wrong and how do I fix it?

Issues with email sending often stem from browser-related problems rather than system malfunctions. Specifically, outdated cached data and cookies in your web browser can create errors, leading to a false indication that an email has been sent.

To resolve this:

1. Instruct the team member to clear their browser's cache and cookies.

2. Have them log out and then log back into their account.

3. Attempt to resend the estimate.


If the problem persists, please contact support, as it may indicate a more significant issue with your email sending domain.

Q: I sent an invoice, but my client says the link is broken or they can't click it to pay. What happened and how do I fix it?

The payment link is disabled because the invoice is past its scheduled due date. The system automatically deactivates the payment option when the payment date has already passed.

To fix it:

1. you must send a new invoice with a corrected schedule:

2. Duplicate (Clone) the original invoice.

3. Adjust the Payment Schedule dates to a current or future date.

4. Resend the new invoice to your client. The link will then be active.
