# **Overview of Reselling Listings**

Reselling Listings allows HighLevel agencies to offer directory listing management to their clients via a subscription model. Listings syncs your clients’ business info to 70+ online directories to improve local SEO. Agencies can choose from three different pricing plans to resell and customize the pricing to generate monthly recurring revenue:

- Monthly Plan

- Smart Saver Plan (6 months)

- Annual Advantage Plan (12 months)


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Reselling Listings**

Listings reselling helps you offer more value to clients while generating recurring revenue:

- **Flexible Pricing:** Set your own resale rates for each plan

- **Plan Variety:** Offer monthly, 6-month, or annual terms to match client needs

- **Recurring Revenue:** Generate additional streams of recurring revenue

- **Sub-Account Control:** Customize pricing per location

- **Client-Friendly Activation:** Clients can activate Listings directly from their dashboard


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

#### **Connect your Agency Stripe Account**

Your agency Stripe account will be used to collect subscription payments for Listings from your clients. You can connect your agency Stripe account to your agency by following this help article: [How to connect Stripe to your agency dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001171910-how-to-connect-stripe-to-your-agency-dashboard)
