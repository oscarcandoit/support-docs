# Dashboards: Custom Object Widgets and Insights

Modified on: Thu, 30 Oct, 2025 at 12:04 AM

Unlock deeper reporting by visualizing your Custom Objects directly inside HighLevel dashboards. Custom Object Widgets turn your unique data—pets, properties, cases, projects and more into real‑time charts that anyone on your team can explore. Build KPIs that standard CRM objects can’t cover, style them to your brand, and share insights securely across your organization.

# **What is a Custom Object Widget?**

Custom Object Widgets let you add charts that reference the Custom Objects you create in Sub‑Account Settings. Because every business tracks unique data, these widgets transform non‑standard records (for example, “Pets,” “Properties,” “Cases”) into totals and averages you can filter, style, and reuse across dashboards.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Custom Object Widgets**

Custom Object Widgets are designed to surface the KPIs that matter most to your business, even when your data lives outside standard CRM objects.

- **Tailored analytics:** Build metrics for the unique records you track (for example, Avg. Pet Age).

- **Centralized reporting:** Mix Contact, Opportunity, and Custom Object metrics on the same dashboard.

- **Flexible charting:** Switch among Numeric, Line, Bar, Horizontal Bar, Donut, or Table to fit your story.

- **Reusable filters:** Apply dashboard Quick Filters or widget-level filters without changing the original widget view.

- **Secure sharing:** Respect existing dashboard permission tiers so only the right users can view or edit widgets.


* * *

## **Metrics & Chart Types**

Understanding what you can measure and how you can visualize it helps you choose the right chart for the question at hand.

- **Metrics available for Custom Object Widgets:** Count, Sum, Average.

- **Supported chart types (dashboard taxonomy):** Numeric, Table, Bar, Horizontal Bar, Line, Donut.

- A recommended chart type is pre-selected when you add a widget, and you can change it at any time from the chart picker.

- Tables can display multiple fields as columns; charts can use eligible fields for grouping where supported.


* * *

## **Permissions & Sharing**

Govern who can view, filter, or edit widgets using the same permission tiers that control your dashboards.

- Dashboard **VIEW/EDIT/FULL/NO ACCESS** roles continue to apply to Custom Object Widgets.

- Editors can change chart type, metrics, filters, and theme; viewers can interact with Quick Filters.

- Use the three‑dot menu on a widget to **Duplicate** or further configure it without affecting the original.

## **How To Set Up Custom Object Widgets**

Getting set up is fast once your Custom Object exists. Proper setup ensures your fields are available for metrics, grouping, and filters, so your widgets answer the right questions the first time.

Before adding any widgets, **make sure your Custom Object is created**. For step‑by‑step instructions, see **[Creating and Editing Custom Objects](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003897-creating-and-editing-custom-objects)**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How many Custom Objects can I create?**

Up to **three** Custom Objects per location (sub‑account). Each object can be used in widgets.

**Q: Which plans support Custom Objects and dashboards?**

Custom Objects, Dashboards & Custom Reports are Now Available on All Plans

**Q: Can I duplicate a Custom Object Widget?**

Yes. Use the **three‑dot menu → Duplicate** to copy the configuration and tweak as needed.

**Q: Can I group by a picklist field from my Custom Object?**

When a chart or table supports grouping and your object includes eligible select fields, you can group by those fields. Availability varies by chart type.

**Q: Why does my widget show “No data”?**

**A:** Check that your Custom Object has records, that you selected an eligible metric/field, that the date range (if used) includes your data, and that filters or Quick Filters aren’t excluding everything.
