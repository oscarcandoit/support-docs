## **What are Mobile Payments: Create Estimates Using Templates?**

Estimate Templates on mobile let you start a new estimate from a prebuilt template that lives in the HighLevel web app. Your mobile app reads those web templates, so reps can create consistent, error‑free estimates without rebuilding layout, line items, or terms from scratch.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Mobile Payments: Create Estimates Using Templates**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide when to use templates versus creating from scratch in the builder. Templates shine when you need speed, brand consistency, and predictable pricing.

- **Time‑saving:** create new estimates in a few taps using prebuilt templates.

- **Consistency:** keep branding, sections, and pricing formats uniform across reps.

- **Mobility:** generate and send estimates from anywhere while with the client.

- **Seamless access:** templates built on the web are automatically available on mobile.

- **Professionalism:** Reduce manual errors and present polished quotes every time.


* * *

## **Availability & Prerequisites**

A quick readiness check prevents setup issues later. Confirm app versions and where templates are managed so your team can use them on mobile immediately.

- Mobile app version: **HighLevel v3.98.1** or **LeadConnector v3.98.1**.

- Whitelabeled apps: contact your account manager/support to **request the v3.98.1 update**.

- Templates are **created and managed on the web**. Mobile can **use** templates but cannot create/edit/delete them.

- Ensure the user has access/permissions to the sub‑account and Payments > Estimates.


* * *

## **How To Set Up Mobile Payments: Create Estimates Using Templates**

Follow these steps to turn on the feature and create your first estimate from a template. Completing the prerequisites first prevents version‑related issues.

1. Log in to the mobile app and open your preferred subaccount, and head over to the Estimates module from the left-hand navigation bar.

2. You will now see two tabs on the Estimates homepage - Estimates and Templates. Switch to the templates tab.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I create or edit estimate templates from the mobile app?**

No. Templates are created and managed on the **web**. The mobile app lets you use those templates to create new estimates.

**Q: Are my web templates automatically available in the mobile app?**

Yes. Templates created on the web appear under the **Templates** tab in the mobile app.

**Q: What versions support this feature?**

**HighLevel v3.98.1**, **LeadConnector v3.98.1**, and whitelabeled apps after you **request the v3.98.1 update**.

**Q: Can I change line items after choosing a template?**

Yes. You can edit supported fields (like quantities or pricing) on the new estimate before sending.

**Q: The Templates tab isn’t showing—what should I check?**

Confirm the app version is **v3.98.1**, you’re in the correct **sub‑account**, and the user has access to Payments > Estimates. If whitelabeled, verify the v3.98.1 build has been deployed.

**Q: Do template attachments carry over on mobile?**

Attachments follow normal estimate/template rules. See the **Attachments** article linked below for details and limits.

**Q: How do I enable instant payments when the client accepts?**

Use **Direct Payments** for estimates on mobile (link below) so clients can accept and pay in one flow.
