We've introduced **Auto-Save** and an improved **Version History** feature to make the editing experience more reliable and user-friendly across Funnels, Websites, Blogs, Webinars, and E-Commerce. This ensures your changes are saved automatically and that you can easily access previous versions when needed.

## **How Auto-Save Works**

- **Real-Time Auto-Save**

As you make changes, they are automatically saved in real time. There's no need to click “Save” manually.

- **Visual Indicators**

You’ll see indicators such as “Saving…” and “Auto Saved” to confirm that your progress is being saved.

- **Manual Save Still Available**

If you prefer to save manually, the “Save” button remains available for full control.

## **Version History Overview**

Version History allows you to review and restore previous versions of your content. This is useful for undoing changes, reverting to earlier designs, or tracking progress.

### Key Details

- **Time-Stamped Versions**

Each version is labeled with the date and time it was saved for easy reference.

- **Auto-Save Timing**

A new version is saved every 10 minutes, but only if changes were made during that time.

- **Version Limit**

Up to 50 versions (auto and manual combined) are stored for each item. The oldest versions are removed once this limit is reached.

- **Global Section Alert**

When editing a Global Section, a popup will appear to inform you that the changes will apply across all instances where that section is used.
