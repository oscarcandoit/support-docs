# Build a 5-Star Reputation and Bring Back Lapsed Patients — Without Manual Follow-Up, Chiropractors

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 5:31 AM

When people search for a chiropractor near them, reviews and reputation are the deciding factor. And once they’ve seen you? Keeping them engaged and coming back is far easier (and more profitable) than chasing new patients every month.

That’s where this playbook comes in. We’ll show you how to automate your reputation-building, generate more reviews without awkward asks, and re-engage inactive patients using workflows that run on autopilot.

* * *

### **Why Reputation Is Your Clinic’s Most Powerful Marketing Asset**

Before a patient trusts you with their spine, they’re going to Google you. And here’s what they’re looking for:

- Your star rating (4.7 and above builds immediate trust)

- The number of reviews (more = legitimacy)

- How recent the reviews are (stale reviews = stale clinic)

- The tone and response from your team


Even a great website can’t override a weak reputation. But here’s the good news — with the right systems, reviews can come in automatically, without you or your team having to remember to ask.

### **Automate Your Review Collection Process**

#### **Step 1: Choose the Right Timing**

The best time to ask for a review is **right after a positive experience** — often within an hour of their appointment. Use GHL automations to trigger this.

- After an appointment is marked as “completed,” send a thank-you message

- Include a direct Google review link

- Keep it warm, short, and personal


**Example SMS:** "Hi Sarah, thanks for trusting us with your care today at ACME Chiropractic. If you had a great experience, we’d be grateful if you left us a quick review here: \[Link\] — It really helps more people find safe, quality care."

**[How to Send Review Requests](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222668-how-to-send-review-requests)**

* * *

#### **Step 2: Make It Easy to Leave a Review**

- Shorten the Google review link

- Include the link in your appointment confirmation follow-up

- Post a QR code at the front desk or on the checkout counter

- Embed the review button in email footers


**[Displaying the review widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222766-reputation-management-customizing-displaying-the-review-widget)**

* * *

#### **Step 3: Train Staff to Identify Moments Worth Capturing**

You don’t need to ask every patient every time. Just the happy ones. Have front desk staff or providers tag the patient record with “review opportunity” — and let GHL trigger the follow-up.

* * *

#### **Step 4: Respond to Every Review**

Google ranks businesses higher that actively respond to reviews.

**Example Positive Response:** "Thanks, James! We’re thrilled to hear your lower back pain is improving. Can’t wait to see you next week."

**Example for a Negative Review:** "Hi Mark, we’re sorry your experience wasn’t what you expected. We’d love a chance to make it right — feel free to call our clinic directly so we can follow up."

**[Disputing Google reviews](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001180761-how-to-dispute-a-google-review-and-check-on-the-dispute-status)**

* * *

### **Reactivation: Wake Up Your Old Patient List**

Most clinics are sitting on a goldmine of past patients who simply haven’t booked again. Maybe they got busy. Maybe they felt better. Maybe they forgot. The key is this:

They already trust you. You just have to remind them.

#### Segment Your List by Timeframe

Inside GHL, you can filter by:

- Last appointment date

- Last opened/clicked email or SMS

- Tags like “Inactive 30 Days,” “Inactive 90 Days,” etc.


This lets you customize your outreach based on how long it’s been.

**[How to build Database Reactivation Campaigns](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001162999-how-to-build-database-reactivation-campaigns-that-leverage-positive-intent-and-chatbots-in-highlevel)**

#### Craft Your Message Based on Relationship

You’re not blasting a coupon to a stranger — you’re checking in on someone who’s been in your care.

**Example: Soft Check-In (30–60 days)** "Hi John, we hope you’re still feeling great! Just checking in — if any tension or discomfort is back, we’re here to help. Let us know if you’d like to get back on the schedule."

**Example: Reactivation Offer (90+ days)** "Hi Amanda, we haven’t seen you in a while! If you’re ready to check back in, we’re offering returning patients a full re-evaluation and adjustment for just $49 through \[Date\]. Book here: \[Link\]"

#### Build the Automation Once — Then Let It Run

Inside GHL, you can:

- Set a trigger based on “last appointment date”

- Send an email or SMS based on that trigger

- Add conditional logic (e.g., if no response in 3 days, send follow-up)

- Alert your front desk if a reply comes in


You can even stack this with review requests, newsletters, or seasonal promos.

### **Smart Reactivation Campaign Ideas**

| Campaign Type | Message Angle | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Post-Summer Reset | “Get aligned after travel, sun, and stress.” | Patients who vanished over the summer |
| Anniversary Check-In | “Can you believe it’s been a year since your first visit?” | Loyal patients needing re-evaluation |
| Pain Prevention Plan | “Stay ahead of discomfort before it comes back.” | Once-a-month maintenance patients |
| Birthday Outreach | “A birthday adjustment on us?” | Adds a personal, memorable touch |

* * *

### **Final Word**

Your reputation brings patients in. Your systems keep them coming back.

You don’t need to beg for reviews or chase lapsed patients. With GoHighLevel, you can:

- Automatically request, collect, and showcase glowing 5-star reviews

- Set and forget smart reactivation campaigns

- Keep your schedule full with patients who already know and trust your clinic


This is how you grow without always being “on.”
