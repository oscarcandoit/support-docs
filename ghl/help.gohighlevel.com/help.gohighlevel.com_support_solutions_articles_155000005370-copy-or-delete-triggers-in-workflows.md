# **What is the Copy and Delete Trigger Feature?**

Duplicating or removing triggers is now faster and easier than ever. Previously, users had to manually recreate similar triggers or click into each one just to delete them. With these new quality-of-life improvements, you can now instantly duplicate any trigger with all its logic intact—or remove one directly from the canvas using a simple dropdown menu.

## **Key Benefits of the Copy and Delete Trigger Update**

Get more done with less effort by reusing and managing triggers in a smarter way.

- **Duplicate in seconds** — Copy any trigger and reuse it immediately

- **Automatic naming** — Duplicates are labeled “Copy of \[Trigger Name\]” so you instantly know the origin

- **Quick edits** — Easily tweak filter conditions on copied triggers

- **One-click delete** — No need to open the trigger to remove it

- **Cleaner workflow canvas** — Easily manage and refine your automation logic

- **Fewer manual errors** — Reduce mistakes by duplicating proven trigger setups


## **How to Use Copy and Delete for Triggers**

Speed up your workflow editing process using the new options in the trigger card’s menu.

## **Copy Trigger**

Copying triggers allows you to build faster when automations share similar logic. Instead of starting from scratch, just duplicate an existing trigger and make small edits.

### **Steps to Copy a Trigger:**

1. Click the **three-dot menu** on the trigger card

2. Select **“Copy”**

3. A new trigger will appear with the label: **Copy of “\[Trigger Name\]”**

4. Update the trigger’s filters or conditions if needed

5. Click **Save**


? **Pro Tip:** You can copy the same trigger multiple times and adjust each one for different contact segments or logic branches.

## **Delete Trigger**

Deleting triggers is now faster—no need to click into the trigger first. This makes it easier to clean up test triggers or outdated automation logic.

### **Steps to Delete a Trigger:**

1. Click the **three-dot menu** on the trigger card

2. Click **“Delete”**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047382707/original/vYDC540acTYyNilb5M-h9VnhiOSh0veRSQ.png?1748447995)**

3. Confirm the deletion

4. The trigger will be removed from the workflow instantly


⚠️ **Note**: Deletion is permanent—be sure to confirm before removing any trigger.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does the copied trigger include all filter settings from the original?**

Yes, the duplicated trigger is an exact copy—including filters, logic, and setup.

**Q: Can I rename the copied trigger?**

Yes! Simply open the copied trigger and edit the name field.

**Q: Will deleting a trigger impact my past automations?**

No. It only removes the trigger from the current workflow canvas and does not affect prior automation runs.

**Q: Is there an undo option for deleting a trigger?**

Not at this time. Always double-check before confirming a deletion.

**Q: Where can I use the Copy Trigger feature?**

You can use it on any workflow that includes trigger cards—no limitations!
