# **What is Stripe Payment Method Management?**

Stripe Payment Method Management allows you to configure which payment options (like credit cards, wallets, bank debits) are available across various HighLevel product areas, directly inside your HighLevel account. This eliminates the need to manage payment methods separately on Stripe’s dashboard, streamlining operations and improving payment setup control.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Stripe Payment Method Management**

Understanding how managing Stripe payment methods directly in HighLevel benefits your business helps you make the most out of this feature.

- **Centralized Control**: Manage all your Stripe payment options without leaving HighLevel.

- **Separate Live and Test Modes**: Customize payment methods individually for live and test environments.

- **Checkout-Specific Visibility**: Only available payment methods will show in each checkout’s options.

- **Subscription-Specific Settings**: Manage unique payment configurations specifically for subscriptions.

- **Reduced Dependency on Stripe Dashboard**: No longer necessary to edit payment methods in Stripe.

- **Seamless User Experience**: Streamlined configuration leads to faster setup across invoices, funnels, forms, and stores.

- **Funnels - Two-Step Order Form**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What are the transaction fees for Stripe?**

Stripe transaction fees vary depending on your country and the type of payment method used. Generally, Stripe charges a percentage of each transaction plus a fixed fee. Because pricing differs by region, you should always refer to [Stripe’s official pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing) for the most accurate and up-to-date details.

**Q: Why don’t I see the Subscriptions list in HighLevel?**

The **Subscriptions list** only becomes available after you’ve added at least one subscription product in **Live Mode** within the respective sub-account. This requirement comes directly from Stripe.

**Q: What happens if I already have payment methods configured in Stripe?**

Your existing settings are preserved. Default payment methods for product areas or checkouts will match your original Stripe setup unless you update them inside HighLevel.

**Q: Will Live and Test modes have separate settings?**

Yes! You can configure payment methods independently for Live and Test environments, allowing full flexibility during development and production.

**Q: Why don’t I see the Subscriptions dropdown?**

The Subscriptions settings become available **only after** adding at least one subscription product in Live Mode in that sub-account, according to Stripe’s rules.

**Q: Are these changes applied to all sub-accounts?**

Each sub-account connected to Stripe needs to configure its payment methods individually under its Payments settings.
