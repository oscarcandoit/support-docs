# **Overview of Using Brand Boards in Funnels & Websites**

Brand Boards are reusable design kits that bundle your company’s logos, color palette, and typography. Once a Brand Board is created, its assets appear inside the funnel and website builder. This lets you apply the correct styles with one click, making it easy to keep your consistent branding across all websites and funnels.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using Brand Boards in Funnels & Websites**

Brand Boards accelerate page creation and ensure brand consistency:

- **Brand Consistency:** Using Brand Board options make it easy to create or update sites that match your brand

- **Save Time**: No more hunting for the right color or remembering HEX codes. Brand Boards streamline your workflow

- **Instant Brand Palette Access:** Your approved brand colors and fonts appear within the site builder, removing the need to copy HEX codes or refer to external branding guides

- **Centralized Maintenance:** Refresh your Brand Board once and the updated colors, fonts, and logos populate every picker in the builder within the sub-account

## **How to Use Brand Boards in Websites & Funnels**

You must have a brand board already created to use in the funnel or website builder. To learn how to create a Brand Board, see: How to Create a Brand Board

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will updating a Brand Board automatically change existing colors in my funnels or websites?**

No. Updating a Brand Board does not retroactively affect previously created funnel or website pages.

**Q: How can I set a default Brand Board for new projects?**

Go to **Marketing → Brand Boards**, click the **three-dot** menu next to the board you'd like to use, and select **Set as Default**. This will apply the selected Brand Board to new funnels and websites by default. [Click here for more details on this topic.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003138)

**Q: Why aren’t my Brand Board colors showing up in the color picker?**

Brand Board colors will only appear in the funnel or website builder if a Brand Board is actively selected. Go to the Design tab and make sure a Brand Board is applied.

**Q: Can I have multiple Brand Boards in one sub‑account?**

Yes. Create as many as you like, but only one can be set as _Default_ at a time.

**Q: What happens if I delete a Brand Board?**

Any stylings or colors already used in pages remain, but the board will disappear from pickers.
