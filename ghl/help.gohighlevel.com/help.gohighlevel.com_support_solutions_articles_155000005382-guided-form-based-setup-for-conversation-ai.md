# **What is the Guided Form Bot?**

The Guided Form Bot is a user-friendly setup option within Conversation AI that removes the need for manual prompt engineering. Instead, it walks you through creating a bot using a structured form. You define key goals—like collecting contact details or answering FAQs—and the system builds a logic-driven, objective-based conversation flow behind the scenes.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Guided Form Bot**

**The Guided Form Bot is ideal for users who want powerful bot functionality without needing deep technical expertise. It balances simplicity with flexibility, enabling high-quality conversations in less time.**

- No need to write prompts

- Quick setup—create a bot in under 3 minutes

- Reliable, logic-based answers tailored to your inputs

- Easy way to capture leads and qualify contacts

- Reusable bot templates for multiple campaigns

- Works seamlessly with Conversation AI workflows and tagging


## **How to Set Up the Guided Form Bot**

**Follow this step-by-step guide to set up your Guided Form Bot, define its behavior, and connect it to key actions within your CRM.**

* * *

### **Step 1: Access the Create Bot Page**

To get started:

1. Go to **Conversation AI → Bots** in the left-hand menu.

2. Click **Create Bot**.

3. The Guided Form interface opens by default.

### **Step 2: Input Brand Information (Optional)**

While optional, adding brand information helps customize the tone and personality of your bot.

- Business Name

- Business Type

- Tone of Voice (e.g., professional, friendly, casual)

This allows the AI to respond more naturally in a tone consistent with your brand identity.

### **Step 3: Configure Basic Bot Settings**

These core settings determine how your bot behaves in conversations:

- **Initial Message**: The first thing the bot will say to users.

- **Language**: Select the language your bot should use.

- **Bot Name**: Give your bot a friendly identifier.

- **Behavior Type**:

  - **Auto-Pilot**: Fully automated.

  - **Suggestive**: Sends reply suggestions to the user.

### **Step 4: Define Objectives and Questions**

Add all the objectives you’d like the bot to complete.

- Use the **Add Question / Objective** button to create each.

- Enable **Skip if Already Filled** to prevent asking for existing contact data.

- Drag and drop questions to reorder them.


Common use cases:

- Ask for name, email, phone

- Qualify lead with Yes/No questions

- Offer scheduling links

* * *

### **Step 5: Setup Actions for Each Objective**

Once you’ve defined your questions, determine what the bot should do when objectives are completed.

Options include:

- **Trigger a Workflow** (e.g., enroll in email sequence)

- **Update a Custom Field** (e.g., save “Preferred Contact Time”)

- **Assign Tags** (e.g., “Interested in Demo”)


These actions help automate and personalize follow-ups based on user responses.

### **Step 6: Final Review and Additional Settings**

Before saving your bot, review all sections to make sure everything looks good. Then, configure any advanced settings:

- **Bot Availability**: Set time/day availability.

- **Channels**: Choose where the bot is active (SMS, Webchat, Instagram, etc.).

- **Fallback Message**: Custom message if the bot can’t handle a question.


Click **Save** to launch the bot!

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I switch between Guided Form and prompt-based bots?**

Yes! From the bot creation screen, click the dropdown arrow next to “Create Bot” to choose your setup method.

**Q: Can I edit the bot after it’s created?**

Absolutely. Just open the bot from the Bot Manager and click “Edit.”

**Q: What happens if the user doesn’t answer a question?**

The bot will either retry, move on, or end the conversation—based on how you’ve configured each objective.

**Q: Can I duplicate a bot?**

Yes. Use the **Duplicate** option in the bot menu to reuse a configuration.

**Q: Can I use Guided Form bots across channels like Instagram or WhatsApp?**

Yes, as long as those channels are integrated into your HighLevel setup.

* * *

### **Next Steps**

- **Test Your Bot**: Use the test chat window to validate the setup and ensure the objectives trigger as expected.

- **Monitor Conversations**: Track engagement in the Conversation view to see how users interact.

- **Use with Workflows**: Leverage Workflow triggers and actions to automate your lead nurturing process.

- **Explore Bot Variants**: Create variations of the bot for different use cases like customer support or event registration.
