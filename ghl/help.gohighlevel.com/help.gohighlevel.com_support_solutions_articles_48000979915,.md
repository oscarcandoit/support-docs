## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I trigger automation based on survey answers?**

Yes, use the "Survey Submitted" trigger in workflows to start automations.

**Q: Do survey answers show up in the CRM automatically?**

If the survey includes fields that match contact properties (e.g., email), those fields will update the contact record.

**Q: Can multiple submissions from the same contact be tracked?**

Yes, all submissions are tracked independently—even if a contact submits the same survey multiple times. This is useful for recurring feedback or event check-ins.

**Q: Can I see which survey a response belongs to if I use multiple surveys?**

Yes, each submission record shows the name of the associated survey and you can filter results by survey name using the dropdown.
