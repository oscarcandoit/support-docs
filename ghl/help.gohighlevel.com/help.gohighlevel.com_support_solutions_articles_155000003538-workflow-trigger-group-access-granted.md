## Overview

The Group Access Granted trigger workflows allows for automated management of group access, enhancing community interactions and user experience.

## Trigger Name

Group Access Granted

## Trigger Description

The "Group Access Granted" action is triggered when a user is granted access to a specific group within a community. This automation ensures that users receive timely updates and can engage with relevant content and members.

## How to Configure

1. **Navigate to the Workflow Builder:** Access the Workflow Builder in your GoHighLevel account.
2. **Create a New Workflow:**
   - Click on "Create a Workflow."
   - Select the relevant trigger type: "Group Access Granted."
3. **Configure Trigger Details**:
   - Specify which group access is being granted.
   - Add any subsequent actions you wish to automate (e.g., sending welcome messages or notifications).
4. **Test Your Workflow**: Ensure that the workflow operates as expected by testing it in a controlled environment.
5. **Save and Activate**: Once confirmed, save your workflow and activate it for use.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033166714/original/cX0XHz6WsqJBPkZCVfL1CTMvuV0TJKmg_A.png?1726745441)


## Example

For instance, if a new member joins a book club community, you can set up a workflow that automatically grants them access to the "Book Discussions" group. This ensures they receive immediate updates about upcoming discussions and can engage with other members right away.
