## **Why This Playbook Matters**

You're a master plumber—fixing leaks, unclogging drains, installing fixtures—but how do you consistently attract customers who urgently need your services?

Most plumbing companies rely heavily on word-of-mouth or costly referrals.

But the reality?

✅ **88% of plumbing customers** search online before calling.

✅ **75% of plumbing leads** go to the plumber who responds first.

✅ Repeat plumbing jobs & loyal customers are your most profitable asset.

❌ If you’re not found, not responding quickly, or failing to manage leads efficiently—you’re letting money flow down the drain.

This **Getting Started Playbook** shows you the top 5 ways to set up **HighLevel** to start attracting more plumbing customers immediately, securing repeat business, and automating the entire process.
