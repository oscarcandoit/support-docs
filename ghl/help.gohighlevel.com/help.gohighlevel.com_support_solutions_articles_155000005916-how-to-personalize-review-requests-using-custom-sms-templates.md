# **What is Custom SMS Template?**

A custom SMS template in HighLevel’s Reputation Management allows you to design and manage the exact messages sent in recurring review requests. You can personalize each message with custom tokens, unique text, and dynamic image links so every recipient gets a message that feels tailored to them. This level of customization helps increase engagement and encourage more customers to leave reviews.

By using custom SMS templates, you can maintain consistent branding, speak in your business’s voice, and deliver visually appealing messages that stand out. Whether you choose a pre-built design or create one from scratch, you have full control over the content and presentation of your review requests.

- **Personalized Messaging:** Personalize each SMS with custom tokens and brand-specific language

- **Dynamic Image Personalization:** Add dynamic image URLs that update with contact-specific data, using NiftyImages compatibility for personalized visuals that make requests more eye-catching

- **Flexible Design Options:** Choose from pre-built templates or create one from scratch

- **Simplified Template Management:** Quickly create, edit, and assign templates by customizing the name, message, tokens, and image URLs, ensuring consistent, on-brand follow-ups

- **Streamlined Campaigns:** Automatically assign your preferred recurring SMS template to follow-up campaigns

**Set SMS Send Timing**

Use the **When to send SMS after check-in?** dropdown to decide how soon a review request is sent after a customer’s check-in. You can choose options like Immediately, 1 Hour, 2 Hours, 4 Hours, or set a Custom delay that fits your follow-up strategy.

**Set Repeat Frequency**

In the **Until clicked, repeat this every** dropdown, choose how often the SMS review request should be resent until the recipient interacts with it. Options include fixed intervals like 3 Days, 1 Week, or 1 Month, as well as a Custom option for more flexibility.

**Customize Repeat Interval**

If you selected **Custom** for the repeat frequency, set the exact number and unit of time here. Use the plus/minus buttons to adjust the number, and choose between **Hours** or **Days** to match how often you want follow-up messages to be sent.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use different SMS templates for each retry in a recurring review request sequence?**

Yes. In the **Set SMS Templates** window, you can assign a specific template to each retry stage (Retry 1, Retry 2, etc.). This allows you to vary your follow-up messages for better engagement, while still keeping all messages within the same recurring sequence.

**Q: What’s the difference between “Request with Image” and “Add Custom Image URL” in the SMS Template Builder?**

**Request with Image** lets you upload a static image file (SVG, PNG, JPG) that will appear in your SMS. **Add Custom Image URL** lets you insert a link to a hosted image—this can be a dynamic image URL (e.g., from NiftyImages) that changes based on contact-specific data, allowing for more personalized visuals.

**Q: If I choose “Custom” for the repeat frequency, can I use hours instead of days?**

Yes. When you select **Custom** in the “Until clicked, repeat this every” setting, you can choose the exact number of **hours** or **days** between messages. Use the plus/minus buttons to set the desired number, then select your preferred time unit from the dropdown.

**Q: Can I duplicate an existing template and make changes without affecting the original?**

Yes. In the **Manage Your SMS Templates** section, click the copy icon next to a template to create a duplicate. The duplicate is separate from the original, so you can edit it without impacting the original template’s content or settings.
