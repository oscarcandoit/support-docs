# **What is a Recurring Invoice?**

A recurring invoice is a pre-scheduled invoice template that automatically sends to your customers based on the frequency you define. Instead of creating and sending invoices manually every billing cycle, you set it up once and let the system handle the rest.

Recurring invoices are especially helpful for businesses that provide ongoing services, subscription plans, or installment-based products. They not only save you time but also ensure your customers receive timely and consistent billing, improving both efficiency and customer experience.

## **Key Benefits of Recurring Invoices**

Recurring invoices provide a reliable and efficient way to manage repeat billing. Instead of handling invoices manually each time, you can automate the process to save effort and give customers a seamless payment experience.

- **Time savings:** Automate repetitive invoicing tasks and focus on running your business.

- **Accuracy:** Reduce manual errors by using a consistent template.

- **Predictable cash flow:** Receive payments on a regular, dependable schedule.

- **Customer convenience:** Provide customers with clear, consistent billing cycles.

- **Professionalism:** Strengthen customer trust with timely and organized invoices.

## **How to Create a Recurring Invoice**

### **Go to the Invoices Tab**

Navigate to the **Payments** section from the left menu and click on **Invoices & Estimates**. This is where you can manage all your invoices, including recurring ones.

### **Create a New Recurring Invoice**

Click the **New** button in the top right corner, then select **New Recurring Invoice**. This option allows you to set up an invoice that automatically repeats on your chosen schedule.

### **Add Business and Customer Details**

Enter your **business information** and select the **customer** who will receive the invoice. You can also add products or services from your catalog, set pricing, taxes, and quantities.

### **Configure Invoice Frequency**

Use the **How often?** dropdown to define how frequently the invoice should be generated (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or custom intervals). This setting controls the billing cycle for your recurring invoice.

### **Understanding Invoice Frequency**

Frequency settings determine how often and when your invoices are generated. Here are some common patterns:

**Regular Intervals:** Invoices are generated at equal time gaps (for example, every 2 days, every week, or every month). Once you set the interval, invoices will keep generating until you stop them manually. Example, If the first invoice is due on July 5 and you set a 7-day interval, the next invoice will be due on July 12, then July 19, and so on.

**Specific Days:** Invoices can be scheduled to go out on a particular day, such as the first Monday of every month. This is useful for businesses that align billing with specific dates, such as weekly service providers or monthly retainers. Example, If the first Monday in August is August 1, the invoice will be due that day. You can also set an end condition, such as stopping the cycle after December 5 (the first Monday in December).

**Annual Billing:** Invoices can be scheduled once a year on the same date, making it ideal for yearly subscriptions, membership renewals, or annual service fees. Example, If you choose December 31, the invoice will be sent on that date each year. If you set the cycle to 5 occurrences, it will end after 5 years.

### **Set Start and End Dates**

Choose the **Start Date** for when the first invoice should be sent, and define the **End condition** (a specific date or after a certain number of occurrences). This ensures the recurring invoice runs only for the desired period.

### **Send in Advance**

Invoices can be sent to the customer a few days before the actual due date. This ensures customers have enough time to review and complete payment before the due date arrives. Example, If an invoice is due on July 18 but you choose to send it 2 days earlier, the customer will receive it on July 16. The next invoice due on August 1 will be sent on July 30.

### **Additional Options for Recurring Invoices**

Enhance your invoices with extra details and customizations. These options allow you to add policies, fees, or attachments that make your invoices more professional and tailored to your business needs.

- **Terms and Conditions:** Add standard policies or important notes that apply to the invoice (e.g., payment timelines, refund policies).

- **Charge Late Fees:** Automatically include a late payment fee if the customer misses the due date.

- **Charge Processing Fees:** Pass on payment gateway or transaction fees to the customer (if enabled in your payment settings).

- **Include Tipping:** Allow customers to add a tip on top of the invoice amount. Useful for service-based businesses.

- **Add Attachment:** Upload supporting documents, contracts, or additional details that should accompany the invoice.

```
Best Practice: Double-check details such as frequency, price, and taxes while the invoice is still in Draft. Once a template becomes Active or Scheduled, these fields cannot be changed.
```

### **End a Recurring Invoice**

From the **More Options (⋮)** menu inside the invoice, select **End Recurring Invoice**. This immediately stops any future invoices from being generated, while preserving the history of invoices already sent.

### **View Invoice History**

Select **View History** from the More Options (⋮) menu to see all invoices generated from a recurring template. This provides a complete timeline of invoices sent, their due dates, and their payment status, helping you track customer billing activity with ease.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052908974/original/Rq0GtGg0yDU1soEcFt7EOmQULnlhqTrskg.png?1756813818)

### **Status and Actions in Recurring Templates**

Recurring invoice templates can have different statuses depending on where they are in the billing process. Each status determines what you can and cannot do with the template. Understanding these statuses helps you know when changes are possible and when they are locked in.

- **Draft:** A template is in Draft when it has been created but not yet activated. At this stage, you can freely edit or delete it. This is the best time to make adjustments to pricing, frequency, or product details.

- **Active:** An Active template is currently generating invoices as per its schedule. You cannot edit or delete it, but you can choose to **End** it if you want to stop future invoices.

- **Scheduled:** A Scheduled template is set up to begin generating invoices at a future date. While you cannot edit it, you can still delete or end it before the cycle starts.

- **Canceled:** A template marked as Canceled will not generate any further invoices. It remains visible for reference, but it can only be deleted if no invoices were ever sent from it.

- **Completed:** A Completed template has finished generating invoices, usually because it reached its end condition (like a set number of cycles). Like Canceled templates, it can only be deleted if no invoices were actually sent.

* * *

### **Manage Recurring Invoice Templates**

From the **Recurring Templates** list view, click the **More Options (⋮)** menu next to a template to manage it. Available actions include:

- **View History:** See invoices generated by the template.

- **View:** Open the template to review its details.

- **End:** Stop future invoices while keeping past ones intact.

- **Delete:** Remove the template (only possible if no invoices have been sent).

- **Clone:** Duplicate the template for reuse with similar settings.

- **Convert to Template:** Save the invoice as a reusable template for automation.

* * *

## **Viewing Sent Invoices and Payment Status**

From the **Recurring Templates** page, click **Details** to open a side panel showing all invoices generated by that template. Each invoice will have one of the following statuses:

- **Sent:** Invoice was delivered successfully

- **Overdue:** Invoice was sent but payment is still pending

- **Paid:** Invoice has been paid by the customer

- **Not Sent:** Delivery failed due to a system error and needs to be resent

You can also view these statuses inside the invoice builder when the recurring template is scheduled.
