# **What is Bulk Actions in Opportunities Cards View?**

**Bulk Actions in Opportunities Cards View** enables users to select multiple opportunity cards within the Kanban view of the Opportunities pipeline. With checkboxes available on each card, you can perform mass updates or actions—such as moving, editing, or deleting opportunities—all without leaving the visual interface. This streamlines workflow for teams managing high-volume pipelines.

* * *

# **Key Benefits of Bulk Actions in Opportunities Cards View**

Enhance your pipeline management experience with these powerful benefits:

- **Faster Workflow:** Update multiple opportunities from the visual Kanban/Card view.

- **No View Switching:** Perform bulk actions without moving to List view.

- **Select All Option:** Select all cards on the current page when viewing 20+ opportunities.

- **Error Prevention:** Disables card drag-and-drop/open during selection mode.

- **Better Accessibility:** Enables all users to manage pipelines easily in their preferred view.

- **Streamlined Management:** Make high-volume updates quickly and efficiently.

# **How To Use Bulk Actions in Opportunities Cards View**

Get started with bulk actions using this simple process:

### **Access the Opportunities Tab**

To begin using bulk actions, navigate to the **Opportunities** tab from the left-hand menu. This opens the card view where all opportunity stages and entries across your pipeline are displayed.

### **Select a Pipeline**

Use the dropdown menu at the top to select the pipeline you want to manage. This filters the Opportunities view to show only entries from the selected pipeline, making bulk updates more focused and efficient.

### **Choose Your View Mode**

Use the toggle icon at the top-right to switch between **Cards view** and **List view**, both of which support bulk actions.

- **Cards view** is helpful when you want to visually scan and select opportunities by their pipeline stage before applying bulk changes.
- **List view** is ideal for working with large volumes of data, as it allows quick scrolling, column sorting, and mass selection for bulk edits.

Choose the view based on whether you’re prioritizing visual pipeline context or high-volume record management.

### **Select  Multiple Opportunities**

In order to select opportunities, just hover over to them and click the checkbox that appear at the top right corner of the respective opportunity.

### **Edit Opportunity Cards**

After selecting multiple opportunities in either **Cards** or **List** view, an **Edit** button will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking this allows you to apply changes to all selected records in one go.

### **Choose a Field to Edit**

After clicking **Edit**, use the Bulk Edit panel to select a field you want to update across multiple opportunities. Fields like status, value, pipeline, and owner are commonly used for reassignments, cleanup, or campaign-based updates. In the next part, we will explain some of the fields like Assign owner.

### **Assign a New Owner**

Select the **Owner** field to reassign opportunities to a different team member. This is especially useful when redistributing leads during team shifts, vacations, or coverage gaps.

### **Change Pipeline and Stage**

Use the **Pipeline** and **Stage** fields to relocate multiple opportunities across workflows. This is helpful when leads need to be regrouped under a new sales process or post-campaign phase.

### **Update Opportunity Status**

Select **Status** to mark selected opportunities as Open, Won, Lost, or Abandoned. This streamlines updates after call reviews, outreach sequences, or campaign follow-ups.

### **Use “Select All” for Bulk Updates**

When working with large volumes, you can click **Select all \[number\]** to include every opportunity visible in the current pipeline. This saves time when applying the same change across an entire group of records.
