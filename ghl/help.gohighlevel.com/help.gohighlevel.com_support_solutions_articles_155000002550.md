Yes, you can configure the workflow to activate for multiple forms by adding more filters or setting broader criteria.

**Q. What happens if the form is submitted multiple times by the same user?**

The trigger activates each time the form is submitted. Use conditions or cooldown periods in workflows to manage duplicate submissions effectively.

For example, if your form collects Name, Email, and Feedback, you can insert these fields into your email body using merge fields like {{contact.name}}, {{contact.email}}, or custom fields linked to your form. When the email is sent, these placeholders are automatically replaced with the actual data submitted in the form.

**Q. How do I handle form submissions with incomplete data?**

You can add conditions within the workflow to validate required fields and take specific actions, such as sending an alert or skipping incomplete submissions.

**Q. Is this trigger compatible with external form tools?**

The Form Submitted trigger works with forms created within your CRM. For external tools, you may need to use an integration or ebhook to capture submissions.
