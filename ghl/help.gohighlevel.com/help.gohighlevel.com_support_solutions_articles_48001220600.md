# Common uses cases for Payments and Invoices

Modified on: Fri, 23 May, 2025 at 10:14 AM

Payments are used to pay for goods or services. They can be made by credit card, debit card, bank transfer, cheque, cash, or any other method of payment. Invoices are used to record the amount that has been paid for a product or service. The invoice is usually sent with the payment so that it can be tracked as part of the accounting process.

In this article we will go over some common or popular use cases for using payments and invoices.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:****Can I use GoHighLevel payments to track partial payments for invoices?**

Yes, HighLevel allows you to track partial payments. You can create an invoice with the full amount and update it each time a partial payment is made. This helps you keep accurate records of outstanding balances.

**Q: **Is it possible to customize the appearance of invoices sent to clients?****

Currently, HighLevel provides a standard invoice template. While you can add custom details like your business name, logo, and notes, more advanced customization options, such as adjusting layouts or colors, are not available at this time.

**Q: **Can I set up recurring invoices for subscription-based services?****

The text here has no limits or restrictions. You should add as much text as needed to explain the answer to this Yes, you can create recurring invoices for subscription-based services. While HighLevel doesn’t have an automated recurring invoice feature, you can duplicate a previously sent invoice and set reminders to send it periodically.

**Q: **How can I integrate third-party payment processors?****

HighLevel supports integration with popular payment processors like Stripe and PayPal. You’ll need to connect your account via the integrations section in the platform. Once linked, you can accept payments directly through your invoices.

**Q: Why does an invoice show “Payment Processing” even after a client has paid?**

If your invoice shows “Payment Processing,” it means the payment has been initiated but not yet settled. This typically happens with ACH bank transfers or payment methods like PayPal eCheck, which require 2–5 business days to clear. Once the payment is successfully processed, the invoice status will automatically update to “Paid.”
