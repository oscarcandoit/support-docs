## **What is the Conversation AI Bot Dashboard?**

The Conversation AI Agents Dashboard provides a unified, high-level view of performance across all Conversation AI agents in your HighLevel account. Instead of visiting each agent’s page to gather insights, you can analyze cross‑agent activity from a single screen and then drill into a specific agent as needed.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Conversation AI Bot Dashboard**

Understanding how this dashboard accelerates evaluation and decision-making helps teams prioritize the right improvements and allocate resources effectively.

- **Single, comprehensive view:** See all Conversation AI agents’ metrics on one screen to reduce time spent switching between individual agents.

- **Faster decision-making:** Use consolidated insights to quickly identify trends, outliers, and opportunities for optimization.

- **Targeted analysis:** Filter by **Date Range**, **Channel**, and **Agent** to isolate what matters and compare performance over different periods or channels.

- **Permission-based visibility:** Control who can access the dashboard by enabling a specific permission for the users who need it.

- **No configuration changes required:** The dashboard adds visibility on top of your existing Conversation AI setup—no additional bot changes are needed.


* * *

## **Access & Permissions**

Proper permissioning ensures the right users have access to sensitive analytics while maintaining security and governance.

- Access to the consolidated dashboard is controlled by a permission: **View Conversation AI Dashboard**.

- When enabled for a user, the dashboard appears on the **Conversation AI home page** and also at the **agent level**.

- Admins can toggle access via **Agency Settings → Team → Edit User → Roles & Permissions → AI Agents → View Conversation AI Dashboard**.

## **How to Access the Conversation AI Bot Dashboard**

Accessing the dashboard is simple and only takes a few clicks. Here you can access the metrics based on date range, communication channels, and also through your desired AI Agent.

### **Step 1:** Go to Conversation AI under AI Agents from your HighLevel dashboard.

### **Step 2:** Select the bot you want to review from the dashboard tab.

### **Step 3:** Use the **channel selector** and **date range picker** to filter data by platform or timeframe.

## **Filters: Date Range, Channel, and All Agents**

Filters allow you to refine the dashboard to answer specific questions—such as which channel is driving outcomes or how a single agent performs over time.

- **Date Range:** Narrow results to specific periods (for example, last week vs. last month) to identify trend changes.

- **Channel:** Focus on conversations from a particular channel when comparing performance across communication sources.

- **Agent:** Isolate a single Conversation AI agent’s metrics to evaluate impact and troubleshoot effectively.


* * *

## **Understanding Dashboard Metrics**

Clear definitions prevent misinterpretation and help teams make high-confidence decisions based on consistent, repeatable metrics. Metric names may vary slightly in the UI over time. Use in‑app labels and tooltips as the source of truth if wording changes.

- **Total Unique Contacts:** Count of distinct contacts who engaged with Conversation AI within the selected time range (deduped contacts across messages).

- **Actions Triggered:** Number of automated actions initiated from AI-driven interactions (such as starting a workflow, applying a tag, creating a task, or transferring a conversation). Actual action types counted depend on your Conversation AI configuration.

- **Appointments Booked:** Count of appointments created via Conversation AI. Use this alongside your Calendars to validate specific bookings.

- **Average Messages per Contact:** Average number of messages exchanged with each unique contact over the selected period. This helps gauge conversation depth and efficiency.

- **Time Saved:** Estimated time savings from automated handling of conversations and tasks. This metric provides directional insight into productivity gains.
