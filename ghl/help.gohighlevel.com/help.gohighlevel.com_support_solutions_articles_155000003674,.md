We are excited to announce the release of a new pricing model in the App Marketplace - One-time pricing model.

## **Why is this feature important?**

In Q3, we are launching multiple asset-heavy modules in the marketplace - Snapshots and Widgets. These modules, once installed, cannot be reversed. Hence, a one-time pricing model is necessary for the success of Snapshots and Widgets modules on the App Marketplace.

## **What is new?**

- Developers can configure one-time pricing plans while creating apps.
- For apps of Agency & Sub-account distribution-type, in which agencies can bulk-install across their sub-accounts, developers can configure different pricing for agency and per sub-account.
- New filters on pricing have been added to enable app discovery based on pricing models
- Users can install apps paying a one-time fees
