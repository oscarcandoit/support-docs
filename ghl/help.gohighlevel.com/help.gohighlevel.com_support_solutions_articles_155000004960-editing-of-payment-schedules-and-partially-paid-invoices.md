# **What is the Edit Feature for Partially Paid Invoices?**

This feature allows you to modify invoices after a payment has already been made. Whether it’s adjusting payment terms, updating tax details, or adding a new product mid-project, you can now make changes directly to a partially paid invoice and keep everything accurate and up to date.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Editing Partially Paid Invoices**

Managing ongoing or changing customer needs is easier than ever with invoice editing flexibility.

    •    Edit invoice details like name, due date, terms, and notes.

    •    Add, remove, or update products—even create new ones on the fly.

    •    Modify the invoice total, taxes, and associated business details.

    •    Fully control and edit payment schedules, including due dates and amounts.

    •    Resend the updated invoice to the customer without reissuing it.

* * *

## **How to Edit a Partially Paid Invoice**

Once an invoice has received a payment, it enters the **partially paid** state. You can still make updates using the following steps:

    1\.    Go to the **Payments** or **Invoices** module.

    2\.    Open the invoice that is in **Partially Paid** status.

    3\.    Click **Edit** next to any of the following sections:

    •    **Invoice Details**: Update the invoice name, due date, terms, or notes.

    •    **Products**: Add/remove products or create a new product instantly.

    •    **Amounts and Business Info**: Adjust pricing, taxes, or business details.

    •    **Payment Schedule**: Edit existing schedules or add/delete payment milestones.

_Add Screenshot: Each editable section (Details, Products, Payment Schedule) with “Edit” options visible_

    4\.    Make your changes and click **Save**.

    5\.    Optional: Click **Resend Invoice** to send the updated version to your client.

All updates reflect immediately and maintain invoice continuity without requiring you to void and reissue.

* * *

## **Editable Invoice Sections**

Below is a breakdown of what each editable section includes and how it supports dynamic business needs:

**Invoice Details**

Make administrative updates without impacting the payment records.

    •    Change invoice **name**

    •    Adjust the **due date**

    •    Modify **terms and notes** for clarity or updates

* * *

**Product Management**

Maintain accurate billing by adjusting what’s being invoiced—even after a payment.

    •    **Add new products** or remove existing ones

    •    Update **quantity, description, or unit price**

    •    **Create products on the fly** as needed

* * *

**Amounts and Business Information**

Ensure compliance and accuracy by updating billing and tax-related info.

    •    Edit the **invoice total** or apply changes in tax

    •    Update **business details** if needed for legal or communication purposes

* * *

**Payment Schedule Management**

Stay in sync with clients’ changing financial situations or evolving project timelines.

    •    **Add**, **edit**, or **delete** payment schedule entries

    •    Modify **due dates** and **amounts** within each milestone

    •    Restructure installment plans without recreating the invoice

* * *

## **Why This Feature Matters**

Editing partially paid invoices has been a highly requested feature, and it brings major improvements to flexibility and billing accuracy.

    •    **Adapt to Customer Requests**: Clients may need mid-project updates or changes after their first payment.

    •    **Avoid Reissuing Invoices**: Maintain audit trails and reduce confusion by editing instead of starting over.

    •    **Real-Time Workflow Adjustments**: Make changes on the fly without interrupting the billing or delivery process.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I edit the invoice after it’s fully paid?**

No. This feature only applies to invoices in a **partially paid** status.

**Q: Will editing the invoice affect payment records?**

No, previous payments remain intact and unchanged. Only unpaid sections are updated.

**Q: Can I resend the invoice after editing?**

Yes. After saving your changes, click **Resend Invoice** to send the updated version to the client.

**Q: Can I change the client on a partially paid invoice?**

No. The associated client cannot be changed once a payment has been made.

**Q: Are these changes visible to the client immediately?**

Yes, once saved and resent, clients will see the updated invoice details.

* * *

**Next Steps**

    •    Open one of your **partially paid** invoices and explore the new edit options.

    •    Review your client communication process to ensure they’re informed when invoices are updated.
