# Added ability to dismiss “Missing Info” alerts on entity profiles

Modified on: Tue, 23 Sep, 2025 at 11:15 PM

Users can now

dismiss missing info alerts on the entity detail screen for fields that are not applicable

to a business (e.g., TikTok URL, YouTube page, etc.).

?

Key Benefits

- Cleaner UX:
Alerts are no longer cluttered with irrelevant missing fields.
- Personalized Control:
Agencies and businesses decide what’s relevant — not a one-size-fits-all template.
- Accurate Profile Scores:
Dismissed fields are excluded from completeness scoring, making the score more reflective of actual completion.
- Reversible:
Accidentally dismissed something? Toggle dismissed fields back on anytime.

?

How It Works

- Navigate to any
location/entity profile
.
- In the “
Missing Info
” section, click "
Configure" on the Profile Health Card

- A modal will appear where you can select all the fields not applicable.

- Once confirmed,
the alert disappears
and the
profile score updates accordingly
.

Want to bring something back?

- Use the “
Configure
” button to view and “
Re-enable
” any field.
- Once re-enabled, it reappears in your alerts and profile scoring.

Profile Score Behavior

- Dismissed fields are excluded from both the numerator and denominator of profile completeness.
- Example: If 2 fields are dismissed from a 10-field profile, the score is calculated as Completed / 8.
