## **Setup Personal Booking Calendar**

Your personal booking calendar is your best friend when it comes to managing appointments. Once it's up, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

To use Google Calendar for scheduling appointments, it's essential to first create a HighLevel Personal Booking Calendar. This booking calendar serves as the foundation for your scheduling rules—allowing you to configure availability, buffer times, meeting durations, and reminders. Even if you use Google Calendar daily, this calendar is required to manage how bookings are accepted and displayed within HighLevel.

1. Navigate to **Calendar > C** **alendar Settings**.
