# Wallet - Auto Recharge, Smart Adjustment and Cancellation

Modified on: Wed, 30 Jul, 2025 at 12:05 PM

Keeping your HighLevel wallet funded ensures uninterrupted SMS, email, and phone usage for you and your clients. **Auto  Recharge** automatically tops up your wallet balance when it dips below a threshold, while **Smart Adjustment** intelligently increases that top‑up amount when your usage grows. This guide explains both features, why they matter, and how to fine‑tune or disable them to maintain cost control.

# **What are Auto Recharge & Smart Adjustment?**

Auto Recharge adds funds to your HighLevel wallet whenever the balance falls under a limit you decide. Smart Adjustment is an adaptive tier system that , based on recent recharge frequency , raises your Auto Recharge amount to ensure fewer funding interruptions as your volume scales.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Auto Recharge & Smart Adjustment**

Keeping your wallet funded isn’t just convenient; it protects campaign deliverability and client satisfaction.

- **Uninterrupted Service:** Prevents SMS, email, and call failures caused by insufficient wallet funds.

- **Time Savings:** Eliminates manual deposits, allowing you to focus on revenue‑generating work.

- **Scales With You:** Smart Adjustment increases the recharge tier automatically as your usage grows, reducing the number of recharges and potential card authorization holds.

- **Budget Visibility:** Threshold and recharge amounts are fully configurable, giving you predictable cash‑flow control.

- **One‑Click Disable:** Turn Auto Recharge off at any time if you prefer a fixed recharge amount.

* * *

## **Auto Recharge**

Auto Recharge uses two simple fields:

1. **Recharge Amount** – The dollar amount added to your wallet each time Auto Recharge triggers.

2. **Threshold Balance** – The wallet balance that triggers the recharge once it’s reached or passed.


**Example**: If Recharge Amount = $50 and Threshold Balance = $25, then when your wallet balance hits $24.99, HighLevel instantly charges your saved payment method $50 and deposits it in your wallet.

## **Smart Adjustment**

Smart Adjustment monitors how often Auto Recharge fires. When the same recharge amount triggers more than **three times within any seven‑day window**, HighLevel moves you to the next preset tier (e.g., from $200 → $500).

**Why it matters:** As your sending volume grows, larger recharges mean fewer credit‑card holds and fewer risk‑flag reviews by card issuers.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How does HighLevel determine the next tier when Smart Adjustment upgrades?**

It moves to the very next predefined recharge tier (e.g., $200 → $500 → $1,000). Custom amounts are not skipped.

**Q:** **Will I receive email notifications when Auto Recharge or Smart Adjustment occurs?**

Yes. Billing notification emails are sent to agency owner admins by default.

**Q: Can I change the Threshold Balance without affecting Smart Adjustment history?**

Yes. Adjusting the threshold does not reset your usage count. The three‑in‑seven‑days rule still applies.

**Q: What happens if my saved payment method fails?**

HighLevel will retry the charge up to three times over 24 hours and email you each attempt. Service pauses after final failure.
