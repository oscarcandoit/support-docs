# **What is Geographic Analytics (State & City Drilldown)?**

Geographic Analytics is an interactive heat-map that visualizes web traffic all the way from country to state to city level. By drilling down, you can identify high-interest pockets within a region, compare performance across different local markets, and fine-tune your marketing strategy in real time. Both map and ranked list update the moment you change the dropdown—no manual reload required. This live experience is ideal for meetings or screen shares where insights have to appear the second you need them.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Geographic Analytics**

Use this feature to turn raw location data into actionable insights:

- **Hyper-Local Targeting:** Zero in on top-performing cities to run geo-focused ads and promotions.

- **Smarter Budget Allocation:** Shift ad spend toward states generating the most engaged visits.

- **Campaign** **Comparison:** Measure regional lift after launching location-based offers.

- **Faster Decisions:** Live refresh keeps maps and ranked lists updated without page reloads.

- **Unified View:** All visitor counts, maps, and rankings live in one dashboard for easy reporting.

* * *

## **Geographic Dropdown**

Switch between Country, State, and City with a single selector to instantly change the heat-map and ranked list. This dropdown removes extra clicks and keeps your workflow focused on insight rather than navigation.

* * *

## **Total Visitors and Ranked Lists**

Each drill-down level includes a side-panel list that automatically ranks the top regions by visit count. The list updates in real time as you change levels, making it effortless to spot your highest-traffic areas at a glance.

A running total of all visits for the selected drill-down level stays visible above the map. As you move from state to city, the total refreshes automatically so you always know the full audience size you’re analyzing.

* * *

## **Dynamic Heatmap**

Colors on the map deepen as traffic increases, giving you a quick visual cue of hotspots without digging through spreadsheets. Move your cursor across the map to reveal precise visitor numbers for each state or city. Tooltips appear immediately, saving you from scrolling the side list when you need a quick figure.

## **How To Access Geographic Analytics**

Geographic Analytics works out of the box for any sub-account within the Sites Analytics page. Follow these steps to start exploring your data:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Analytics

- From your sub-account dashboard, use the left-side navigation bar to go to **Sites**

- Select the **Analytics** tab from the top navigation ribbon


#### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054959412/original/b90Q9oY3-iGpsGW6Z2LHAfIw2hecD3pslw.png?1759254164)        **Step 2:** View Geographic Analytics card

Scroll down to the Geographic Analytics card (located beneath Page Views). From here you can:

- Use the drill-down dropdown (Country / State / City) above the map to choose your level.

- Hover any shaded region to see its visitor count.

- Review the ranked list on the right to compare top locations.

#### **Step 3:** Use Data

Apply insights—such as shifting ad spend or creating localized landing pages—to maximize regional results.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to add any extra tracking scripts to see state and city data?**

No. If Sites Analytics is already capturing page views, Geographic Analytics will automatically populate.

**Q: Is the heat-map data available in real time?**

Visitor counts update as new sessions are recorded, so the map refreshes automatically without a full page reload.

**Q: Does this include both Funnels and Websites?**

The view follows your Analytics context (e.g., Funnels, Websites, or Both) and date range, so results reflect the scope you select on the Analytics page.
