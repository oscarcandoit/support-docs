# **What is Human Handover in Conversation AI?**

Human Handover is an advanced feature within HighLevel’s Conversation AI that automatically transfers conversations from the AI bot to a human team member when certain conditions are met. This ensures that customers receive personalized support whenever the AI reaches its limitations, such as when facing complex queries, repeated misunderstandings, or direct requests to speak with a human.

By leveraging Human Handover, businesses can prevent customer frustration, resolve issues more efficiently, and maintain a seamless conversational flow between automation and live support.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Human Handover**

Unlocking Human Handover in your workflow delivers tangible improvements to both customer experience and operational efficiency:

- **Eliminates Dead Ends:** Customers are never left without support, even if the bot can’t resolve their issue.

- **Smart Escalation:** Automatically detects when the AI is stuck, fails repeatedly, or receives a direct human request.

- **Seamless Transition:** Assigns a team member, creates a follow-up task, sends a closing message, and pauses the bot—all in one flow.

- **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Builds trust by ensuring real people are available when needed.

- **Efficient Team Notification:** Notifies staff instantly about handovers and new tasks, reducing response times.

- **Customizable Triggers & Actions:** Tailor when and how handovers happen to fit your business needs.
