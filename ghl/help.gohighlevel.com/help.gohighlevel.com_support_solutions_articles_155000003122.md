# **What is a Countdown Timer?**

Countdown timers visually track the remaining time until a specific event or deadline. In HighLevel, these timers can be reused across sites, styled to match your brand, and configured to behave in different ways depending on your goals. You can use them to drive urgency during launches, offer expiration notices, or event registrations.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Countdown Timers**

- **Urgency and scarcity**: Display real-time countdowns to drive immediate action.

- **Multiple timer types**: Fixed, Recurring, and Dynamic timers support a range of campaign styles.

- **Reusable design**: Use timers across multiple pages and funnels without rebuilding.

- **Styling control**: Adjust font, size, color, and visible time units to match your brand.
