## **How to prepare your video to allow Progress tracking via Workflow?**

1\. A video needs to be encoded for it to [show up in the filters](https://www.loom.com/share/a8bf99ab64e64a7ca11814dd81e56e5f?t=58) for a Video Tracking Workflow Trigger.

2\. We recommend turning off [Show Progress Bar](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001224428-hosted-video-player-for-funnels#:~:text=Full%20Screen%20Toggle%3A-,Show%20Progress%20Bar%3A,-Redirect%20Unregistered%20Visitors) in the Video Element settings so viewers cannot move back and forwards in a video, to assure accurate progress tracking.

3\. You are also recommended to set up a [Redirect for Unregistered Visitors.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001224428-hosted-video-player-for-funnels#:~:text=Redirect%20Unregistered%20Visitors%3A)

**Please Note:**

```
The accuracy of the video tracking depends on whether or not you have turned off the progress bar. Keeping it toggled on would interfere with the accuracy of the workflow's video tracking.
