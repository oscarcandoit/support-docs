## **Overview**

The **Additional Assets** section appears in the campaign creation/edit screen at the campaign level and supports the following:

- **Business Logos** for brand consistency

- **Image Assets** to make ads more visually engaging

- **Call Extensions** so customers can directly call your business

- **Sitelinks** to drive traffic to specific website pages


These assets provide richer formats for Google Ads and improve performance across Search, Display, and YouTube placements.

* * *

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1\. Add Business Logo**

- Navigate to the **Additional Assets** section while setting up a Google campaign.

- Click **Upload Logo**.

- Choose an existing image or upload a new one from the media library.

- Only **1:1 (square)** images are eligible.

- Once uploaded, click the logo to open editing options like cropping.

- Save your selection — this logo will appear across placements.


* * *

### **2\. Add Image Assets**

- In the **Additional Assets** section, click **Upload Images**.

- Choose one or more images from the media library or upload new files.

- You can add up to **20 images per campaign**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054098278/original/IARGj55HI9W2A09c4gdxTMwRyK-5gSWrWA.png?1758256507)


**Supported Guidelines:**

- Formats: **JPG, PNG**

- Aspect Ratios: **1:1 (square)** and **1.91:1 (landscape)**

- File Size: **Up to 5 MB per image**

- Recommended: Add at least **2–3 images per aspect ratio** for better coverage.


**Important Notes:**

- Avoid low-quality visuals, gifs, overlays, or misleading content.

- Uploading unsupported ratios (e.g., **4:5**) will trigger a **warning message** prompting you to crop/resize.

- If some images fail, your campaign will still publish with valid text ads and other assets.


* * *

### **3\. Configure Call Extensions**

- Click on the **Call Extensions** dropdown.

- Choose one or more previously added phone numbers.

2. Enter the phone number and choose a Conversion Action Category (e.g., Calls from Ads).

2. Fill in:

   - **Sitelink Text** (max 25 characters)

   - Optional **Description Line 1 & 2**

   - **Final URL**
3. Click **Create**.


Google recommends at least 4 sitelinks for best delivery.

* * *

## **Fallback Logic**

If no assets are added at the campaign level:

- The system will default to **account-level assets** (if available).

- If neither is present, the ad may run without these enhancements.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

**1\. What happens if I upload a non-square logo?**

Only 1:1 (square) images are eligible. Non-square logos will be discarded. Use the built-in cropping tool to adjust.

**2\. Can I add multiple phone numbers as call extensions?**

Yes. You can assign multiple approved numbers. Google will rotate them based on location, device, and availability.

**3\. Why is my call extension marked "Disapproved"?**

Call extensions must meet Google Ads policies. Disapproval reasons include invalid/unverified numbers, country code mismatches, or formatting issues.

**4\. How many site links can I add?**

You can add **2–20 site links**, but **4** is recommended for optimal performance.

**5\. Can I edit an existing site link or phone number?**

Yes. Use the pencil/edit icon next to the entry to update it.

**6\. What are the benefits of campaign-level assets?**

- Saves time by applying assets across all ad groups and ads.

- Maintains brand consistency.

- Ensures rich ad formats (logos, images, site links, calls) are always included.


**7\. Will these settings override account-level assets?**

Yes. Campaign-level selections take precedence. If absent, account-level assets are used.

**8\. What happens if I upload images in an unsupported ratio (e.g., 4:5)?**

Unsupported ratios will trigger a **warning message**. The system will prompt you to crop or resize the image to either **1:1** or **1.91:1**. The rejected image will not be published.

**9\. Do failed image uploads stop my campaign from publishing?**

No. Even if individual images fail, your campaign will still publish with valid text ads and other approved assets.

In Ad Manager, users can now configure **Business Logos**, **Call Extensions**, and **Sitelinks** at the **Campaign Level** for Google Ads. These assets will automatically apply across all Ad Groups and Ads under the campaign, ensuring consistency and reducing redundant setup.
