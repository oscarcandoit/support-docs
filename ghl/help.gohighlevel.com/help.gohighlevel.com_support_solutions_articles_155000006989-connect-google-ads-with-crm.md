# Connect Google ads with CRM

Modified on: Wed, 19 Nov, 2025 at 11:14 PM

The Google Ads integration allows you to collect leads directly from Google Ads and have them automatically synced with your CRM. With this integration, you can easily capture contact information from potential customers interested in your products or services on Google and quickly follow up with them through your CRM. By automating the lead capture process, you can save time and improve the efficiency of your sales and marketing efforts.

Step 4: Once connected, all lead forms linked to your selected ad accounts will appear — along with their associated campaign names and status.

Step 5: Set up workflows using the trigger “Google Lead Form Submitted” to automate your follow-up actions when a new lead comes in.

## Form Field Mapping:

- Click on Play/Edit icon for the form you wish to map and sync leads from.

- Use the Map Fields button to align your Google ad form fields with CRM fields.

- If you want to disable inbound leads from any of the forms, Click on Pause icon.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058804486/original/OXvvN8QkpHUo2mE0boToMmDvfTysGdFVdg.jpeg?1763615672)
