# What is WhatsAppV2 Action?

WhatsAppV2 Action is the next-gen automation tool for sending and managing WhatsApp messages inside workflows. Unlike the older WhatsAppV1, this new version adds smart branching, timeout-based responses, media control, and reply-driven logic—enabling users to create dynamic, high-conversion chat flows with ease.

Key Benefits of WhatsAppV2 Actions

WhatsAppV2 introduces smarter automation and tighter control over your customer conversations.

- ? Smart Branching – Automatically create logic branches based on quick reply button responses.

- ? Media Flexibility – Easily change PDF, video, or image URLs directly in the action setup.

- ✉️ Versatile Messaging – Choose from free-form messages, templates, or WhatsApp Flows.

- ? Branch Toggle – Keep workflows simple by disabling reply-based branches when not needed.

- ⏳ Timeout Actions – Define what happens if the user doesn’t respond in time.

- ⏸ Wait-for-Reply Logic – Pause the workflow until a reply is received (only after delivery).

- ? Auto Deliverability Handling – No need to use if conditions for delivery tracking—V2 does it for you.


## How To Use WhatsAppV2 in a Workflow

Build intelligent WhatsApp journeys with just a few clicks.

1. Create a WhatsApp Template





   - Use the Messaging > Templates area to build or select a template.

   - Add buttons, media, or Meta Flows based on your goal.
2. Add WhatsAppV2 to Your Workflow





   - From the workflow builder, add the WhatsAppV2 Action.

   - Choose your message type: template, free-form, or flow-enabled.
3. Configure Smart Logic





   - Select reply buttons (if any) to auto-generate branches.

   - Add timeout duration and fallback paths.

   - Enable or disable wait-for-reply options.
4. Monitor Logs





   - View logs to see which path each contact takes (e.g., delivered, replied, timeout).

## Smart Branching Based on Button Replies

Let the system do the heavy lifting.

When your WhatsApp template includes reply buttons, WhatsAppV2 automatically creates workflow branches for each response. No need to manually build conditions or filters.

## Timeout & Wait-For-Reply Logic

React to silence or replies with precision.

- Timeout: Trigger a follow-up or fallback action after a set period of no response.

- Wait-for-Reply: Pause the workflow entirely until the user responds (useful for high-engagement flows).


## Editing Media on the Fly

Change your media links without rebuilding templates.

WhatsAppV2 allows you to modify the URLs for images, PDFs, and videos inside the message configuration—even if they’re part of an approved template. This makes it easier to reuse and customize templates without extra approval steps.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What happens if a message isn’t delivered?

WhatsAppV2 tracks delivery and routes users down the appropriate branch (no manual setup required).

Q: Can I use both V1 and V2 in the same workflow?

We recommend using WhatsAppV2 exclusively in new workflows for maximum flexibility.

Q: Do I need Meta Flow setup to use templates?

Only if your template includes a flow. You can also send basic templates or free-form messages.

Q: How do I disable smart branching?

Turn off the Branch Replies toggle in the action settings to use WhatsAppV2 like a basic notifier.

### Next Steps

- Try building a WhatsAppV2-powered workflow with buttons and timeout logic.

- Use logs to analyze message performance and optimize follow-ups.

- Convert older workflows to WhatsAppV2 for a more responsive customer experience.
