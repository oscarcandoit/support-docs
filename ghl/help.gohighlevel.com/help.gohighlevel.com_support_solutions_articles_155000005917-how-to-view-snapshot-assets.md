# **What is Snapshot Asset Viewer?**

Snapshot Asset Viewer lets you open any snapshot from the **Account Snapshots** page and immediately see a structured list of every asset it contains. By being able to view snapshot contents up front, the viewer eliminates guesswork and prevents surprise overwrites when you load, refresh, or share snapshots.

Understanding a snapshot’s contents before loading or sharing prevents accidental overwrites and incomplete migrations. The Viewer brings that insight forward, eliminating the need to download or load a snapshot just to see what’s inside.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Snapshot Asset Viewer**

- **Enhanced Transparency:** Instantly audit all assets before loading or sharing a snapshot.

- **Improved Efficiency:** Search by keyword to locate specific assets without manual scrolling.

- **Error Prevention:** Verify contents to avoid overwriting the wrong funnels, emails, or automations.

- **Streamlined Management**: verify contents before loading, sharing, or refreshing, reducing costly mistakes.

- **Faster Troubleshooting:** Identify missing components when a snapshot fails to behave as expected.

- **Audit Readiness**: keep a clear inventory of assets for compliance or internal reviews.


* * *

## **Viewing Assets**

A clear asset list ensures you know exactly what you are working with before you import or refresh.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Account Snapshots**.

2. Choose **My Snapshots**, **Shared Snapshots**, or **Imported Snapshots**.

3. Click any snapshot’s name and instantly view all assets without additional navigation.
