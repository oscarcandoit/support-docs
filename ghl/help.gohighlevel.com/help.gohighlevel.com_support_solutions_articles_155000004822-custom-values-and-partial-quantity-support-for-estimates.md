## **How to Use Custom Values in Estimates**

Business users can leverage custom values at two levels:

**1\. Editor Level Configuration**

This option allows users to adjust custom values directly while editing an estimate. To set a custom value in the editor:

1. Navigate to the **Estimates** section in your dashboard.

2. Open an existing estimate or create a new one.

3. Locate the **Custom Values** field and enter the required information.

4. Save and send the estimate to the customer.


**2\. Settings Level Configuration**

For consistent application of custom values across all estimates, predefined values can be configured at the settings level:

1. Go to **Settings** in the admin panel.

2. Select **Estimates Preferences**.

3. Define your custom values and save them.

4. These values will now be automatically available when creating estimates.


## **How to Enable Partial Quantity Support in Estimates**

Business users can configure partial quantities for items within estimates to accommodate services or products measured in fractions.

**Steps to Enable Partial Quantities**:

1. Open the **Estimates** module.

2. Select an existing estimate or create a new one.

3. When adding items, enter a fractional value in the quantity field (e.g., 1.5 hours, 0.25 units).

4. The system will automatically calculate the pricing based on the entered fractional quantity.

5. Save and send the estimate.


This feature is ideal for businesses offering time-based services, construction materials, or any item that does not require whole number quantities.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use both editor-level and settings-level custom values in the same estimate?** Yes, you can manually adjust custom values at the editor level while still having predefined values set at the settings level.

**Q: Will enabling partial quantities affect pricing calculations?** No, the system automatically calculates prices based on fractional quantities entered, ensuring accurate estimates.

**Q: Can the Order Submitted Trigger send notifications to multiple teams?** Yes, you can configure multiple actions, including sending notifications to different teams or updating CRM data.

**Q: Is autopayment supported with PayPal for recurring invoices?** No, PayPal is only available for recurring invoices when autopayment is disabled.
