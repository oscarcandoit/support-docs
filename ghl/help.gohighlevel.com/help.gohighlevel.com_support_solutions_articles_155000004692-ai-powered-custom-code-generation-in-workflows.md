# **What is AI-Powered Code Generation in Workflows?**

Writing custom code in workflows just became smarter, faster, and easier with **Code with AI (Beta)**. This new feature enables users to generate JavaScript code snippets by simply describing their desired functionality in plain language, reducing the need for manual coding and debugging.

## **Key Benefits of AI-Powered Code Generation**

Leveraging AI for code generation enhances productivity and minimizes the technical barrier for users. Key advantages include:

- **AI-Powered Code Generation**– Simply describe what you need, and AI generates the corresponding JavaScript code.

- **Automated Property Integration**– AI automatically maps input properties from previous workflow steps.

- **One-Click Implementation**– Quickly review and insert AI-generated code into your workflow.

- **Easy Regeneration**– Need a different version? Click Generate again for an updated snippet.

- **Enhanced Efficiency**– Reduce the time and technical expertise required for custom coding.


## **How to Use Code with AI**

Follow these steps to generate and implement custom code seamlessly within your workflows:

1. **Select Custom Code Action**– Choose the Custom Code action within your workflow.

5. **Review and Implement**– Examine the output and click **Use Code** to insert it into your workflow.


> **Pro Tip:** The more specific your prompt, the better the AI-generated code will be!

## **Example Use Cases**

Here are some practical ways to leverage AI-powered code generation in your workflows:

- **Data Formatting**– Convert phone numbers or dates into a standardized format.

- **API Integration**– Generate code to fetch data from external services via HTTP requests.

- **Mathematical Calculations**– Perform real-time calculations such as interest rates or discounts.

- **String Manipulation**– Extract key details from text, such as pulling email addresses from subject lines.

- **Conditional Logic**– Implement custom decision-making processes, such as routing leads based on specific criteria.
