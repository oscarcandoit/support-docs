# **What is the Pricing Table element?**

The Pricing Table element lets you present one or more plans in a clean, comparable layout. It supports multiple display modes (grid, carousel, classic table, comparison table), several pricing models, and configurable actions so you can tailor the experience to your offer, page design, and audience.

- **Where it’s available:** Funnels, Websites, Blogs, and the E‑Commerce Store builders in HighLevel.

## **Key Benefits of Pricing Table element**

Understanding core benefits makes it easier to decide when and how to use the element for maximum impact on conversions and clarity.

- **Layout flexibility:** Choose Grid, Carousel, Classic Table, or Comparison Table to match your content and page goal.

- **Clear plan comparison:** Use horizontal scrolling, arrows, and sticky head column (Comparison mode) to keep features readable.

- **Multiple pricing models:** Communicate one‑time, recurring, tiered, or variable pricing without workarounds.

- **Conversion cues:** Add previous price (strikethrough), discount badges, and captions that highlight offers.

- **Action control:** Point buttons to URLs, open popups, jump to sections, download files, or have no action.

- **Brand consistency:** Customize colors, spacing, and column gaps to blend with your site design.

## **Dynamic Layout Modes**

Selecting the right layout helps visitors understand differences between plans and speeds up decision‑making.

| **Carousel Mode** | Slide-based presentation with optional auto-advance. | **Columns per slide:** 1–5. | Auto-advance interval; pause on hover; infinite loop. | **Fade** or **Slide** animation. |
| **Classic Table Mode** | Traditional table for wide, detailed comparisons. | Uses horizontal width; ideal for long feature lists. | **Horizontal scroll with arrow controls.** | — |
| **Comparison Table Mode** | Deep, column-heavy comparisons where context matters. | Wide tables; **sticky head column** remains visible. | **Horizontal scroll with arrow controls;** sticky head column for context. | — |

**Tips**
