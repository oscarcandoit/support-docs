# **What is CSV Blog Importer?**

The CSV Blog Importer is a bulk-upload tool inside HighLevel Blogs that converts properly-formatted CSV or Excel files into publish-ready blog posts. By validating headers, auto-matching authors and categories, and walking you through a three-stage review flow, it removes almost all manual copy-and-paste work.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of CSV Blog Importer**

- **Seamless Migration:** Eliminate the hassle of copying content manually from external platforms.

- **Bulk Importing:** Upload up to 60 posts in a single file to speed up onboarding.

- **Smart Organization:** Automatically create or match authors and categories to minimize manual cleanup.

- **Flexible Scheduling:** HighLevel interprets the Publish Date automatically from the uploaded file.

- **Built-in SEO Preview:** View titles, meta descriptions, and social images before publishing.

- **Error Free Setup:** Use the downloadable sample CSV to prevent header or format mistakes.

- **Instant Validation:** Inline error messages highlight missing or incorrect data right away.

* * *

## **Important Notes**

- **Automatic Validation:** HighLevel scans your CSV headers on upload and flags missing or misspelled fields for quick correction.

- **Required Fields:** All required headers must be present, though individual cell values can remain blank.

- **Error Detection:** Inline error chips highlight issues such as missing images, invalid dates, or long meta descriptions.

- **Smart Scheduling:** Past dates = **Published/** Future dates = **Scheduled/** Blank dates = **Draft**.

- **File Size:** Keep your file **under** **25** **MB** to avoid browser time-outs; split larger files into smaller batches.

- **CSV Formatting:** Incorrectly formatted files display **inline** **error** **messages** until corrected.

- **Time Zone Handling:** The importer respects each sub-account’s time zone to ensure posts publish at the correct local time.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the maximum number of posts I can import at once?** Up to 60 posts per CSV/XLSX file.

**Q: Does the importer download and host my images?** Yes. Provide either full image URLs or relative paths accessible to the public internet; HighLevel will fetch and store them.

**Q: Can I edit posts after importing?** Absolutely. Imported posts act like any other blog post—open the editor, adjust content, and republish.

**Q: What happens if I re-import a post with the same title?** A new draft will be created; duplicates are not automatically merged.

**Q: Is there a file-size limit?** Keep the file under 25 MB to avoid browser time-outs. Split larger files into smaller batches for best performance.

**Q: Will unpublished drafts count toward the 60-post limit?** Yes, all rows in your CSV count toward the 60-row cap, regardless of their final status.

**Q: Can I undo an import?** There’s no one-click rollback. Delete imported posts manually or use bulk-delete from the Blog Posts list.

**Q: What happens if I don’t include an existing author or category in my CSV?** The system will auto-create them during the import process.

**Q: What happens if I leave the publish date blank?** The post will be imported as a Draft.

**Q: Can I re-upload a CSV if there are errors?** Yes, you can fix the errors in your file and re-upload anytime.

**Q: What platforms can I migrate from?** Any platform that allows you to export structured content into CSV or Excel (e.g., Blogger, Wix, WordPress, etc.).
