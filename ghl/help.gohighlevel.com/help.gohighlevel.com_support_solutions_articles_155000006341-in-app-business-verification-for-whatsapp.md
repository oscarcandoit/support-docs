# **What is WhatsApp Business Verification?**

WhatsApp Business Verification is Meta’s process to confirm that your business is legitimate and matches official records. Approval links your legal entity to your WhatsApp Business account, enabling higher messaging limits and improving account standing

With HighLevel’s In‑App Business Verification for WhatsApp, you complete the same verification without leaving the app! You upload the required documents and submit your verification request securely to Meta without leaving HighLevel. This expedites the verification process and removes the need to submit through Meta Business Maanger.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How long does verification take?**

Review time varies by Meta’s queue and document quality. You’ll see live status in HighLevel and can act immediately on rejections.

**What’s the difference between Business Verification and WhatsApp phone number verification?**

Business Verification confirms your legal entity with Meta using business documents. Approval unlocks higher messaging limits and lets you register more numbers. Phone number verification (OTP) proves you own a specific phone number so it can connect to the WhatsApp Business Platform. You need both steps: complete OTP for each number you add, and complete Business Verification in HighLevel to raise limits and scale (OTP alone does not increase limits, and Business Verification does not replace OTP).

**Q: Is there a cost for verification through HighLevel?**

There is no separate verification fee from HighLevel. Messaging fees and conversation charges still apply per WhatsApp policies.

**Q: Can I keep sending messages while verification is in progress or if it’s rejected?**

Yes, you can continue within your current limits. If rejected, fix the issue and re‑submit to unlock higher limits.
