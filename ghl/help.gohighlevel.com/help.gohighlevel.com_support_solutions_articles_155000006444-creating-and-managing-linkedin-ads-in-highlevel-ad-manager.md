### **Pre-requisites**

Before connecting, confirm that:

  - Campaign Manager access to the Ad Account.
  - Admin access to the LinkedIn Company Page.

### **Steps to Connect Your LinkedIn Ad Account**

**Open Ad Manager Settings**

To begin, navigate to **Marketing › Ad Manager**, then click the **Settings gear icon** in the top right corner of the dashboard.

This opens the Ad Manager Settings page where you can configure or connect ad accounts across supported platforms like Meta, Google, and LinkedIn.

## **Campaign Structure in LinkedIn**

LinkedIn uses a three-tier campaign hierarchy that HighLevel mirrors inside Ad Manager. Understanding this structure helps organize campaigns efficiently for tracking and budgeting.

- **Campaign Group** – Top-level budget container.

- **Campaign** – Objective, targeting, and spend layer.

- **Ad** – Creative assets and copy.

Multiple campaigns can exist within one group, and each campaign can include multiple ads for A/B testing.

## **Supported Campaign Objectives**

Choosing the correct campaign objective ensures that LinkedIn optimizes delivery based on your marketing goal.

| **Objective** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| Lead Generation | Capture qualified B2B leads through LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms that automatically sync with HighLevel. |
| Website Traffic | Drive verified clicks to your website and validate landing pages before publishing. |
