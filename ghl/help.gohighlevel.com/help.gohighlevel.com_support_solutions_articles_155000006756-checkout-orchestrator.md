# Checkout Orchestrator

Modified on: Tue, 21 Oct, 2025 at 7:35 PM

Meet the new Checkout Orchestrator for Membership Courses—a lightning-fast, self-healing checkout engine that eliminates duplicate orders, slashes wait-times, and gives you real-time insight into every purchase. Get paid faster while your students enjoy instant access to their content.

* * *

## **What is the Checkout Orchestrator for Membership Courses?**

The Checkout Orchestrator is HighLevel’s **rebuilt checkout pipeline** for Membership Courses. **Behind the scenes** it coordinates every payment, access-grant, and notification step in an optimized hybrid sequence/parallel flow, resulting in a dramatically faster, more transparent, and fully fault-tolerant purchase experience.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Checkout Orchestrator**

Delivering value the moment your customer hits “Pay”:

• ~70 % faster average checkout— **3-4 seconds** instead of 8-12 seconds

• 100 % success rate at scale thanks to **automatic duplicate prevention**

• **Self-healing retries** (up to five times) that resume exactly where a failure occurred

• Live step-by-step traces for **instant support troubleshooting**

• Fully backward-compatible— **no edits required to existing offers or funnels**

* * *

## **Experience the Checkout Orchestrator**

The upgrade is automatically enabled on all locations that use Membership Offers checkout. Follow these best-practice steps to confirm everything is running smoothly:

- Navigate to Sites → Memberships → Offers and choose an existing offer.

- Click Checkout → Preview Checkout and place a $0 test order to observe the 3-4 second flow.

- Open Sites → Memberships → Checkouts → Activity Log to verify each step shows “Success.”

- (Optional) Enable Developer Mode in the Activity Log to view payloads and error-handling retries.

- Repeat the test during peak traffic (e.g., launch day) to watch automatic scaling in action.

```
No configuration is required. Your funnels, forms, Smart Lists, and client portal continue to work as before.
```

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q : Do I need to update my existing membership offers or checkout pages?**

A : No. The orchestrator is backward-compatible; your current pages automatically use the new flow.

**Q : Where can I find checkout error logs?**

A : Go to Sites → Memberships → Checkouts → Activity Log and click any failed step to see full error context.

**Q : How many retry attempts does the orchestrator make?**

A : Up to five automatic retries with exponential back-off.

**Q : Will customers ever be charged twice if a retry occurs?**

A : No. Duplicate-prevention tokens ensure a contact can only be charged once per order.

**Q : Does this affect one-click upsells in Memberships?**

A : One-click upsells continue to work and now inherit faster processing times.
