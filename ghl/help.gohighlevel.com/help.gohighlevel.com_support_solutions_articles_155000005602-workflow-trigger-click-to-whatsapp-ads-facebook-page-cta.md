## **What is the WhatsApp Workflow Trigger: Click‑to‑WhatsApp Ads & Facebook Page CTA?**

The WhatsApp Workflow Trigger automatically fires a workflow the instant someone reaches out via a Meta Click‑to‑WhatsApp ad or the WhatsApp button on your Facebook Page.

When a prospect taps your ad or page call‑to‑action, HighLevel receives the incoming WhatsApp message, opens a conversation, and launches any workflow you’ve attached to this trigger—no manual monitoring required. By meeting prospects while intent is high, you shorten the sales cycle and boost the return on every ad dollar.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of WhatsApp Workflow Trigger**

The trigger’s biggest value lies in speed and scale. Instead of waiting for a human reply, every lead receives the right response right away, keeping your brand top‑of‑mind and conversation costs under control.

- **Instant Lead Engagement:** Prospects get an immediate reply, increasing the likelihood they stay in the chat.

- **Cost‑Efficient Messaging:** 72 hours of free messaging (both free‑form and template) unlock when you respond within 24 hours, saving budget on follow‑up.

- **Seamless Follow‑Up:** Automatically tag, assign, and nurture leads with smart workflow actions—no manual tasks slipping through the cracks.

* * *

## **Click‑to‑WhatsApp Ads / Page CTA Trigger**

This sub‑feature is the heartbeat of the trigger, detecting every inbound message that originates from a Meta Click‑to‑WhatsApp ad or your Facebook Page’s WhatsApp button.

- Launches the workflow the moment the WhatsApp message arrives.

- Maintains context by passing Ad ID & Campaign names into custom fields.

- Bridges the gap between ad engagement and personalized messaging so you never miss a warm lead.

* * *

## **Filter by Ad or Post (Action Filter)**

Filters let you fine‑tune which ad interactions should (or should not) fire your automation, giving you granular control over campaign‑specific workflows.

- **Ad ID / Post ID / URL Filters:** Restrict the trigger to one specific promotion.

- **Headline & Source‑Type Filters:** Further narrow activations by ad headline or Meta surface.

- Segment messaging paths based on campaign goals without cloning entire workflows.


* * *

## **How To Set Up WhatsApp Workflow Trigger**

Proper configuration is critical—one missed filter can prevent a workflow from firing. Follow these steps for a rock‑solid setup. This workflow trigger activates **when a customer using an Android or iOS device messages you via**:

- A **Click-to-WhatsApp Ad**

- A **Facebook Page Call-to-Action (CTA) button**


This interaction opens a **free entry-point conversation** as long as you respond within **24 hours**.

### **Step 1:** Go to Automation > Add new Trigger > Click to WhatsApp Ads

Click **Add New Trigger** and select **Click‑to‑WhatsApp Ads**.

### **Step 2:** Add filters > Ad / Post Id > Ad / Post URL

Apply **Ad ID, Post ID, URL, Headline, or Source‑Type** filters to limit which campaigns activate the workflow.

```
Please Note: Add desired workflow actions, e.g., Send WhatsApp Message, Assign to Pipeline Stage, Add Tag, or Webhook. Now you can save the workflow and get started.

## **What are Free Entry Point Messaging**

A free entry point conversation is opened if (1) a customer using a device running Android or iOS messages you via a [Click to WhatsApp Ad](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/447934475640650?id=371525583593535) or [Facebook Page Call-to-Action button](https://www.facebook.com/help/977869848936797) and (2) you respond within 24 hours. Suppose you do not respond within 24 hours. In that case, a free entry point conversation is not opened and you must use a template to message the customer, which opens a marketing, utility, or authentication conversation, per the category of the template.

The free entry point conversation is opened as soon as your message is delivered and lasts 72 hours. When a free entry point conversation is opened, it automatically closes all other open conversations between you and the customer, and no new conversations will be opened until the free entry point conversation expires.

Once the free entry point conversation is opened, you can send any type of message to the customer without incurring additional charges. However, you can only send non-template messages if there is an open customer service window between you and the customer.

**For example**, if the customer messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad at 10 am and you respond via a template message at 10pm the same day:

- The free entry point conversation starts at 10 pm and lasts 72 hours.

- You can send template messages at no charge in those 72 hours.

- You can send non-template messages until 10 am the next day, at which point the [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages#customer-service-windows) closes, as it is independent of the free entry point conversation (if the customer messages you again, however, it opens another 24-hour customer service window in which you can send any type of message).
