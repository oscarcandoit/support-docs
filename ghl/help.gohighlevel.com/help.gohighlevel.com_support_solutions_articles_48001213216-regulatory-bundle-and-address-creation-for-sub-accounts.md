# **What is a Regulatory Bundle?**

Regulatory Bundles are required by telecom carriers to verify the identity and location of businesses or individuals purchasing phone numbers in certain countries. These bundles include documentation such as government-issued ID, utility bills, or business registration details, and help ensure legal compliance with local number ownership laws.

Without a regulatory bundle, phone numbers in regulated regions cannot be activated. LC Phone users can manage this process directly within the HighLevel platform.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Regulatory Bundles**

Submitting a regulatory bundle is essential for purchasing international phone numbers in compliance with regional laws. This process ensures verified identity, prevents telecom issues, and simplifies global number management across your agency.

- **Compliance with Local Telecom Regulations:** Meets legal requirements in regulated countries to activate and maintain phone numbers.

- **Improved Deliverability and Service Quality:** Verified bundles reduce the risk of carrier filtering, suspension, or number removal.

- **In-App Management:** Allows regulatory bundles to be created and submitted directly inside HighLevel — no need to leave the platform.

- **Faster Setup with Built-In Compliance Tab:** For LC Phone users, the Compliance tab streamlines document upload and address validation.

A regulatory bundle is a set of documents used to verify the identity and location of a person or business. It's required to purchase phone numbers in countries with telecom regulations, ensuring legal use and compliance.
