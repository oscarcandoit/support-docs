# **What is Community Affiliates?**

Community Affiliates enables an internal referral program for GoKollab communities. When activated, paid members receive personal invite links. When an invitee joins and pays for membership, the referrer earns a commission based on the percentage set by the community owner. This aligns incentives so growth comes from authentic member advocacy.

Community Affiliates is available exclusively on GoKollab and is designed to keep setup simple while giving owners clear control over commissions and payouts.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Community Affiliates**

Knowing the core advantages helps you position the program to your team and members, ensuring everyone understands how referrals convert into revenue and rewards.

- **Word‑of‑mouth growth:** Recommendations from trusted members lead to higher‑quality sign‑ups.

- **Lower acquisition costs:** Shift spend from ads to performance‑based commissions you control.

- **Member loyalty:** Reward engaged advocates for contributing to community growth.

- **Owner control:** Set the commission %, monitor results, and manage payouts yourself.

- **Clear attribution:** Personal invite links attribute paid joins to the correct referrer.


* * *

## **Member Referral Commissions**

Clear rules around when commissions are created reduce disputes and make the program easier to administer.

- Commissions are credited when a new member uses a referrer’s invite link **and completes a paid membership**.

- The **commission %** is defined by the community owner and applies to eligible referrals.

- Earnings accumulate and are paid when the owner processes payouts.


* * *

## **Auto‑Generated Referral Links**

Easy‑to‑use invite links encourage participation. Make sure members know where to find their link and how referrals are tracked.

- Each **paid** member can access a unique invite link for your community.

- Members can copy and share their link across social channels, email, or direct messages.

- Announce the program with a pinned post and onboarding email to drive early momentum.


* * *

## **Commission Settings & Payout Ownership**

Owners define the incentive structure and retain full control of payout timing and method, ensuring flexibility for different business processes.

- **Commission %:** Owners set the global commission percentage for referrals that convert to paid memberships.

- **Payouts owned by you:** Payouts are **managed directly by community owners, not by Kollab**. Choose how and when to pay (e.g., bank transfer) based on your internal processes.

- **Status updates:** Owners manually mark payouts as **Completed** or **Failed** so referrers see accurate status in their dashboards.
