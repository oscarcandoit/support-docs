# **Overview of Creating a Booking**

The **Create Booking** flow allows admins to manually create bookings for customers directly from the Appointments or Calendar view. Admin-created bookings provide **complete flexibility** — enabling bookings outside configured business or listing constraints.

This means you can:

- Create bookings **outside business operating hours.**

- Set **any start and end time**, even if the time selector is disabled.

- Create bookings for **any duration**, regardless of fixed durations defined on listings.

- Bypass minimum and maximum booking durations, minimum scheduling notice, and maximum advance window.

- Still respect **pre-buffer** and **post-buffer** time slots when checking availability.


**Example:** If a listing’s default rental time is 9 AM–11 PM and the time selector is disabled, you can still create a booking from 7 AM–1 PM. Similarly, if fixed durations are 4 hours or 1 day, you can still book it for 2 hours or 2 days manually.

This gives admins flexibility for exceptions while maintaining operational safety.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Creating a Booking**

- **Speed to Schedule:** Create directly from Appointments or Calendar to handle requests quickly.

- **Flexible:** Admins can set custom start/end even when listings use fixed durations or disabled time selectors.

- **Protection Against Conflicts:** Buffers and inventory are always enforced to prevent overbooking.

- **Accurate Pricing & Deposits:** Payment Summary reflects configured pricing rules and any security deposit so totals are clear before saving.

- **Multi‑Listing Support:** Add multiple listings—each with its own times and quantities—in a single booking to streamline complex orders.

- **Immediate Team Visibility:** Saved bookings appear right away in Appointments and Calendar for operational coordination.


* * *

## **How to Create a New Booking?**

## **Sections of the Create Booking Form**

The booking form includes the following sections:

1. **Customer Information**

2. **Listings**

3. **Payment Summary**

4. **Internal Note**

5. **Set Payment Status**


Each section is detailed below.

* * *

## **Customer Information**

Enter or select the customer making the booking.

**Fields:**

- Select Contact – Search existing contacts or create a new one




  - If no record exists, click **Add New Contact** to create one instantly.
- Phone & Email– Automatically fetched from the selected contact.

```
Tip: Always confirm contact details to ensure reminders and payment confirmations reach the right person.
```

* * *

## **Listings Section**

This is where you select the listing(s) being booked.

#### **Steps to Add a Listing:**

1. Choose the **Listing Name** from the dropdown.

2. Select a **Variant** (if applicable).

3. Enter the **Quantity** – The number of units being booked.

4. Define **Start and End Date/Time.**





   - The time picker appears even if the listing’s time selector is disabled.

   - You can choose custom times and durations beyond fixed durations or rental hours.

   - While updating or adding new listings to the booking, inventory must be available for the time duration for it to be selectable.

   - The Duration auto-calculates based on your selection but can be manually adjusted.
5. The **Listing Total** updates automatically with pricing rules and discounts.

6. The **Security Deposit** updates automatically if applicable.


```
Important: Manual bookings ignore minimum/maximum durations, scheduling notice, and booking windows, but respect buffer times so existing reservations aren’t overlapped.
```

- The combined total updates in the final **Payment Summary**.

## **Payment Summary**

The payment summary consolidates all costs in the booking.

**Displayed Fields:**

- **Subtotal** – Total of all listings added.

- **Security Deposit Total** – Combined refundable or authorized deposit (if applicable).

- **Total Amount** – The final total before collecting payment.


```
Note: Incase security deposit is set to Card on File, the Total Amount in the payment summary includes the amount for Security Deposit, however; it can be collected later and is not considered as an amount due until charged explicitly.
```

* * *

## **Internal Notes**

Use this section to add contextual notes or record operational details.

- **Add Internal Note:** Add instructions, customer requests, or internal reminders.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056087616/original/yE7it8m7nlORVyV7EPcD-Wa35Phkld_5Tg.png?1760549796)

* * *

## **Set Booking Status**

Before saving, you can choose the **initial status** for the booking:

- **Unconfirmed** – The booking is recorded but not yet confirmed; useful for tentative rentals.

- **Booked** – The booking is confirmed immediately


This flexibility helps admins manage provisional holds or manually confirmed bookings.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056087554/original/HF-gFQyknlDPM3UWR6IwlgxbrnnDnGyfUQ.png?1760549742)

* * *

## **Save and Confirm**

Once all fields are complete:

1. Review customer and listing details.

2. Click **Save Changes.**

3. The booking appears in the **Appointments List View**


**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056087649/original/e-B0GVPyyGHbMqbbAyy2jImm8TN3Tz3gmA.png?1760549856)**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I create a booking without taking payment right now?**

Yes. Save without payment, then open **Edit Booking** later to collect full balance or deposit.

**Q: Why isn’t the deposit appearing in Payment Summary?**

Check Global Settings to ensure deposits are enabled and that the variant’s deposit isn’t set to $0.

**Q: What happens if my time overlaps a buffer or inventory isn’t available?**

You’ll see an error or disabled save. Adjust times to respect buffers or reduce booking to available inventory.

**Q: How are multi‑listing bookings priced and shown?**

Each listing becomes a separate row with its own pricing and payment state; the booking may show Partially Paid until all rows are paid.
