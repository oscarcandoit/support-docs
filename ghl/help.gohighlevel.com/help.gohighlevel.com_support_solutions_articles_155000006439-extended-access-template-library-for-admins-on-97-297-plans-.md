# **What is Extended Template Library Admin Access?**

Template Library admin access was limited to $497 plan users. Now, admins on the $97 “Starter” and $297 “Unlimited” plans can log into Agency View → Template Library to explore ready-made assets, hide individual templates or entire categories, and preview premium creation tools with a gentle upgrade prompt.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Extended Template Library Access**

- Browse Templates - Admins on the $97 and $297 plans can now browse the Template Library.
- Hide Templates - Prevent specific templates from appearing in the Template Library for locations.
- Hide Categories - Prevent entire categories from appearing in the Template Library.

* * *

## **Hiding Individual Templates**

Hiding prevents a specific template from appearing anywhere in sub-accounts, safeguarding your agency’s brand or niche focus. Navigate to Agency → Template Library. Hover over a template and click Hide. A grey “Hidden” badge confirms the change.

```
Hidden templates remain visible to agency admins for future management.
```

* * *

## **Hiding Entire Categories**

Category-level hiding is perfect when none of the templates inside a folder fit your services. Inside Template Library, click the gear icon (Settings). Choose a product (e.g., Funnels) → Categories. Toggle Hide next to any category. All templates inside become invisible to every location.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can $97 & $297 admins create new templates?**

A: Not yet. Template creation still requires the $497 Pro plan, but you can browse and hide content today. (help.gohighlevel.com)

**Q: Do hidden templates disappear for existing locations?**

A: Yes. Once you hide a template or category, it is removed from every current and future sub-account automatically.

**Q: Will hiding a category also hide templates I’ve customised?**

A: If the customised template lives only in that hidden category, it will be hidden. Templates assigned to multiple visible categories will still show.

**Q: Can I unhide something later?**

A: Absolutely. Return to Settings → Categories or hover over the template and click Unhide. Changes take effect instantly.

**Q: Does hiding affect my agency’s ability to use the template?**

A: No. Hidden items stay visible to Agency Admins, so you can still duplicate or edit them internally.

**Q: Is there a bulk-hide option?**

A: Category hiding is the fastest bulk route. You can also multi-select templates inside a category and toggle Hide.

**Q: Will clients see HighLevel branding anywhere?**

A: Hidden templates eliminate HighLevel-branded assets from their view, preserving your whitelabel presence.

**Q: Can agency users (non-admin) access the library?**

A: Only Agency Admins have library permissions on $97 & $297 plans. Users and location roles cannot see or edit templates.
