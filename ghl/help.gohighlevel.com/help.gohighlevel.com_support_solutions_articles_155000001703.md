## Create Contactless Tasks

![ewdwedwedwedwed](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017999879/original/tasteVukbuygzDXJiAv8pY4ysWes8CqSbA.png?1705512168)

Create tasks on the task list page without a contact specifically for your team members. These tasks can be used to manage work and responsibilities within your team easily

## Filter Internal Tasks

![ewdwedwedwedwed](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017999902/original/l0cBkFjZyg-DLxPiwH71az2ISUUzZxalvQ.png?1705512178)

Utilize the "Unassigned" option in the "Contact" filter field to filter out contactless/internal tasks for your team.

## Assign, remove, or Reassign the Contact to a task

Along with creating contactless tasks, the contact can be added, removed, or reassigned anytime post a task is created giving you absolute control over managing the tasks in your subaccount

## ``` These tasks are also visible in the Tasks list on the Dashboard page. ```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I schedule tasks with dynamic dates or create them automatically based on triggers?**

While the Tasks section allows manual task creation for your team, **advanced task scheduling and automation—like setting dynamic due dates (e.g., “2 days from now at 5PM”)—must be configured via workflows**.

To do this, use the **“Add Task”** workflow action under **Automation > Workflows**. This gives you full control over assigning tasks and defining dynamic due times based on triggers like form submissions, opportunity updates, and more.
