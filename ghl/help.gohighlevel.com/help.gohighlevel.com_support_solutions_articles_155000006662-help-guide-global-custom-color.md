## **What Are Global Custom Colors?**

Global Custom Colors are brand colors stored in **Global Settings** under **Brand Boards**.

- They are **two-way synced**, meaning if you update a color, it automatically updates in all the places it was used (emails, funnels, forms, pages, etc.).

- By default, they appear in every **color picker** across the platform.


## **How Are They Different from Design Kit Colors?**

- **Design Kit Colors**: Quick-access colors available in the design builder. They **do not sync**, so updating them won’t change existing designs.

- **Global Custom Colors**: Stored at the brand level with **two-way sync**. Update once, and the change applies everywhere that color is used.


**In short:** Design Kit = static quick access. Global Custom Colors = dynamic, synced brand consistency.

## **Benefits of Global Custom Colors**

1. **Consistency Across Assets** – Maintain the same look and feel in all designs.

2. **Time-Saving** – Update a color once, and it reflects everywhere.

3. **Easy Rebranding** – Agencies can clone/share funnels, emails, and quickly rebrand new locations just by updating the global colors.

4. **Always Accessible** – Global colors show up in every color picker.

5. **Quick Import** – Bring in your existing custom values for faster setup.

**FAQs**

**Q: Will changing a Global Color update my existing assets?**

A: Yes. Global Custom Colors are two-way synced. Any change reflects instantly across all designs where that color is applied.

**Q: Why don’t I see Global Colors in the color picker?**

A: The section only appears if you’ve added at least one color in Global Settings.

**Q: Can I import my existing custom value based colors?**

A: Yes. You can import them from the **Custom Values** section into Global Settings. This only creates a copy and does not lift and shift the custom value based colors.

**Q: How is this different from Design Kit colors?**

A: Design Kit colors are for quick access only and do not sync. Global Custom Colors sync across all assets.

**Q: Can agencies use this for client onboarding?**

A: Absolutely! Agencies can clone funnels/emails and simply update the Global Colors to instantly rebrand for new clients.
