# Automatic Tax Category IDs and Names

Modified on: Wed, 10 Sep, 2025 at 12:42 AM

This document provides an overview of the tax categories available in GoHighLevel (GHL). These categories help ensure accurate tax calculations across products, services, and subscriptions.

### **Overview**

In GHL, taxes can be applied to transactions, subscriptions, and products using **Tax Category IDs** and **Tax Category Names**. On the UI, businesses can select the Tax Category Name, which corresponds to a unique Tax Category ID on the backend used for calculations and reporting. Proper assignment ensures accurate tax handling and compliance with local and international tax regulations.

### **How to Use Tax Categories**

1. Assigning Categories: When creating or editing a product or default for a sub-account, select the appropriate Tax Category Name from the available options on the UI.

2. Calculating Taxes: GHL uses the associated Tax Category Name to apply the correct tax rate based on the customer’s location and your configured nexus addresses.

3. For APIs, use the Category IDs and Category Names local to GoHighlevel.


### **Notes**

- Regularly review your tax categories to stay compliant with updates to local tax laws.

- If a tax category does not apply to a transaction, select "Non-Taxable" or the relevant **Tax Category Name** to ensure no tax is applied.
