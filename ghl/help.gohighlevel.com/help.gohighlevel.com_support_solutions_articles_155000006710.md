# Multi-Location Incoming Calls on the Mobile App

Modified on: Wed, 15 Oct, 2025 at 11:55 AM

The **Multi-Location Incoming Calls** feature in the HighLevel mobile app ensures that teams working across multiple sub-accounts never miss an important lead. Previously, users could only receive calls from the sub-account they were currently logged into - causing missed opportunities, delayed responses, and unnecessary account switching.

With this new enhancement, you can now **receive calls from up to 10 locations** directly on your mobile app, regardless of which sub-account you’re currently active in. Each incoming call clearly displays the **originating location**, and you can even **switch to that location mid-call** to take notes, access contacts, and update CRM data instantly.

# **What is Multi-Location Incoming Calls?**

```
Currently available only in the mobile app.
You must be a member of all locations to receive calls from them.
Maximum 10 locations at a time.
```

**Multi-Location Incoming Calls** is a mobile feature that allows users to **opt in** to receive calls from multiple sub-accounts (locations) simultaneously. Once enabled, your phone rings for calls coming into **any of your selected locations**—no matter which one you’re logged into.

Each incoming call screen shows a **Location Badge** identifying which sub-account the call is coming from. During the call, you can **switch directly** into that location to perform CRM actions like taking notes, updating pipelines, or logging the call.

## **Key Benefits of Multi-Location Incoming Calls**

Multi-Location Incoming Calls streamlines lead response across complex organizations.

- **Zero missed leads** — receive calls from up to 10 locations, even if you’re active in another sub-account.

- **Instant context** — a location badge on the call screen shows exactly where the lead sits in your CRM.

- **One-tap workspace switch** — jump straight into the correct location during the live call to view contacts, notes, or deals.

- **User-level control** — each team member chooses which locations are allowed to ring their device, preventing notification overload.

- **Higher productivity** — eliminates frantic app switching and reduces follow-up errors caused by the wrong location context.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I receive calls from more than 10 locations?**

No. Currently, you can select up to 10 locations to avoid performance issues and maintain clarity during incoming calls.

**Q: Do I need admin permissions to enable this?**

No. Any user can opt in to Multi-Location Incoming Calls for their account, as long as they’re a member of the locations they select.

**Q: Will I see which location the call belongs to?**

Yes. The incoming call screen includes a **Location Badge** showing the name of the originating location.

**Q: Can I log call notes while staying on the same call?**

Yes! Tap **Switch Location** during the call to enter the right sub-account and access CRM tools.

**Q: Is this available on desktop?**

Currently, Multi-Location Incoming Calls is available **only on the mobile app**.

**Q: What happens if I’m already on another call?**

A: The incoming call follows your current call-handling rules (e.g., call waiting or voicemail).

**Q: Is the feature available on desktop?**

A: Multi-Location ringing is currently mobile-only. Desktop receives calls only for the active location.
