We’re excited to introduce a powerful new feature in the Prospecting Tool: **Prospect Categories**. This update is designed to help users better organize and manage their growing list of prospects by allowing them to create custom categories, assign them to individual prospects, and easily filter based on those categories. Whether you’re looking to group similar prospects, tag high-priority leads, or streamline bulk updates, this new categorization system makes prospect management more efficient and scalable—especially for agencies handling large volumes of leads.

## **What's New:**

We are delighted to announce that we have added a new feature in Prospecting Tool to add and manage categories for Prospects. This new option will enhance the user experience by giving them the option to create new categories, assign them to prospects and filter prospects via the same categories.

## **Key Features:**

- Users will have the option to create new custom categories inside their prospecting tool.
- They can assign these categories to prospects which will help them to uniquely identify these prospects.
- Filters are added to search for prospects having specific categories.
- Bulk categorisation can also be done so that it is easy to use for existing clients.

## **Benefits for Agencies:**

- With increase in number of prospects, it becomes difficult to manage them effectively.
- This will help to group several prospects or identify unique ones on the basis of categories.
- The use cases can vary from priority to niche, user type to industry type etc.
