- **Assess Data Volume:** Determine the size and complexity of the data to be migrated, including the number of courses, members, and community posts.

### **Step 2:** Define Migration Objectives

- **Set Clear Goals:** Define the primary reasons for migrating to HighLevel, such as better CRM integration, advanced marketing automation, or a more unified platform.

- **Prioritize Features:** Identify the critical components for migration, focusing on community engagement, course content, and member management.

### **Step 3:** Prepare Backup

- **Export Data from Skool:** Export all relevant data (members list, courses, community content) from Skool as CSV files or other applicable formats.

# **Data Migration**

### **Step 1:** Export Data from Skool

- **Export Members:** In Skool, navigate to the Members section and use the export function to download the member list as a CSV file, including names, emails, and any custom fields.

- **Export Courses:** Download course content, including video links, descriptions, and resources, ensuring all course materials are saved for re-upload to HighLevel.

- **Export Community Content:** Manually copy or export important community posts, discussions, and pinned content that needs to be recreated in HighLevel.

### **Step 2:** Import Data into HighLevel

- **Import Members:** In HighLevel, go to Contacts > Import Contacts and upload the CSV file exported from Skool. Ensure all fields are correctly mapped during the import process.

- **Recreate Courses:** Navigate to the Courses section in HighLevel, and create new courses by uploading the previously exported content, including videos, descriptions, and resources.

# **Rebuilding Community and Courses**

### **Step 1:** Set Up Community Channels in HighLevel

- **Create Channels:** In HighLevel, create new channels for each community or discussion group that was present in Skool. Customize the channel settings, including privacy options and access levels.

- **Invite Members:** Send out invitations to all community members via email or unique invite links. Use the Contacts > Send Email feature in HighLevel to streamline this process.

### **Step 2:** Recreate and Organize Courses

- **Set Up Course Structure:** Use HighLevel’s course creation tools to structure courses similarly to how they were organized in Skool. Create sections and modules as needed, and upload all relevant content.

- **Assign Course Access:** Set access permissions for each course, ensuring that only the appropriate members can access specific content, mimicking the access controls previously set in Skool.

### **Step 3:** Manage Member Roles and Permissions

- **Assign Roles:** Assign roles such as Admin, Moderator, or Contributor to members in HighLevel, ensuring that the community hierarchy and permissions are preserved.

- **Set Up Member Permissions:** Configure member permissions to control access to specific channels, courses, and community features based on the roles assigned.

# **Rebuilding Events and Automations**

### **Step 1:** Recreate Events in HighLevel

- **Set Up Event Calendar:** Use HighLevel’s calendar feature to recreate events that were scheduled in Skool. Set up recurring events and ensure that all relevant members are invited.

- **Configure Event Notifications:** Set up automated email and SMS reminders for events to ensure high member participation, leveraging HighLevel’s communication tools.

### **Step 2:** Rebuild Automation Workflows

- **Create Automation Flows:** In HighLevel, navigate to Automations > Workflows to recreate Skool’s automation processes, such as welcome messages, course completion notifications, and event reminders.

- **Test Automations:** Run tests on the newly created automation workflows to ensure they function correctly, making adjustments as necessary.

# **Testing and Validation**

### **Step 1:** Test Community and Course Functionality

- **Perform End-to-End Testing:** Simulate member interactions, such as joining channels, accessing courses, and participating in discussions, to ensure everything functions as intended.

- **Validate Data Integrity:** Cross-check imported data, such as member lists, course content, and community posts, to confirm that everything is accurate and accessible.

### **Step 2:** Validate Event and Automation Setups

- **Run Test Scenarios:** Test each event and automation workflow to verify that triggers and actions work correctly, ensuring a smooth experience for all members.

- **Verify Communication Channels:** Ensure that all communication actions, including emails and SMS, execute properly within the workflows.

# **Decommissioning Skool**

### **Step 1:** Transition Period

- **Run Systems in Parallel:** Consider running Skool and HighLevel in parallel for a brief period to ensure a smooth transition for members and administrators.
