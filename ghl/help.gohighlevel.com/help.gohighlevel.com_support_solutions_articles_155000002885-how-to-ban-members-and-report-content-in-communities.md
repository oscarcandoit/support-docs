## **New Features:**

1. Ban members
    Now members can be banned from a group by the group Admins and Owners. And the banned member will be removed from the group and banned from joining the group again, revoking their abilities to perform any tasks that a regular member of the group can.
2. Report content
    Any post or comment can now be reported by users. Group Admins can access the reported content list and decide wether to keep or remove the reported post/comment and take action on it.

Group admins will also receive Email, in app notifications and push notifications, for any content that is reported.
