# **AI Response Info in Conversations**

AI Response information allows users to:

1. View the AI's underlying components, such as prompts, intents, actions, and data sources.

2. Directly edit knowledge base entries (e.g., FAQs or website data) from within the conversation view.

3. Reflect updates instantly in the AI responses.

This feature is accessible for all AI messages, AI workflow actions, and bot trial messages in your conversations.

# **Benefits of AI Response Info in Conversations**

This feature offers several key benefits:

- **Transparency**: See how the AI generates its responses, including the prompts, intents, and data sources used.

- **Control**: Modify FAQs and website information directly to ensure accuracy.

- **Efficiency**: Update data sources in real-time, improving the AI's performance without navigating away from the conversation.

* * *

# **What AI Response Info is Available?**

1. **Response:** The actual response from the AI to the contact. This response can be edited so the AI bot knows what to respond like in the future, but editing the response will **NOT** change the response that was already sent to the contact in the conversation.

2. **Prompt**: The instructions the AI followed. This prompt can be edited directly in the AI Response Info sidebar.

3. **Intent**: The goal or purpose of the response. This cannot be changed in the sidebar. Navigate to the Conversation AI settings to adjust the intent.

4. **Sources (Knowledge Chunks & FAQs)**: The sources of the AI bot's response will be found in either a URL used to train the bot or an FAQ from the bot's knowledge base entries.
