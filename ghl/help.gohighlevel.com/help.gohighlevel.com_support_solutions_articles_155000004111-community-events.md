# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do I get notified when someone registers for an event?**

Currently, the system does not send admins or event creators a notification when someone registers for an event. Attendees do receive email and in-app notifications, but hosts will not be alerted. If tracking registrations is essential, consider using a custom registration form and workflow to trigger notifications.

**Q: How can a member cancel their attendance for an event?**

There is no official “cancel registration” button for attendees. However, on mobile, members can go to the **Events tab > hamburger menu > event > three-dot menu** and select **Delete** to remove it from their personal calendar view. This action does not notify the event organizer.

**Q: Can I restrict event access to specific groups or members?**

Yes! When creating an event, admins have the option to control who can see and attend the event. Access can be restricted based on membership in a specific course, participation in a private channel, or a user’s engagement level within the group. This allows you to tailor events to specific audiences—such as paid members, internal teams, or users who have reached a certain level of activity—ensuring that the right people have access to the right experiences.

**Q: Can I make an event a paid one?**

Yes, you can set up **paid events** by assigning a registration fee during event creation. You’ll be able to choose the currency and define whether the price applies to just one event or a series of recurring events. Payment handling and access settings are built right into the event setup flow.
