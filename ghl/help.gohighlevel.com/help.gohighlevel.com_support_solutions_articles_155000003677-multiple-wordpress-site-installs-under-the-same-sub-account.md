## **What’s New?**

### **1\. Manage Multiple Sites in One Place:**

- Streamlined Management: You can now add and manage multiple WordPress sites within a single subaccount. This update eliminates the need for separate subaccounts, bringing all your sites together for a more cohesive and efficient management experience.![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033980247/original/BfjihHVkQKfuHOBRZPr1UWXjPIf8zLbxvw.jpeg?1727901362)

- Easy Site Switching: Seamlessly navigate between your different WordPress sites directly from your subaccount dashboard. It’s quick, easy, and super intuitive.![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033980248/original/gtZvqz1FdDdlXwK6eDFgGjkRhlDxcY0BUw.jpeg?1727901362)


### **2\. Enhanced Billing & Subscription Tracking:**

- Accurate Billing: Our billing and subscription systems have been upgraded to track and manage charges for each website under a subaccount individually. This ensures a smooth and transparent billing process, so you can focus on what matters—growing your agency.

- Clear Upsell Opportunities: Agency owners can now easily see how many sites within a location are hosted with or without upselling, helping you to maximize your revenue potential.

### **3\. UI Improvements for Better Navigation:**

- We’ve redesigned the subaccount dashboard to offer a more organized and user-friendly experience.
- Managing your sites and accessing essential features is now more straightforward than ever.

## **How to Get Started?**

### **Access the New Dashboard:**

- Go to Sites > WordPress > All Sites to open the updated dashboard.


### **Create & Manage Sites:**

- Create a new site: Enter all required information, complete payment, and you’re set!
- Switch between sites: From the site info screen, easily toggle between your different sites.
