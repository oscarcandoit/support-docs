## Overview

The Grant/Revoke Private Channel Access workflow action allows for automated management of private channel access, enhancing community interactions and user experience.

## Trigger Name

- Private Channel Access Granted
- Private Channel Access Revoked

## Action Name

- Grant Private Channel Access
- Revoke Private Channel Access

## Action Description

- The " **Grant Private Channel Access**" action is used when a user wants to grant access to a member for a specific channel (private channel) within a community group. **And simultaneously add to community group as well.** This automation ensures that users receive timely updates and can engage with relevant channel - content and members.
- The " **Revoke Private Channel Access**" action is used when a user wants to revoke access of a member to a specific channel (example - a private channel) within a community group, **yet** **keeping them a part of the group**.

## How to Configure

1. **Navigate to the Workflow Builder:** Access the Workflow Builder in your GoHighLevel account.
2. **Create a New Workflow:**
1. Click on "Create a Workflow."
2. Select the relevant action type: "Grant Private Channel Access" or "Revoke Private Channel Access"
3. **Configure Trigger Details**:
   - Specify which group and eventually which private channel you want to grant/revoke access for. You can only see option for private channels and ability to select them, make sure you have relevant private channel
   - **If a member is not a part of the group already, they will be added to the group and eventually the channel you chose.**
   - Add any subsequent actions you wish to automate.

4. **Test Your Workflow**: Ensure that the workflow operates as expected by testing it in a controlled environment.
5. **Save and Activate**: Once confirmed, save your workflow and activate it for use.

## Example

For instance, if a new member joins a book club community, you can set up a workflow that automatically grants them access to the "Book Upgrades" private channel. This ensures they receive immediate updates about upcoming discussions and can engage with other members right away.
