# **What is Google Calendar Integration?**

Google Calendar integration with HighLevel enables **real-time scheduling**, **streamlined availability management**, and **seamless syncing across platforms**. It's ideal for booking calls, automating appointments, and coordinating with your team - all in one place.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Integrating Google Calendar**

- **Real-time appointment syncing** between Google Calendar and HighLevel.

- **Two-way sync** to keep both platforms aligned.

- **Avoid double bookings** using conflict calendars.

- **Supports multi-user setups** with calendar selection per profile.

- **Streamlined scheduling** with improved visibility and control.

* * *

## **Prerequisites for Google Calendar Integration**

1. A valid **Google account**.

2. **Admin** or **user-level access** to HighLevel Calendar settings.

3. The calendar you're connecting **must not be shared** with **conflicting permissions**.

```
Note: Calendar integrations are tied to individual user profiles, not global company settings. Each user should connect their own Google Calendar.
```

* * *

## **Steps to Connect Google Calendar**

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Calendar Connections

1. Go to your sub-account **Settings** and select **Calendars** under **Business Services**.

2. Click on the **Connections** tab and then **\+ Add New** button to add a new calendar.

```
Permissions Required: You must allow full calendar access. Failure to grant "writer" access may result in sync issues.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why isn’t my calendar syncing?**

Check if **permissions were fully granted** during integration. Try disconnecting and re-integrating your Google Calendar using the [Re-Integration Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001181302).

**Q: I don’t see my Google Calendar listed — what should I do?**

Ensure that you’re logged into the **correct Google account**. Log out of all Google accounts and reconnect using the correct one.

**Q: What causes Google Calendar sync to break?**

- Token expiry
- Calendar deleted
- Permissions revoked after connection

**Refer to:** [Why Google Calendar Integration Breaks and How to Fix it](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204159).

**Q: Can I use one calendar across multiple users?**

No, calendar integrations are **user-specific**. Each user must connect their own Google Calendar for personalized scheduling and sync.

**Q. Can I sync multiple Google Calendars?**

Yes, you can link **multiple Google Calendars**. Configure one calendar as the **Linked Calendar** for bookings and others as **Conflict Calendars** to avoid double bookings.

**Q. Do I need a specific Google account type (e.g., Gmail, G Suite)?**

No, both personal Gmail accounts and G Suite (Google Workspace) accounts work with this integration.
