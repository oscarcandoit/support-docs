# **What is Media in SMS Campaigns?**

Media in SMS campaigns refers to attaching images, videos, or files to a message. When you include media, the message automatically becomes an MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), which enables you to send rich content. Unlike plain text SMS, MMS allows longer messages and embedded visuals. However, how media is displayed — and whether it sends successfully — depends on the file format, message length, and the recipient’s device and carrier.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using Media in SMS**

Adding media to your messages can significantly improve engagement, reinforce branding, and increase campaign effectiveness. Understanding how media behaves ensures your content is both attractive and delivered correctly.

- Increases engagement with visual content

- Supports promotions with product images or videos

- Sends richer messages by converting SMS to MMS

- Bypasses the 160-character limit of SMS

- Allows hosting and sharing downloadable files (as links)

- Boosts click-through and conversion rates


* * *

## **MMS vs SMS: What Happens When You Add Media?**

Understanding the difference between SMS and MMS helps you avoid formatting issues and delivery failures. When you attach media, the message becomes an MMS and is subject to different rules than a standard SMS.

When media is attached to a message, HighLevel automatically converts it from an SMS to an MMS. This conversion removes the SMS 160-character limit and allows embedded visuals, but it introduces new constraints such as file type, size, and carrier compatibility.

* * *

## **How Media Appears on iPhone vs Android**

Different devices and carriers may display media differently. Knowing what to expect helps you design messages that appear clean and professional regardless of the device.

- **Android**: Shows media inline with the text. Displays media and message as one content block

- **iPhone**: May show media as a separate message above or below the text. iPhone may split image and message into separate bubbles


These differences are device-specific and cannot be controlled by the sender.

* * *

## **Character Count, Media, and Message Splitting**

Character count and media type impact how messages are delivered and formatted. Here’s what you need to know to avoid delivery problems. Messages without media are sent as SMS and are limited to 160 characters. If you exceed this, your message is split into segments.

- **With media (MMS)**: Long messages are allowed but must stay within the media size limit.

- **Without media (SMS)**: Long messages are split into multiple 160-character segments.


```
Important: If a message includes media and too much text, it may fail to send, especially if the carrier or device doesn’t support the message format.
```

* * *

## **Common Issues and Delivery Risks**

Media messages can behave unpredictably depending on file size, device type, and carrier policies. These are the most common issues to watch for:

- Large files may be stripped or trigger message failure

- iPhones and Androids may render messages differently

- Some carriers may block MMS if flagged content or media exceeds size limits

- Files that can’t be sent directly are hosted and shared via clickable links


```
Tip: Always preview or send a test to your phone(s) before sending to a list.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why did my message send as multiple texts instead of one with media?**

If your message doesn’t include supported media or exceeds limits, it’s sent as multiple SMS messages instead of a single MMS.

**Q: Can I attach a file to a text message?**

Not directly. Files are uploaded to the Media Library and shared as clickable links, not embedded in the message itself.

**Q: What’s the best way to check how my message will look?**

Use the “Preview” feature or send a test message to both Android and iPhone devices to see how your message renders.

**Q: Does the message look the same on all phones?**

No. Message formatting and image placement may vary between Android and iPhone, depending on the default messaging app and carrier settings.
