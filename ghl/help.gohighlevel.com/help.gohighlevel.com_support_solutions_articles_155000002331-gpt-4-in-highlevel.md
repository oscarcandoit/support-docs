## **GPT-4 Turbo: Smarter AI with High-Level**

With the rise of conversational AI, businesses need tools that are smart, scalable, and deeply integrated. HighLevel now brings this power to your automation engine through **GPT-powered AI Workflow steps**. From writing personalized follow-ups and summarizing conversations to generating dynamic email content and social captions, you’ll learn how to make your automations more intelligent, contextual, and human-like with minimal setup.

Whether you're a marketing agency, service provider, or sales team, this guide will help you unlock powerful new capabilities using AI in your existing HighLevel workflows.

* * *

## **What’s New**

- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Now available in AI steps with faster response times and lower cost-per-call compared to previous GPT-4 models.

- **Model Switcher UI**: Select between GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4 Turbo directly in your workflow step.

- **Improved Prompt Handling**: Enhanced merge field support and better handling of complex instructions.

- **System Prompt (optional)**: Add tone or behavior guidance to shape the AI’s personality and output style.


* * *

## **Pricing of GPT-4**

HighLevel’s GPT Action is now billed at **Z** **ero Markup**, meaning you pay exactly what OpenAI charges with no added fees. Pricing is token-based, calculated from the number of input tokens (your prompts) and output tokens (AI responses), and varies depending on the model selected (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT-4o Mini). This shift ensures full transparency and cost efficiency, replacing the old flat execution fee model with one that scales directly with usage.

```
IMPORTANT: Pricing has shifted from a fixed execution fee to a token-based, zero-markup model. Your costs now depend on:

1. The input tokens used in your prompts
2. The output tokens generated in the response
3. The AI model you choose

This means you pay OpenAI's exact rates with nothing more, nothing less.
```

### **External AI Models - Based on Tokens utilized**

- **GPT-4o (per million tokens)**
**Input** \- $2.5

**Output** \- $10.00

- **GPT-4o-mini (per million tokens)**

**Input** \- $0.15

**Output** \- $0.60


**For example,**

With just **$10 in usage**, **GPT-4o** can process around **3 million input words** or generate about **750,000 output words**, while **GPT-4o Mini** offers far greater volume—handling roughly **50 million input words** or producing about **12.5 million output words**. This makes it easy to balance cost and performance, choosing the model that best matches your workflow’s needs.

### **What $10 Gets You**

**GPT-4o:**

- Process approximately 3 million input words OR
- Generate approximately 750,000 output words

**GPT-4o Mini:**

- Process approximately 50 million input words OR
- Generate approximately 12.5 million output words

## **Use Cases and Example Prompts**

| Use Cases | Prompts |
| --- | --- |
| Lead Follow-Up | “Draft a friendly message to {{contact.name}} thanking them for their interest in {{contact.custom\_value.service}}.” |
| Conversation Summary | “Summarize this conversation in 2-3 bullet points.” |
| Email Draft | “Write a persuasive email promoting our {{contact.custom\_value.offer}} to a potential client.” |

## **GPT Models Compared**

| **GPT 3.5 Turbo** | **GPT-4 Turbo** | **GPT-4o** | **GPT-4o Mini** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not as good as 4 turbo | More advanced and powerful | Optimized for specific tasks | Lightweight version of GPT-4o |
| Good responses | Consistent and accurate responses | Consistent with slight trade-offs | Efficient but less comprehensive |
| Not that consistent | Can handle highly complex queries | Handles most queries effectively | Best for less complex queries |
| May struggle to connect the dots | A bit slower than GPT-4o Mini | Balanced speed and performance | Fastest in response time |
| Faster responses | Superior contextual understanding | Good contextual understanding | Adequate for basic needs |
| as per tokens utilized | as per tokens utilized | as per tokens utilized | $0.015 per execution |

## **The GPT-Generated Output**

After selecting and configuring the desired AI model, incorporate a 'GPT powered by OpenAI' action into your workflow to generate dynamic output aligned with your configured prompts."

1. Select the Action Type:




   - Pick from predefined options:
     - Analyze Text Sentiment

     - Summarize Text

     - Translate

     - Custom (for your own prompt)
   - If using Custom, enter your own prompt (e.g., "Write a follow-up email based on this message: {{contact.message}}").
2. Use Dynamic Variables (Optional):




   - Insert dynamic fields like {{contact.first\_name}} or {{event.notes}} into your prompt to personalize the output.
3. Test or Run the Workflow:




   - Once the action is added, you can test the workflow using a contact to see the GPT output in action.

   - The AI output can be used in subsequent workflow steps (e.g., send as an email or SMS).

```
IMPORTANT: If you are concerned about where does the output go,

The AI-generated content can be:-

1. Stored in Custom Fields

2. Used directly in Email or SMS steps
