### **Setting Up the Conversation Form**

1. Add the **Name** of the Conversation form.

2. **Welcome Message/Greeting:**
   - Write a friendly **greeting message** that appears when users click on the CTA button, say "Send Message."
   - Example: _"Hi! Thanks for reaching out. How can we assist you today?"_
3. **Add FAQs or Quick Replies:**
   - Set up 3-5 common **questions or options** users can tap on.
   - Example:
     - _"Tell me about your services"_
     - _"Do you offer discounts?"_
     - _"How can I contact support?"_
4. **Set Up Automated Responses:**
   - Provide answers to FAQs automatically.
   - Example: If a user clicks _"Tell me about your services"_, an automated response can say:

     _"We offer a range of services, including XYZ. Would you like to speak with a representative?"_
5. **Save and Apply the Form:**
   - Click **Create** to save the newly created conversation form.
   - Ensure it is linked to the ad.

```
Notes:
1. Specific preview of how your conversation form will look like can be seen on the form preview screen for each messaging app.
2. The Preview section is dynamic and will show the preview of only those messaging apps that are selected for the engagement ad campaign.
