# **Troubleshooting a Restricted WhatsApp Business Account**

If your WhatsApp Business account is restricted, it means you are temporarily unable to send or respond to messages. This restriction may be applied for security reasons or if WhatsApp detects activity that does not comply with its policies.

## **Why Is My WhatsApp Business Account Restricted?**

Your account may have been restricted due to:

- Violation of WhatsApp Business Terms of Service
- Non-compliance with WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy
- Activity that does not follow the WhatsApp Commerce Policy

If you believe your account was restricted by mistake, you can request a review.

## **How to Request a Review for Your Restricted Account**

Follow these steps to request a review of your restricted WhatsApp Business account:

### Step 1: Access Business Support Home

- Go to Business Support Home

### Step 2: Request a Review

- Click on Request Review
- Check the box to confirm you are a real person

### Step 3: Verify Your Identity

- Enter your mobile phone number
- Choose to receive a confirmation code via SMS or WhatsApp
- Enter the received code and click Continue
- If you do not receive a code, click Get another code

### Step 4: Upload Your Photo ID

- Upload a valid photo ID, such as a passport, driver’s license, or other official identification
- This is required to verify that the account belongs to you
- WhatsApp ensures your personal information remains secure

### Step 5: Submit Your Request

- Click Continue to complete the request
- A confirmation message will indicate that your request has been submitted

## **What Happens Next?**

- WhatsApp aims to review and respond within 48 hours, though in some cases, it may take longer
- Until the review is complete, your account will remain restricted, and you will not be able to send or receive messages

If your appeal is approved, your WhatsApp Business account will be restored. If not, WhatsApp will provide reasons for the restriction.
