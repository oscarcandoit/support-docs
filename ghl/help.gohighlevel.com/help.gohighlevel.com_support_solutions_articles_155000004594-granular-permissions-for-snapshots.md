## Overview

The granular permissions feature for Snapshots provides more control over who can perform specific snapshot-related actions within the system. With this update, admins can assign precise permissions to users, ensuring better security, compliance, and workflow management.

## Available Snapshot Permissions

The following Snapshot actions are now permission-controlled:

- **View Snapshots** – Allows users to browse and access snapshots.

- **Create Snapshots** – Grants users the ability to generate new snapshots.

- **Edit Snapshots** – Permits modifications to existing snapshots.

- **Share/Import Snapshots** – Enables users to share and import snapshots.

- **Push Snapshots** – Grants access to pushing snapshots to accounts.

- **Refresh Snapshots** – Allows users to update snapshot content.

- **Delete Snapshots** – Permits users to remove snapshots permanently.


## How to Manage Snapshot Permissions

Admins can control these permissions for each team member by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your account.

2. Click on **Team** to view your team members.

3. Select the user whose permissions you want to modify.

4. Click **Edit User Option**.

5. Go to the **Snapshot Scopes** section.

6. Enable or disable specific snapshot permissions as needed.

7. Click **Save Changes** to apply the updates.


## Why Use Granular Permissions?

- **Enhanced Security** – Ensures users have only the access they need, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.

- **Better Compliance** – Helps organizations enforce internal policies and prevent data misuse.

- **Streamlined Workflow Management** – Assigns appropriate permissions based on user roles, improving operational efficiency.


## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update user permissions to match role changes.

- Restrict access to sensitive actions like **Delete Snapshots** and **Push Snapshots** to trusted team members.

- Educate team members on their permissions and responsibilities to avoid accidental modifications.
