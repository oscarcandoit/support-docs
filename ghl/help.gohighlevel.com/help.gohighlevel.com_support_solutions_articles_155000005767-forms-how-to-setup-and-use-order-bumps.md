## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I add more than one bump product to a single form?** Yes, you can include multiple bump products in the same form. This allows for multiple upsell opportunities without disrupting the main product flow.

**Q: Can both the main product and a bump product be recurring?**

No. Only one product per form can be recurring—either the main product or a single bump product, but not both. This ensures payment logic remains consistent.

**Q: What happens if I don't include a main product?**

Bump products will not appear unless a main product is also present. Always add a main product first to activate bump product visibility.

**Q: Are bump products compatible with all payment processors?** Yes. Order bumps work seamlessly with Stripe, PayPal, and any other supported HighLevel payment processors.

**Q: Can I rearrange or temporarily disable bump products without affecting the rest of the form?** Absolutely. You can toggle bumps on/off or reorder them at any time without disrupting your main product setup or form logic.

**Q: What types of forms can support Order Bumps?**

Any form that includes the Sell Product element can now leverage the Order Bumps feature.

**Q: Can I personalize the design for each bump product?**

Yes, the feature offers full customization, allowing you to adjust colors, icons, highlight text, and pricing for each bump product individually.

**Q: How many bump products can be added in a single form?**

You can add multiple bump products, providing flexibility to expand your upsell strategy as needed.

**Q: How can I switch between Classic and Modern bump styles?**

The style can be toggled within the bump product settings when enabling the bump feature on your form.
