* * *

### **Please Note**

- This new experience is available as a **Labs feature until 31st December 2025** and must be manually enabled.

## **1\. What’s New in the Revamped Mobile App**

The updated app introduces a **modern design**, a **role-aware homepage**, and **smarter navigation** — built to make you more productive on mobile. Key highlights include:

- A **dynamic homepage** with widgets, pinned apps, and quick actions.

- **Universal Search** for finding anything across conversations, contacts, and opportunities.

- A new **App Drawer** organized into logical business categories.

- **Ask AI**, your personal assistant that helps you draft, create, and act — all from your phone.

- A **true dark mode** that enhances usability and conserves battery life.


## **2\. How to Enable the New Mobile Experience**

Before diving into the new design, you’ll need to activate the experience from Labs.

1. **Update your app** from the App Store or Google Play.

2. Navigate to **Agency Settings → Labs → Subaccounts.**

3. Toggle on **“A New Mobile App Experience.”**

4. Select the subaccounts where you want it enabled.


**Pro Tip:**

We recommend enabling it first on your **agency’s internal subaccount** to explore the new layout and navigation before rolling it out to client accounts.

Once enabled, open the app to instantly experience the redesigned homepage, the new App Drawer, Ask AI, and more.

## **3\. Homepage Overview**

The new homepage acts as your **command center**, surfacing the most important information the moment you log in.

### **Fixed Widgets (Top Section)**

Displays four key data widgets:

- **Tasks Due**

- **Opportunity Pipeline Value**

- **Unread Messages**

- **Today’s Appointments**


> These widgets are fixed for now but will become configurable in Q4 2025, allowing users to customize which widgets appear on their homepage.

### **Pinned Apps Widget**

- Pin up to **four modules** for quick access.

- Tap the **Edit** icon to modify your pinned apps.

- Use the **hamburger icon** to drag and reorder pinned modules.


### **Quick Actions Widget**

- Access **8 fixed quick actions** to perform frequent tasks instantly — no need to navigate between modules.


### **Revenue Chart**

- A performance graph showing **revenue earned over the last 6 months**.


> All homepage elements are **role-aware** — if a user doesn’t have access to a certain module, its widget won’t appear.

## **4\. Universal Search**

The new **Universal Search** makes it faster than ever to find exactly what you need.

- Currently searches across **Conversations, Contacts, and Opportunities.**

- Support for all other modules is coming in **Q4 2025.**

- You can search for **modules** or **quick actions** directly.

- The app remembers your **last 5 searches** for quicker reaccess.

- It’s built to understand context — even locating a specific message from months ago using just a keyword.


> Example: Searching “meeting notes” will instantly show conversations containing that phrase, even from 3 months back.

## **5\. The App Drawer**

The old left-hand navigation is now replaced with a modern **App Drawer**, making discovery effortless.

- Displays modules in a **4-column grid view**.

- Categorized into:

  - **Insights & Productivity**

  - **Communication**

  - **Sales & Operations**

  - **Marketing & Growth**
- Mirrors the structure of the web app for consistency.


> Navigation items like **Settings** and **Notifications** are now located on the **top right corner** of the app with dedicated icons.

## **6\. Ask AI**

**Ask AI** is your built-in business assistant that helps you perform everyday actions using natural language.

You can use Ask AI to:

- Draft social media content.

- Create or edit contacts.

- Generate or edit images.

- Execute supported MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) actions.


Ask AI supports **all MCP actions** except those tied to modules not available on mobile (e.g., Blogs, Funnels).

You can access your entire conversation history through the **Chat History** section, allowing you to pick up where you left off or revisit previous outputs.

## **7\. Core Enhancements**

### **Dark Mode & Modern UI**

Enjoy a sleek, refreshed interface with true-black dark mode, offering better readability and energy efficiency.

### **Performance & Stability**

Faster loading times, smoother transitions, and optimized data caching ensure a reliable experience — even on the move.

### **Streamlined Navigation**

- **Settings** and **Notifications** are now top-right icons.

- **Notifications** include an unread indicator for easy tracking.


### **Abiding by SaaS Configurator**

The revamped mobile app now **fully adheres to the SaaS Configurator**, aligning mobile access with your web-based subscription controls.

Previously, all users had access to every feature on mobile, regardless of their plan. With this update:

- Feature and module access now **respects SaaS plan restrictions**.

- Users on lower-tier plans will no longer see or access modules that aren’t included in their plan.


This change ensures **parity between mobile and web**, maintaining consistency for resellers and customers alike.

## **8\. FAQs**

**Q. Will my existing app automatically update to the new experience?**

A. Not yet. The new experience must be manually enabled under Labs.

**Q. Can I customize my homepage widgets?**

A. Not at launch, but full customization is coming in Q4 2025.

**Q. Does Ask AI support all modules?**

A. Ask AI supports all MCP features except for modules not yet available on mobile, such as Blogs and Funnels.

**Q. How does the SaaS Configurator update impact my clients?**

A. Your clients’ access to modules will now match the features included in their SaaS plan — maintaining consistency across web and mobile.

**Q. When will Universal Search cover all modules?**

A. Full multi-module support will roll out in **Q4 2025.**

**Q. I have a whitelabelled mobile app. Will I have access to the new experience?**

A. Absolutely. The new experience is available for all mobile apps. However, due to structural changes on the new look, existing customizations on your app will break, which is why we recommend turning the new experience on for your agency's internal subaccount. A brand new whitelabel mobile app customizer is on the way that will allow you to customize the mobile app in ways never seen before.

* * *

### **Summary**

The new HighLevel Mobile App Experience is a major leap forward — bringing modern design, intelligent workflows, and deep consistency with web. With Ask AI, dynamic dashboards, and streamlined navigation, your business on mobile is now faster, smarter, and more personalized than ever.
