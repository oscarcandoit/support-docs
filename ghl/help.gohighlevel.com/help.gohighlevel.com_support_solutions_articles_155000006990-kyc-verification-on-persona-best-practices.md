# KYC Verification on Persona — Best Practices

Modified on: Thu, 20 Nov, 2025 at 5:50 AM

**Overview**

KYC (Know Your Customer) verification is a crucial step to ensure the authenticity and security of user identities. On **Persona**, this process helps verify that users are who they claim to be while maintaining compliance with regional and company standards.

To ensure a **smooth, secure, and efficient verification process**, it’s important to follow a few key best practices. This article outlines the essential guidelines every user should adhere to during their KYC verification on Persona.

## **Best Practices for KYC Verification**

### **1\. Limit of 10 Attempts**

Each user is allowed a **maximum of 10 attempts** to complete their verification. It’s important to double-check your information and documents before submitting each attempt. Repeated failed attempts may result in delays or temporary restrictions from retrying the process.

**Tip:** Ensure your ID photo is clear, not cropped, and that your information matches exactly with your registration details.

### **2\. Raise a Ticket for “Session Expired” Errors**

If you encounter a “Session Expired” message, it usually means that your verification session wasn’t completed — for example, if you closed the browser or navigated away before finishing the process.

To prevent this, once you begin the KYC verification on Persona, avoid closing, refreshing, or leaving the browser tab until all steps are completed. Closing the tab too early will leave your verification status as “Pending” until the system automatically updates your status, causing your inquiry to expire. You’ll then need to restart the entire verification process, which typically takes up to 24 hours.

You’ll be able to attempt verification again once the pending status has cleared.

If the issue continues beyond 24 hours, please submit a support ticket so our team can review your case and help reset your verification session.

**Recommendation:** Make sure you have a stable internet connection and sufficient time to complete the process in one sitting.

### **3\. Upload a Document from Your Country of Residence**

To ensure successful verification, always upload an **identification document issued by the country you are currently based in**. Using documents from a different country may result in verification failure or additional review steps.

**Examples of acceptable documents include:**

- Passport

- National ID card

- Driver’s license (if locally issued)

- many others


**Note**\- Acceptable documents can vary from country to country.

### **4\. Do Not Use Electronic Replicas of ID Cards**

**Electronic or digital replicas** of identification cards (such as screenshots, scanned copies, or photos displayed on another device) are **not accepted**.

Please ensure you upload an image of the **original, physical ID card**. This helps maintain authenticity and prevents verification delays or rejection.

## **Additional Tips for a Smooth Experience**

- Use a **well-lit environment** when taking document photos.

- Avoid **glare, blur, or cropped edges** on your ID images.

- Ensure your **name and date of birth** match your registered account details.

- Do not use an **expired card**


## **Conclusion**

By following these best practices, users can complete their KYC verification efficiently and avoid unnecessary delays. Adhering to the outlined steps ensures compliance, enhances security, and helps maintain a seamless onboarding experience on Persona.
