# **What is Voice AI Snapshot?**

Voice AI Snapshots are a powerful tool that lets you clone your complete Voice AI setup and apply it to other sub-accounts within HighLevel. It builds on our existing snapshot technology, extending it to include Voice AI agents, settings, workflows, and more — minus the assigned phone number. This feature is especially useful for agencies managing multiple client accounts or businesses scaling Voice AI across brands.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Voice AI Snapshot**

Snapshots enable fast, consistent scaling of Voice AI setups, minimizing setup time and ensuring best practices are maintained across accounts.

- Clone complex Voice AI configurations instantly across sub-accounts

- Maintain consistency in agent behaviors, workflows, and prompts

- Save time by eliminating repetitive manual setup tasks

- Reduce the risk of setup errors and misconfigurations

- Scale your Voice AI setup quickly across multiple brands or clients

- Enable rapid onboarding for new sub-accounts


* * *

## **How To Create and Apply a Voice AI Snapshot**

Replicating your Voice AI setup with Snapshots takes just a few clicks. Follow these simple steps to ensure your setup is copied accurately across sub-accounts.

### **1\. Navigate to Snapshots**

- From the Agency Dashboard, click on Snapshots in the main menu.


### **2\. Create a New Snapshot**

- Click “+ New Snapshot.”

- Select the sub-account that contains the Voice AI configuration you want to replicate.

- In the components checklist, make sure to check “Voice AI.”

- Click Create Snapshot to save.


### **3\. Apply the Snapshot to Another Sub-Account**

- Select the sub-account you want to update.

- Click Apply Snapshot and choose your previously saved Voice AI snapshot.

- Confirm and wait for the setup to be copied.

- Visit the Voice AI dashboard of the new account to assign phone numbers and fine-tune.


* * *

## **What’s Included in Voice AI Snapshots?**

Voice AI Snapshots carry over your core Voice AI infrastructure while leaving out phone number assignments for flexible reassignment.

### **Included**

- Voice AI Agents and their configurations

- Custom prompts and settings

- Workflows that reference Voice AI actions (e.g., update contact info)

- System and user-defined actions tied to the Voice AI logic


### **Not Included**

- Assigned Phone Numbers (must be added manually after snapshot application)


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do Voice AI snapshots include phone numbers?**

No. Phone numbers are tied to specific accounts and must be manually assigned after applying the snapshot.

**Q: Can I modify the Voice AI setup after applying the snapshot?**

Yes. All components carried over by the snapshot can be customized as needed in the new sub-account.

**Q: Are workflows using Voice AI preserved in the snapshot?**

Yes. Workflows that include Voice AI triggers or actions are fully included and function the same way post-import.

**Q: What happens if I apply the same snapshot to multiple sub-accounts?**

Each sub-account will receive a clone of the Voice AI setup. You can then make sub-account-specific customizations.

**Q: Is this feature available to all users?**

Yes. Voice AI Snapshot functionality is included in the standard snapshot feature set and does not require additional licensing.

### **Next Steps**

- Assign phone numbers to your agents in the new sub-account

- Customize Voice AI prompts for the sub-account’s audience

- Reconnect automations or workflows unique to the new sub-account’s operations

- Explore further Voice AI features like AI scheduling or voicemail drops for deeper integrations
