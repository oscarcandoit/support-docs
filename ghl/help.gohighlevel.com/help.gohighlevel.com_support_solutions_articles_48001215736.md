# **What is LinkedIn Integration**

LinkedIn integration in HighLevel allows users to connect their personal profiles or business pages to the Social Planner. Once connected, you can seamlessly schedule, publish, and manage your LinkedIn posts right from the HighLevel dashboard. It streamlines social engagement, saving time and improving content visibility.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Connecting LinkedIn to HighLevel**

Connecting your LinkedIn account offers powerful capabilities to boost your social media strategy:

- Schedule and publish posts to LinkedIn profiles or pages directly.
- Manage multiple accounts across social platforms in one place.
- View the connection status and token validity to maintain uptime.
- Easily reconnect or refresh access if permissions expire.
- Control user access and permissions for collaborative teams.

* * *

## **Configuring the LinkedIn Integration**

Before you begin setting up LinkedIn, make sure you have **admin access to the LinkedIn Page** you want to connect. The integration token is valid for approximately **60 days**, after which you’ll see a **“Reconnect” prompt** to renew access. If the connection fails due to missing permissions, the account will display a **“Permissions Missing”** status—simply follow the setup steps again to reauthorize the connection successfully.

### **Navigate to the Social Planner**

From the left sidebar, go to Marketing > Social Planner. This is where you manage all your scheduled content across connected social platforms.

### **Open Social Planner Settings**

### **Grant Permissions**

LinkedIn will ask you to authorize access to your account through LeadConnector. Click Allow to proceed.

```
Note: If you’re connecting for advertising purposes, ensure your LinkedIn login has Super Admin or Campaign Manager access to the ad account. Otherwise, the account may not appear later in Social Planner.
```

### **Choose LinkedIn Profile or Page**

After granting access, select the LinkedIn profile or business page you want to connect and click Add.

### **Connection Confirmation**

Once added, the account will show as Connected in the Social Accounts section, along with type and token validity.

```
Suggestion: If you don’t see your ad account after a successful connection, check that the account is active (not archived or suspended) and that you’ve accepted LinkedIn’s Marketing Developer Terms in Campaign Manager
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I connect both a LinkedIn profile and a business page at the same time?**

Yes, HighLevel allows you to connect multiple LinkedIn accounts—both personal profiles and business pages—based on available access and permissions.

**Q: What happens if my LinkedIn connection expires?**

If the token expires, you will see a “Reconnect” prompt in the Social Accounts tab. Simply click it and reauthorize via LinkedIn.

**Q: Why does it say “Permissions Missing” for my page?**

This usually means your LinkedIn account does not have admin rights on the page or certain permissions were not granted during authorization. Reconnect and ensure full access is provided. For ad accounts specifically, missing permissions often mean your user role in LinkedIn Campaign Manager isn’t sufficient. Try reconnecting after updating your role, clearing your cache, or using an incognito window.

**Q: Can I schedule LinkedIn posts for both personal and company pages?**

Yes, once both are connected, you can select where to publish each post during the content creation process.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many LinkedIn accounts I can connect?**

While there’s no fixed limit in HighLevel, the number of accounts you manage should align with your subscription tier and admin permissions.
