# **What Is the Rich Text Element?**

The Rich Text Element empowers you with advanced formatting capabilities directly within the editor. The all-in-one text box brings advanced formatting including headings, block quotes, inline code, multi-level lists, and highlight colors.

Because everything lives in a single element while using  the same sidebar as the Paragraph element, you can style content faster. Unlike basic paragraph elements, it allows you to seamlessly switch text styles, add block quotes, highlight text, and insert code blocks without needing custom HTML or CSS.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using the Rich Text Element**

Enhance your content creation experience with these major advantages:

- **Easy Formatting:** Effortlessly switch between paragraphs, headings, and styles

- **Advanced Lists:** Create organized content with various bullet styles (disc, circle, square), and numbering formats (numeric, alphabetic, Roman numerals)

- **Highlighting and Quotes:** Emphasize important content with customizable highlights colors and block quotes

- **Markdown-Style Shortcuts:** Type >, \`code\`, or \`\`\` to auto-create quotes and code blocks

- **No Coding Required:** Eliminate the need for third-party tools or HTML blocks, improving workflow efficiency

- **Zero Learning Curve:** The sidebar matches the existing Paragraph element, so styling feels familiar

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I convert an existing Paragraph element into Rich Text?**

No. The text must be a Rich text element to switch between a heading and paragraph

**Q: How do I create nested lists?**

After creating your main list item, press "Tab" or use the indent option to create nested sub-items.

**Q: Can I use the Rich Text element and Paragraph element interchangeably when writing paragraphs?**

Yes, but Rich Text provides advanced formatting tools not available in the standard Paragraph element.

**Q: Will global fonts and colors apply automatically?**

Absolutely. The element inherits your global theme settings.
