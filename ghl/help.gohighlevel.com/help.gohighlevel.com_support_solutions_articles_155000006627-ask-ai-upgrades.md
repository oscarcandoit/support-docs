# Ask AI Upgrades

Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 9:22 AM

Ask AI Upgrades introduce a smarter, more transparent way to work with HighLevel’s built-in assistant. A new UI, step-by-step “thought planning,” and built-in Support Agent answers make daily tasks faster—no prompt-engineering degree required.

```
IMPORTANT: For now, this capability is available to Agency-level users and admins.

## **What is Ask AI?**

Ask AI is HighLevel’s on-platform virtual assistant that lets you create content, build assets (funnels, communities, images, and more), or simply ask questions—all from one chat window. You’ll find the Ask AI icon in the main navigation bar, and Agency Admins (plus sub-accounts on the Unlimited AI Employee plan) can launch it with a single click.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Ask AI Upgrades**

Ask AI’s latest release focuses on clarity, transparency, and always-current answers.

- Modern, distraction-free interface that keeps prompts, plans, and results in one view.

- “Thinks before it acts” by outlining a visible plan for complex requests, so you stay in control.

- Built-in Support Agent draws from HighLevel’s knowledge base to answer platform questions instantly.

- Progress tracker shows each task as it completes—no more guessing whether AI is “working.”

- Unified experience paves the way for future AI features to live in one assistant.

* * *

## **Redesigned Ask AI Interface**

A cleaner layout now separates three panels—Prompt, Plan, and Output—so you can see every step without scrolling. Hover states highlight clickable elements, and a progress bar shows which subtasks are running. This minimizes “blank-screen” anxiety and speeds up edits because you can jump back to any step before final output.

* * *

## **Thought & To-Do Planning**

Before executing, Ask AI now builds a structured checklist (“Thought plan”) and shows it to you for approval. Each line item becomes a to-do the assistant checks off in real time. You can:

- Edit or delete plan steps before execution.

- Pause the run if a step needs clarification.

- Re-order steps for a custom workflow.

This transparency dramatically improves result quality and gives you a chance to course-correct early.

* * *

## **Support Agent Integration**

Ask platform questions—“How do I enable Conversation AI?” or “Where is the A/B test report?”—and the Support Agent responds with knowledge-base-backed answers. If an automated action fails (for example, permission issues), the agent proposes manual steps instead of leaving you at a dead end. At launch, Support Agent responses are available to Agency-level users and admins.

* * *

## **How To Set Up Ask AI Upgrades**

A few clicks get you started—no extra fees or downloads.

1\. Log in as an Agency Admin or eligible sub-account admin.

2\. Click the Ask AI icon in the top navigation bar.

5\. If you previously docked the chat window, click the resize icon to experience the full-width layout.

Please Note: All future Ask AI sessions will remember your last size and position preference.
