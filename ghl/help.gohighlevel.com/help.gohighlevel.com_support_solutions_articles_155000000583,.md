## **Important Information When Deleting Contacts**

- Only Admins can delete contacts to ensure data security and prevent accidental deletion.

- Deleted contacts can be restored within two months i.e. 60 days.

- Associated data, such as conversations, notes, and tasks, may also be deleted (based on system settings).


## **Best Practices**

- **Double-Check Before Deletion:** Ensure you have selected the correct contacts to avoid accidental data loss.

- **Backup Important Data:** Export contacts to a CSV file before deletion for record-keeping.

- **Regular Maintenance:** Review and clean your contact list periodically to maintain data hygiene.

- **Assign Permissions Wisely:** Restrict deletion capabilities to Admins or trusted team members only.


```
BEFORE DELETING A CONTACT: Once a contact is deleted, all associated data such as conversations, notes, tasks, and activity history is permanently lost. Restoring a deleted contact will not recover this associated data. Please ensure to back up any important information before proceeding with deletion.

## **Manual Deletion of Contacts**

**Step 1:** Open Contacts Page

Navigate to the **Contacts** section in your HighLevel dashboard.

**Step 2:** Select Contacts

There are two different ways to select contacts. You can either select all contacts on a page (or all contacts in your CRM) by clicking the checkbox in the header of the contacts list, or you can select individual contacts by clicking the checkbox next to their name.

Select one or more contacts by checking the boxes next to their names.

**Step 3:** Delete Contacts

Click the **Delete** button at the top of the contact list.

```
If you’re using a Smart List view and don’t see the trashcan (Delete) icon, make sure you’ve selected one or more contacts first. The delete icon will only appear after selection. If it still doesn’t show, you may not have the required admin permissions. Contact your account administrator to confirm.
```

**Step 5:** Confirm Deletion

Confirm the deletion by typing **DELETE** in the confirmation text box.

## **Restoring Deleted Contacts**

If you accidentally deleted a contact, deleted contacts can be restored within two months (60 days).

```

1. Navigate to **Contacts > Restore.**
2. Select the contact(s) to restore.

3. Click **Restore** to bring the contact back into the active list.

4. Confirm the selection to **Restore** the deleted Contacts.

## **Automating Contact Deletion Using Workflows**

HighLevel allows the automated deletion of contacts using workflows. This is useful for removing unsubscribed, inactive, or invalid contacts.

1. Go to **Automations > Workflows** and create a new workflow.

2. Include the **Delete Contact** action in the workflow to automate the removal process.

3. Configure triggers, such as "Contact Tag" or you could create a new tag for these contacts (e.g., "Unsubscribed").

4. Test and activate the workflow.
