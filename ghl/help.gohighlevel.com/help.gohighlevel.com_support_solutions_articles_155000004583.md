# **What is QR Code Generation?**

The QR Code Generator in HighLevel allows you to create scan-ready codes that link to various destinations — such as websites, funnels, review pages, payment links, and more. These QR codes can be customized with brand elements, shapes, and styles and then downloaded for use in print or digital media.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of QR Code Generation**

Creating QR codes in HighLevel offers both convenience and flexibility, making it a powerful tool for marketing, automation, and customer engagement.

- Create QR codes inside any sub-account

- Link to destinations like websites, funnels, reviews, forms, payments, SMS, and more

- Customize with brand colors, shapes, logos, and styles

- Export in PNG, SVG, or PDF formats

- Save and organize QR codes in folders for easy access

- Edit or delete previously created codes anytime

- Test QR codes in real time during the creation process


* * *

## **How to Generate a QR Code**

This section walks you through the full process — from setup to customization to download — using HighLevel’s native QR Code Builder.

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to QR Codes

- From the sub-account dashboard, navigate to **Sites** in the left-hand menu.

- In the upper navigation ribbon, click **QR Codes**.

- Click **Create QR Code** in the top right or **\+ Create New** in the center of the screen.

#### **Step 2:** Add QR Name and Choose Type

- Enter a name for your QR code.

- Select the type of QR code you would like to generate (e.g., Website, Review Link, Funnel, Form, Quiz, Call, SMS, etc).

- Paste in the URL or relevant input (phone number, review link, etc.).

- Click **Next** to begin customizing the design.

```
As soon as you enter your destination details, HighLevel automatically stores the data so you can test the QR Code right inside the Builder before saving. This means you can scan and confirm functionality immediately without guessing or re-editing later.
```

#### **Step 3:** Customize QR Code

Design flexibility is built into HighLevel’s QR Code Builder. Here’s how you can tailor your QR code’s appearance to match your brand.

- Background Color – Change the background behind the QR elements

- Dot Color – Modify the color of the QR’s data dots

- Dot Style – Choose between classic, square, or rounded shapes

- Marker Border & Center – Customize the corner markers' shape and color

- Logo or Background Image – Add a logo in the center of your QR code or overlay a background image




  - Under the Logo tab, choose between no logo, predefined logos (Google, YouTube, etc.), uploading your own logo

  - You can remove the background behind the logo if needed

## **Downloading, Saving and Sharing QR Codes**

Once your QR code is fully customized, you can choose from multiple ways to use it:

- PNG – Best for websites, email, and digital assets

- SVG – Ideal for responsive or scalable designs

- PDF – Suitable for print

- Copyable Link – Instantly share a link to the QR code without downloading the image

- If you’re not ready to download, click Save and the QR code will appear under your QR Codes list.

* * *

## **Managing QR Codes**

You can view, edit, move, or delete any QR code you’ve previously created:

- Navigate to the QR Code dashboard

- Hover over any code to see the action buttons

- Click the blue **Edit** button to edit details

- Click the **3-dot** icon to delete, move or download

- To move the QR code to a new folder, select Move to Folder then select the desired folder

* * *

## **Cropped QR Codes and Transparent PNGs**

- If no background, header, or footer is added, the QR code is automatically trimmed. This ensures a cleaner, more compact appearance.

- True Transparency for PNGs: Create seamless integrations! PNG QR codes can now be generated with 100% transparency. This makes it easy to overlay the QR code onto existing designs or backgrounds in your favourite image editor. To create a transparent PNG, adjust the background color alpha slider to the far left (0% opacity) within the QR code builder.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**
