## ``` Once you migrate a phone number to the WhatsApp Business Platform, you cannot use that number on the WhatsApp Business App concurrently. Your number must be used either on the Business Platform or on the Business App. ```

## **Restrictions for WhatsApp Business Sign-Up**

When signing up for the **WhatsApp Business Platform**, businesses must adhere to the following restrictions:

1️⃣ **New Phone Number Requirement**

    •    Businesses must use a **new** phone number for registration, whether onboarding **manually** or through **Embedded Signup**.

    •    **Existing numbers** that are **currently active** on WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business App **cannot** be used for signup.

## **FAQs**

## Q. I received an error message stating that the number is registered to an existing WhatsApp account. What should I do next?

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043416251/original/x2ne0l3Rhx8UaJ0uQn9n4mOo02IueqAGOA.png?1742215210)

**Answer:**

This error usually occurs in two situations:

1. **Active WhatsApp Account on Your Mobile Device:**

If you currently have an active WhatsApp account on your mobile device, you need to delete that account to connect with the chat account. Follow these steps:
   - Open the WhatsApp app.
   - Navigate to Settings > Account > Delete my account.
   - _Note:_ After integration, you will not be able to use WhatsApp on your phone, and your previous conversation history and contacts will not be migrated
   - [Learn More on how to Migrate an Existing WhatsApp Number to a Business Account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/migrate-existing-whatsapp-number-to-a-business-account)
2. **WhatsApp Number Connected to Another Provider:**

If your WhatsApp number is linked to another provider, you need to create a new WABA account and migrate your number to the new WABA account

## Q. You have already linked the maximum number of phone numbers allowed for this business account. Delete a phone number to continue or request additional numbers.

Meta allows you to have only two phone numbers per WABA account

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043416261/original/T8uaOc3sv-c80F3XOjYTy0jFnPJ2MditMg.png?1742215215)

## Q. Can I use my existing WhatsApp Business App number for the WhatsApp Business Platform?

No, once you migrate a phone number to the **WhatsApp Business Platform**, you **cannot** use it concurrently on the **WhatsApp Business App**. You must choose between the two platforms.

## Q. How do I verify my WhatsApp Business phone number?

Once you’ve added your phone number, you can verify it using one of these methods:

    •    **SMS Verification:** Receive an OTP via SMS and enter it in the Conversations tab.

    •    **Phone Call Verification:** Receive a verification call on your forwarded number and enter the OTP provided.

## Q. Can I change the WhatsApp Business phone number after verification?

No, once a number is verified and linked to the **WhatsApp Business Platform**, you cannot switch it to another number without reconfiguring your account.

## Q. What should I do if I don’t receive the OTP during verification?

    •    Ensure your phone number is correct and formatted properly.

    •    Check if your network provider is blocking verification messages.

    •    Retry after a few minutes or select **phone call verification** as an alternative.

## Q. What happens if my WhatsApp Business account setup fails?

If you experience issues during setup, check the following:

    •    Ensure that your business information is **correct**.

    •    Confirm that you are using a **new phone number** that is not active on WhatsApp.

    •    Retry the **verification process** with a different method (SMS or Call).

## Q. Can I manage my WhatsApp profile from the CRM?

No, you can only manage your **WhatsApp Business Profile** from the **WhatsApp Business App**, not from the **CRM**.

## Q. What are the benefits of using the WhatsApp Business Platform instead of the App?

    •    **Automation & Workflows:** Send messages automatically using CRM workflows.

    •    **Multiple Users:** Manage WhatsApp conversations across your team.

    •    **Template Messaging:** Send pre-approved templates for business communication.

## Q. Can I transfer my WhatsApp Business number back to the WhatsApp Business App?

No, once a number is **migrated** to the WhatsApp Business Platform, it **cannot** be moved back to the WhatsApp Business App.

## Q. What is the difference between the WhatsApp Business App and WhatsApp Business Platform?
