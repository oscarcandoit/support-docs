## **What is the new Neo Classic courses theme?**

**A Dash of Nostalgia with a Modern Twist**: Classic vibes meet sleek, modern UI.

**Clear Navigation, Streamlined Learning**: Say goodbye to endless scrolling! The new layout allows you and your students to navigate between lessons effortlessly. Want to check out a quiz? Boom, one click away. Need to review a module? No sweat.

**Colorful, Yet Professional**: The new theme mixes vibrant pops of color with a clean, professional palette, making every click and interaction smooth and visually delightful.

**Interactive and Intuitive User Experience**: Enjoy a more immersive user experience with improved animations and feedback, making every interaction feel dynamic and engaging, and bringing the interface to life.

**Faster Loading Times**: Experience lightning-fast loading times! We've optimized the backend and streamlined our codebase, ensuring that every page loads quicker than ever. This means less waiting and more learning, keeping you and your students in the flow of education without interruption.

_"Neo Classic is more than just a theme—it’s an experience designed to make your course stand out and keep your students engaged, all while bringing a touch of timeless elegance."_

## **Enhancements and fixes:**

- **Quiz Explanations Finally Here!**: Explanations for quiz answers will now display when added, making it easier for students to learn from their mistakes and ace their next attempt.

- **Single Choice vs. MCQ Clarity**: No more confusion! Single choice and multiple choice (MCQ) questions now have clearly visible tags right next to them, so students know exactly what to expect.

- **Course Progress Bar**: Keep track of your learning journey with a shiny new progress bar right on the Courses screen. It's easier than ever to know how far you’ve come and how much is left!

- **Clear Locked & Drip Lesson Indicators**: Locked and drip categories or lessons are now more distinct, so students can easily spot which sections they need to unlock or wait for.

- **Auto-Complete Button**: Say goodbye to manual marking! After a successful lesson, quiz, or assignment completion, the "Mark as Complete" button automatically converts to "Completed." Less clicking, more learning!

- **Streamlined Start Pages**: Whether starting a quiz or an assignment, we’ve made the entry smoother with improved start pages, so you can dive right in with ease.

- **Improved Status Pages for Quiz & Assignments**: We’ve enhanced the status pages, clearly displaying "In Review," "Pass," or "Fail" results. Plus, instructor notes are right there to guide you along!

- **Full Quiz Review**: After finishing any quiz, learners can now view attempted questions, correct answers, and their total score. It’s feedback heaven!

- **Jump Between Questions Faster**: Switching between quiz questions is now easier and quicker, helping learners breeze through assessments with speed and confidence.

- **Download Control**: Now you can stop the downloading file and see the downloading progress, giving you more control over your resources.

- **Image Preview**: No need to zoom on images anymore! Enjoy a convenient image preview feature for a better visual experience.

- **Shimmers Instead of Spinner** s: We've replaced traditional loading spinners with sleek shimmers, providing a more modern and visually appealing loading experience.

- **Code Optimization**: Our latest updates include significant code optimizations that improve overall system performance and reliability. We've refined our algorithms and cleaned up our code to ensure smoother interactions and a more responsive user experience. Dive into a seamless learning environment where efficiency meets elegance!
