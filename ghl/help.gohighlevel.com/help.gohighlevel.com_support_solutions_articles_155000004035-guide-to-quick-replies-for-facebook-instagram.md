## **Overview**

The Quick Replies feature enables users to create predefined response prompts for Facebook and Instagram messages, allowing for faster and more efficient communication. This feature is especially useful for businesses that receive frequent inquiries, enabling them to respond promptly and maintain engagement with customers.

## **Setting Up Quick Replies:**

- Navigate to the automation section in your dashboard, select **“Workflows”** at the top, and **"Create Workflow"** or edit an existing one.

- Set up a trigger, such as a customer comment on a Facebook or Instagram post, and select the specific post if needed.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036409697/original/Fecr-YY7jrWWnlmRWHjA3oe-5ZdeIMoiUg.png?1731410629)

- Choose “Reply to comment via DM” or “Reply via DM” under Facebook’s interactive messaging options. Set up your template or “Snippet” in the marketing section if it isn’t already done.

****Note:****

- Quick Replies are visible only as part of the most recent message and function as single-tap responses.
- Once a quick reply is selected, the customer cannot change their choice, ensuring a focused interaction.

****Channel-Specific Conditions:****

- Facebook: You can add Quick Replies alongside buttons and images, providing more options for customer interactions.
- Instagram: You can either add buttons or Quick Replies in a message. Quick Replies can only be added when no attachments are included in the same message.
