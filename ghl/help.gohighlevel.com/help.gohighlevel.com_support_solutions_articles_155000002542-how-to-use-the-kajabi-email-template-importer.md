Users can seamlessly import templates from Kajabi by simply sending it in an email from Kajabi to our dynamically generated email ID in just a few steps.

Why We Did It?

Simplicity: We wanted to ensure a straightforward importing flow that can be easily followed by both technical and non-technical users.

Reusability: Providing the option to reuse already created templates from Kajabi enhances efficiency and saves valuable time.

How to Import?

1. Navigate to Email Marketing -> Templates in your account.
2. Click on
New -> Import
Templates.

3. Select
"Kajabi"
    from the dropdown menu.

    to start the import.
