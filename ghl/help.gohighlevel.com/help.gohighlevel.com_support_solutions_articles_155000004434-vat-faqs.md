# VAT FAQs

Modified on: Thu, 9 Jan, 2025 at 9:27 AM

#### _This article applies to non-United States customers only_.

For detailed instructions on updating your agency's Tax ID information, [click here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002382).

**Q: Why is HighLevel charging me VAT/GST/HST?**

A: HighLevel is charging VAT/GST/HST to comply with international tax regulations.

The application of VAT/GST may depend on your jurisdiction. Most customers will only be charged VAT/GST if they did not provide a tax ID number in their billing profile. Some jurisdictions (such as Mexico, Switzerland, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, Serbia, and some Canadian provinces) require that we charge VAT/GST even if the customer has provided a tax ID.

**Q: When will the tax charges begin?**

A: While exact timing will depend on your jurisdiction, you can expect to see VAT/GST charges added to your invoices in early 2025.

**Q: Is VAT/GST/HST being charged to all international customers?**

A: Yes, HighLevel will charge VAT/GST where ever applicable;  however, certain exceptions may apply. For example, VAT/GST will not be collected in the following situations:

- Your country does not require taxation on sales to registered businesses and you have provided a Tax ID number in your billing profile.
- HighLevel has determined, in its sole discretion, that VAT/GST is not applicable to the transaction. Please note that tax laws are subject to change from time-to-time, and such changes in law may impact the applicability and/or amount of tax invoiced.

**Q: I provided my Tax ID number in my profile. Why am I being charged VAT/GST/HST?**

A: You are being charged VAT/GST because certain countries require taxes to be applied to all customers, including B2B customers who have provided a tax ID number. These countries include, but may not be limited to: South Africa, Mexico, Switzerland, Serbia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and some Canadian provinces.

**Q: I tried to provide my tax ID number in my profile, but I got an error message. What should I do?**

A: Please email vat-tax@gohighlevel.com

**Q: I checked the box that said “I don’t have a Tax ID number” and now I’m being charged VAT/GST/HST. But I recently obtained a Tax ID number. How do I update my profile with my Tax ID number?**

A: Please go to the billing details within your profile on the HighLevel platform: https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/billing?tab=payments

**Q: I checked the box that said “I don’t have a Tax ID number” and now I’m being charged VAT/GST/HST. But I recently found my Tax ID number. Can I get a refund of the tax I’ve already paid?**

A: We will evaluate on a case-by-case basis. Please email vat-tax@gohighlevel.com.

**Q: If I have more questions, who can I contact?**

A: If you have questions about the nature of the tax or its applicability, please consult your company’s tax advisor or send an email to vat-tax@gohighlevel.com.
