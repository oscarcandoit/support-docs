# How to import a Funnel From ClickFunnels?

Modified on: Mon, 21 Apr, 2025 at 9:49 AM

The ClickFunnels to GoHighLevel importer is useful for individuals or businesses looking to switch from ClickFunnels to GoHighLevel and want to migrate their existing funnels and pages without rebuilding them from scratch. It could save significant time and effort, particularly for those with many funnels or pages to transfer.

**Please Note:**

```
- This imported will work for both ClickFunnels 1.0 & ClickFunnels 2.0 Funnels.

- Please ensure that you utilize the publishable (live) link, and not the shareable click funnel link. It's essential to import one Funnel Step at a time from ClickFunnels for a seamless experience.
```
