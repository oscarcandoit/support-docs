# **What is Thumbs Up/Down Feedback for Content AI?**

**Thumbs Up/Down Feedback for Content AI** allows you to quickly and easily provide feedback on AI-generated text and images across several tools in the HighLevel platform. This feedback helps the HighLevel team continually tune and improve the quality of AI outputs.

You can give positive or negative feedback on AI-generated content with a simple thumbs up or thumbs down click. For certain tools, additional feedback options are provided when giving a thumbs down to help us understand what went wrong.

# **Key Benefits of Thumbs Up/Down Feedback for Content AI**

**Providing feedback helps HighLevel deliver more useful and relevant AI content. Here’s why it matters:**

- Helps the AI learn and improve over time based on real user input.

- Allows you to report poor or inaccurate AI results.

- Encourages continuous quality improvements in AI-generated content.

- Makes the AI experience more personalized and aligned with user needs.

- Simple and fast feedback flow that fits into your existing workflow.

- Enables better prioritization of AI improvements based on user impact.


# **How to Provide Feedback on AI-Generated Content**

**You can rate AI-generated content quickly and easily. Here’s how it works:**

1. When viewing AI-generated text or image content in supported tools, look for the thumbs up (:+1:) and thumbs down (:-1:) icons under the output.

2. Click :+1: if you are satisfied with the content.

3. Click :-1: if you are not satisfied. In most cases, a mini feedback form will appear:

   - Select a reason for the negative feedback (e.g. “Not accurate,” “Poor quality,” “Doesn’t match prompt”).

   - Optionally add a comment to provide more detail.
4. For **Quick Actions** (like “Fix Grammar” or “Rewrite”), the feedback is collected via a simple :+1: / :-1: with no additional form—designed to keep the flow lightweight.


# **Where Is Feedback Available?**

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does my feedback directly improve the AI content I receive?**

Your feedback helps improve AI performance across the platform. While individual feedback doesn’t immediately change your personal AI results, it helps tune the system for all users.

**Q: Can I skip providing a reason when giving thumbs down?**

Yes, providing a reason is optional, but it’s highly valuable and encouraged.

**Q: Is the feedback anonymous?**

Yes, feedback is used in aggregate to improve AI quality and is not tied to your specific content.

**Q: Can I edit my feedback after submitting it?**

At this time, feedback cannot be edited once submitted. However, you can rate subsequent outputs.

**Q: Will more tools support Thumbs Up/Down Feedback for Content AI in the future?**

Yes! The team plans to expand this feedback mechanism into additional AI-driven features as they roll out.
