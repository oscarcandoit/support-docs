# **What is Threads Integration in Social Planner?**

Threads Integration adds Meta’s text-centric social network to the list of channels you can manage inside HighLevel. By logging in with your Instagram credentials, you can compose, schedule, and track Threads posts alongside Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others, all from one calendar. This closes a major competitive gap and keeps your team working in a single workflow.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Threads Integration**

- **One-stop publishing:** Manage Threads alongside Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more from a single Social Planner calendar, no app switching.

- **Automation that saves hours:** Use Review Flow, RSS Auto-Posting, and Category Queues to auto-fill your calendar and keep Threads active without manual posting.

- **Scale content in minutes:** Bulk-create and schedule hundreds of posts via Advanced CSV Upload, map hashtags, categories, first comment, and more.

- **Fewer publishing surprises:** Compose within API-aligned limits (500 characters, up to 20 images or one 5-minute video) to prevent failed posts and rework.

- **Consistent brand presence:** Schedule ahead and recycle evergreen content so your Threads channel stays on-cadence, even when your team is busy.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does my Threads account need to be public?** Yes. Your Threads account must be public for publishing via Social Planner.

**Q: Why can’t I add a location to my Threads post?** Location tagging isn’t available—this option is currently limited by the Threads API.

**Q: Are analytics and comment management available for Threads in Social Planner?** Statistics and comment management for Threads aren’t supported in Social Planner right now.

**Q: Do I need a separate Threads login?**

No. Authentication runs through Instagram (OAuth 2.0) for the Threads API. You connect the Instagram account linked to your Threads profile.

**Q: Can I mix images and video in one post?**

Yes. Carousels can include a mix of images and/or videos, up to 20 total items.

**Q: What is the text limit for Threads posts, and what happens if I exceed it?**

Threads supports 1–500 characters per post. If you write more than 500 characters, the extra text is automatically posted as a threaded reply (a continuation of your post).

**Q: What happens if my Instagram/Threads token expires?**

Your scheduler will prompt you to Reconnect the Threads account; re-authenticate and scheduled posts resume.

**Q: Can I edit or delete a Threads post from Social Planner after publishing?**

Editing is not supported by Threads. You can delete posts natively from the Threads app.

**Q: Can I schedule Threads posts for multiple accounts at once?** Yes, as long as each Threads account is connected and public, you can cross-schedule to multiple Threads accounts.
