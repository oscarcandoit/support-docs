## Overview

With the latest update, the certificate setup is now more streamlined. Every new course automatically includes a course completion certificate by default, ensuring learners receive a credential upon finishing. Additionally, the new category completion certificate feature will allow certificates to be awarded for completing a specific section of a course.

## Key Benefits

✅ Automated Course Certificates – Every new course includes a default completion certificate, reducing manual setup.

✅ Flexible Certificate Management – Delete or draft default course completion certificates if not needed.

✅ Seamless Integration – Attach both default and custom certificates directly within the course builder.

✅ Category Recognition – Award certificates for completing an entire category within a course.

## How to Use Default Course Completion Certificates

### Accessing Default Certificates

1. Log in to your account.

2. Navigate to the Courses under Memberships and create a new product.

3. A default course completion certificate is automatically included.


### Managing Default Certificates

- Attaching a Certificate Template:.

1. Click on the settings icon (three dots) under the Course Completion Certificate section

2. Select Edit Certificate or Choose Certificate.

3. Attach the preferred template to the course.
- To Delete or Draft a Default Certificate:

1. Click on the settings icon (three dots) and choose Delete or Click on Published icon and select Draft.

## How to Use Category Completion Certificates

### Enabling Category Completion Certificates

1. Go to a Course.

2. Select the Category you want to attach a certificate to.

3. Click on the plus icon to attach a certificate to the category


### How It Works

- The category completion certificate appears as the final lesson in the category preview.

- The certificate is automatically awarded when all required lessons in the category are completed.

- Category certificates cannot be moved – they always remain at the end of the category.

**Note:****Certificates will be triggered only once the course/section is 100% complete**
