# Number Pool Support in Voice AI Agents

Modified on: Thu, 12 Jun, 2025 at 8:27 AM

We now support assigning a Number Pool, a collection of multiple phone numbers to your AI Agents. Calls to any number in the pool will route dynamically based on your agent’s configuration.

```
Important: Ensure you have at least one Number Pool created in order to use this feature.
```
