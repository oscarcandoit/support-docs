## **Which plan is right for you?**

When deciding between the Free and Premium plans for our Prospecting tool, agencies should consider their specific needs and objectives. The Free plan provides essential features such as basic reports and prospecting capabilities, making it suitable for initial exploration and limited usage. However, agencies looking to maximise their prospecting efforts and unlock advanced functionalities should opt for the Premium plan.

The Premium plan offers significant value with enhanced features like unlimited premium reports, detailed SEO and website performance insights, contact details for prospects, and more. These additional capabilities empower agencies to conduct in-depth analyses, target high-potential prospects, and streamline client outreach effectively.

Ultimately, the choice between Free and Premium plans depends on the agency's goals and desired level of engagement. For agencies seeking comprehensive prospecting tools and advanced analytics, upgrading to the Premium plan is highly recommended to leverage the full potential of our Prospecting tool and drive business growth.
