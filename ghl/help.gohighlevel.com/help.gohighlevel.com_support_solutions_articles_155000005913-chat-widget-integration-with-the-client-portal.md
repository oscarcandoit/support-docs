# Chat Widget Integration with the Client Portal

Modified on: Wed, 20 Aug, 2025 at 10:20 AM

Bring real-time support into your Client Portal with the **Chat Widget** Integration. With this enhancement, users can now enable and use Chat Widgets across individual Client Portal child apps—empowering real-time communication and delivering better support experiences. Even better, widget visibility can be toggled **independently per child app**, offering complete flexibility and control.

# **What is Chat Widget Integration with the Client Portal?**

Chat Widget Integration connects a single HighLevel Chat Widget to your Client Portal and lets you decide exactly **which child apps** display it. Instead of embedding code or managing multiple widgets, you select one existing widget and toggle its visibility for **Communities, Courses, and Affiliates**. Conversations route to your HighLevel inbox just like any other webchat.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Chat Widget Integration with the Client Portal:**

- **Real-time support:** Customers get help where they’re working inside Communities, Courses, or Affiliates without switching tabs.

- **Granular control:** Choose exactly which child apps show the widget to align support with business goals.

- **Centralized conversations:** All chats land in HighLevel, keeping records unified for faster follow-up and reporting.

- **Lower friction:** No code embed for the portal; selection happens inside Client Portal settings.

- **Higher engagement:** Timely support increases course completions, community participation, and affiliate performance.


* * *

## **How To Setup Chat Widget Integration in the Client Portal**

Follow these steps to connect your existing Chat Widget to the Client Portal and choose where it appears.

1. In your sub-account, go to **Memberships** **→** **Client Portal → Settings → Chat Widget**

2. Open the **Select Chat** **Widget** dropdown and select the **one** Chat Widget you want to use across the Client Portal.

3. Under **Select Pages**, toggle visibility for **Communities**, **Courses**, **Affiliates** and **Home & Account settings** as needed and **Save Settings**.

4. Validate in the portal:

```
Tip: To change the widget’s look or channels (Live, Email/SMS, WhatsApp), edit the widget itself under Sites → Chat Widget and then refresh the Client Portal page.
```


* * *

## **Child App–Specific Widget Visibility**

Visibility controls tailor your support strategy by audience and context. Turn the widget on for the apps where live help drives outcomes, and keep it off where it’s not needed.

- Toggle visibility independently for **Communities, Courses, and Affiliates.**

- Use different combinations (e.g., on for Courses + Affiliates, off for Communities).

- Changes take effect after saving; refresh your portal page to validate.


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Permissions**

Confirm these basics before setup to avoid “widget not showing” scenarios later.

- You’ve **already created** at least one Chat Widget in the sub-account (see **[Getting Started with Chat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)** and **[How to Use the All-in-One Chat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004779-how-to-use-the-all-in-one-chat-widget)**).

- You have access to **Client Portal** settings in the sub-account.

- (Optional) Channel requirements are met (e.g., WhatsApp number if you plan to use WhatsApp in your widget).


* * *

## **Limitations & Requirements**

- **Single widget in the Client Portal:** You can select **only one** Chat Widget for the Client Portal.

- **Per–child app visibility only:** You can show/hide the widget per child app, but you **cannot assign multiple** different widgets to different child apps.

- **Widget content is global:** The selected widget’s configuration (branding, greeting, channels) applies wherever it appears in the portal.

- **Website vs. Client Portal:** Multi-widget setups for **websites/funnels** do **not** apply inside the Client Portal.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I assign different widgets to different child apps?**

Not at this time. The Client Portal supports a **single** widget selection with **per-child app visibility**.

**Q: Do I need to paste any code to use the widget in the Client Portal?**

No. Selection happens in **Client Portal → Settings → Chat Widget**. No embed code is required for the portal.

**Q: Will the widget appear on every page inside a child app?**

**I** t appears in supported views of that child app. If you don’t see it, refresh and confirm the child app toggle is enabled.

**Q: Can I still use multiple widgets on my public website or funnels?**

Yes, multi-widget setups apply to websites/funnels. They do **not** apply inside the Client Portal.

**Q: How do I change the widget’s greeting, color, or channels?**

Edit the selected widget in **Sites → Chat Widget**. The updates carry into the Client Portal after you save and refresh.

**Q: Does WhatsApp require extra setup?**

Yes. You need a properly configured WhatsApp number before enabling that channel in your widget.
