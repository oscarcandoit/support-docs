# New Theme Customizer for Courses

Modified on: Fri, 28 Mar, 2025 at 8:33 AM

## Overview

The New Theme Customizer is a powerful new feature that enables users to personalize the appearance of their course sites with ease. From logos and search bars to hero sections and course sidebars, users have full control over key design elements to create a visually appealing and branded learning experience.

With intuitive visibility toggles, color and text overrides, custom content blocks, and template-saving options, users can effortlessly design course sites that align with their brand identity—without needing coding expertise. Real-time previews ensure that changes are instantly reflected, while system and custom templates offer flexibility for quick deployment.

This document provides a detailed breakdown of each feature and customization option available.
