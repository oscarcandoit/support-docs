# Troubleshooting WhatsApp Coexistence Chat History Sync Issues (Right After Onboarding)

Modified on: Mon, 11 Aug, 2025 at 10:05 PM

f you’ve recently onboarded your WhatsApp number to Coexistence (Coex) and notice that your **previous chat history is not appearing yet**, it’s likely because the **chat history sync process** has not been completed.

### **Why This Happens**

After onboarding, WhatsApp needs to sync your existing messages from your mobile app to the Coex platform. This process requires your WhatsApp to be actively connected.

### **Steps to Ensure Successful Chat History Sync**

1. **Keep Your Data Connection On**

   - Make sure your phone has a **stable internet connection** (Wi-Fi or mobile data).

   - Avoid switching off your data during the sync process.
2. **Keep Your WhatsApp Mobile App Open**

   - Open WhatsApp on your mobile device and keep it running in the foreground as much as possible.

   - This allows the sync to proceed without interruptions.
3. **Confirm the Sync on Your Mobile App**

   - You will receive a **confirmation pop-up** in your WhatsApp mobile app to begin chat history sync.

   - **Tap “Confirm”** to allow the sync to start.
4. **Wait for Completion**

   - Depending on the volume of your past chats, the sync may take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.

   - Avoid logging out of WhatsApp or turning off your device until the sync is complete.

### **Tips for a Smooth Sync**

- Keep your phone **charged** and connected to a **reliable network**.

- Avoid force-closing the WhatsApp app during sync.

- If you miss the confirmation pop-up, restart your WhatsApp app to trigger it again.


### **Need Help?**

If your chat history is still not syncing after following the above steps, please contact our support team with:

- Your **WhatsApp number**

- The **time you started onboarding**

- Screenshots of any errors or missing chats


We’ll investigate and help you complete the sync process.
