## Overview

We’ve introduced a new feature in workflows—T&C Filter, allowing accounts to filter users based on whether they agreed to the Terms and Conditions (T&C) or not. This enhancement helps streamline user targeting and ensures workflow steps are aligned with compliance requirements.

* * *

## Feature Benefits

- Improved User Segmentation: Filter users based on their T&C agreement status.

- Enhanced Compliance: Ensure only users who have agreed to specific terms and conditions proceed in workflows.

- Customizable Workflow Paths: Create targeted user journeys by setting conditions for users who agreed or did not agree to the T&C.


* * *

## How It Works

### 1\. Adding the T&C Filter to Your Workflow

1. Navigate to the Workflows section.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041376626/original/LWXOQf3ddmc6VlM0bSl8bM1FruET4qQNmQ.png?1739273801)

2. Select the workflow you want to modify or create a new one.

3. Select workflow trigger - ‘Form Submitted’, ‘Quiz Submitted’ or 'Survey Submitted'

4. Click Add Filters.

5. Choose the T&C Filter option.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041376678/original/D075y86pZckMYaRMxqUfgyw0JfHytn3izw.png?1739273826)


### 2\. Configuring the Filter

- Condition Options:

  - Users who have agreed to the T&C.

  - Users who have not agreed to the T&C.
- Apply the filter to the relevant step in your workflow.


### 3\. Save and Test

1. Save your workflow changes.

2. Run a test to verify that the filter behaves as expected.

## Use Cases

- Promotional Offers: Exclude users who haven’t agreed to updated terms from receiving specific offers.

- Feature Access: Restrict access to premium features based on T&C agreement.

- Compliance Management: Ensure only compliant users participate in regulated workflows.

## FAQs

1\. Can I combine the T&C filter with other filters?

Yes, the T&C filter can be used alongside other workflow filters for more advanced segmentation.

2\. What happens to users who haven't interacted with the T&C?

They will be categorized as “Not Agreed,” ensuring clarity in your workflow decisions.
