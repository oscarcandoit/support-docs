# Calendar Integration Disconnection Notifications

Modified on: Tue, 22 Apr, 2025 at 10:45 PM

## Overview

Stay informed when your calendar or video conferencing integrations disconnect. You would be notified via **Email**, **SMS**, and **Push notifications (Web & Mobile)** so you can take quick action and minimize disruptions to your bookings and client communication.

Notifications are triggered for disconnections from the following integrations:

- Google Calendar

- Outlook Calendar

- iCloud Calendar

- Zoom

- Microsoft Teams


These notifications help ensure that your daily tasks remain uninterrupted by providing disconnection alerts along with simple reconnection steps.

## How to Use

### 1\. **Enable or Disable Notifications**

You can manage your notification preferences from your profile settings:

- Navigate to **My Profile > Notifications**

- Scroll to the **Calendar** section

- Enable or disable each type of notification based on your preference:

  - ✅ **In-App**

  - **✅ Email**

  - ✅ **SMS**

> Push notifications are supported on both the **Web App** and the **Mobile App**.

- Email and SMS notifications **may incur charges** depending on your account setup and configuration. Please review your communication settings to understand any applicable costs.
- **SMS Delivery Rules**:
  - SMS will only be sent if a **user phone number is configured at the sub-account level**.
  - If no number is set, **SMS will not be sent**.
