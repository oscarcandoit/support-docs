# How to select or filter products per Ecommerce Store?

Modified on: Thu, 30 Jan, 2025 at 4:51 AM

## **Overview**

The _Product Selection per Store_ feature enables store owners to control which products are visible in specific stores within a sub-account. This enhancement provides better inventory management, allowing businesses to tailor their product offerings for different stores.

## **Feature Breakdown**

### **1\. "Include in Online Store" Toggle for Products**

This toggle determines whether a product is available for store selection.

- **Enabled**: The product will be available for inclusion or exclusion in the _Products_ section across all stores.
- **Disabled**: The product will not appear in the _Stores → Products_ section for any store.

### **2\. Product Listing Behavior**

- When a new store is created, all products with the "Include in Online Store" toggle enabled will be automatically listed.
- Newly created products will be listed in all stores by default if the toggle is enabled.


### **3\. Bulk Actions for Product Visibility**

- Store owners can select multiple products and apply bulk inclusion or exclusion across stores.
- If a bulk action is performed, it only applies to products that do not already match the selected state.


### **4\. Search & Filter Options**

To enhance product management, users can:

- Search products by **Product Name**.
- Filter products by **Collections** to quickly find relevant items.


## **How to Use the Feature**

1. Navigate to **Stores > Select Store > Products section**.

2. Use the **Include in Online Store** toggle to determine product availability.

3. Apply **bulk actions** to include or exclude multiple products at once.

4. Utilize the **search and filter options** to refine product visibility.

5. Changes are automatically **saved** without needing additional confirmation.

## **Key Considerations**

- Products with the "Include in Online Store" toggle disabled will not be available for store selection.
- When a new store is created, only products with "Include in Online Store" enabled will be available.
- Newly created stores inherit product visibility based on the **Include in Online Store** setting.
- Store owners can edit product details directly by selecting a product from the _Products_ section.
