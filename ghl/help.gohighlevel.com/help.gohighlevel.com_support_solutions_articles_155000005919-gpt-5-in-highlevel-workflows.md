## **What is GPT 5 in Workflows?**

GPT‑5 in Workflows is HighLevel’s latest integration of OpenAI’s GPT‑5 family, enabling any workflow to generate or transform text with unprecedented accuracy and speed. By selecting the GPT action and choosing a GPT‑5 variant, you unlock longer context windows, richer reasoning, and lower latency compared to earlier models.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of GPT 5 in Workflows**

Intelligent automation gets real‑time, enterprise‑grade language understanding.

- **Speed:** Accelerated processing for near real‑time execution, reducing wait times for customers.

- **Reliability:** Consistent, high‑quality outputs thanks to GPT‑5’s refined reasoning abilities.

- **Flexibility:** Three model tiers let you balance performance and budget without rewriting workflows.

- **Simplicity:** Native, click‑to‑configure action keeps integration and maintenance effortless.


* * *

## **GPT 5 Models, Pricing, and Token Math**

Choose the tier that matches your volume and performance needs—pay only for the tokens you consume.

| Model | Best For | Max Context Window | Relative Latency\* | Input Cost per 1M Tokens | Output Cost per 1M Tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPT‑5 | Long‑form reasoning, document analysis, high‑stakes copy | 256k | ◼︎◼︎◼︎◼︎ (slower) | $1.25 | $10.00 |
| GPT‑5 Mini (default) | General email drafting, chat replies, marketing copy | 128k | ◼︎◼︎◼︎ (balanced) | $0.25 | $2.00 |
| GPT‑5 Nano | High‑volume classification, short replies, light summarization | 64k | ◼︎◼︎ (fastest) | $0.05 | $0.40 |

```
IMPORTANT: Pricing mirrors OpenAI’s published rates and is billed via your HighLevel AI wallet. Both agency markup and client rebilling apply automatically.
```

### **Token Math**

Mastering token math lets you forecast AI costs accurately and avoid billing surprises. HighLevel bills GPT‑5 usage exactly as OpenAI does, by counting input tokens (your prompt + context) and output tokens (the model’s response). One token is roughly four characters of English text. Charges are prorated to the nearest thousandth of a million tokens (0.001 M).

#### **Example:-** A 400-word email (~2,000 characters ≈ 500 tokens) sent to GPT-5 Mini costs:

- **Input**: 500 tokens × $0.25 / 1M = $0.000125

- **Output**: 500 tokens × $2.00 / 1M = $0.001

- **Total**: $0.001125 for that action.

## **How To Set Up GPT 5 in Workflows**

Proper setup ensures the right GPT‑5 model is applied, balances speed and cost, and keeps your workflows production‑ready. Here’s how to configure it in a few clicks.

### **Step 1:** Select the GPT action

Open your workflow and under 'add action' click the “+” icon where you want the AI step and search for “GPT powered by OpenAI.” Select the GPT action.

### **Step 2:** Choose GPT‑5 Mini, GPT‑5 or GPT‑5 Nano

In the Model dropdown, leave the default GPT‑5 Mini or choose GPT‑5 / GPT‑5 Nano to match your use‑case.

```
Please Note: Compose your prompt or map inbound data fields. (See AI Prompting 101 for best practices.) Save the step and publish the workflow. Your automation now runs with GPT‑5 intelligence.
```

## **Best-Practice Prompt Tips for GPT-5 Models**

- **Provide Role & Format:** Begin system prompts with the model’s role and the exact output schema.

- **Use Delimiters for Long Inputs**: Wrap large documents in triple back-ticks ( \`\`\`\` ) to preserve formatting.

- **Chunk When Possible:** For Nano, split multi-page content into smaller calls to keep cost ultra-low.

- **Include Examples:** Few-shot examples still improve consistency, especially with Mini or Nano.

- **Test Temperature:** Start at 0 – 0.3 for deterministic flows; nudge higher for creative copy.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Which GPT‑5 model is most cost‑effective for large‑volume tasks?**

GPT‑5 Nano offers the lowest per‑token rate, making it ideal for high‑volume or background tasks where speed is less critical.

**Q: Can I change the model later without rebuilding the workflow?**

Yes, edit the GPT action, select a different model, and save; no other steps need adjustment.

**Q: How are input and output tokens calculated?**

Input tokens include the prompt and context; output tokens are the model’s response. Both are metered and priced separately.

**Q: Are there usage limits on GPT‑5 requests?**

HighLevel enforces the same rate limits as OpenAI. Heavy usage may queue requests during peak traffic.

**Q: Does GPT‑5 support longer context windows than GPT‑4 Turbo?**

Yes, GPT‑5 supports up to 256k tokens of context, allowing richer conversations and multi‑step reasoning.
