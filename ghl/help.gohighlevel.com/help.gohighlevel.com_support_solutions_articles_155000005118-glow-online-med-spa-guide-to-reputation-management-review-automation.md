# Glow Online: Med Spa Guide to Reputation Management & Review Automation

Modified on: Fri, 25 Apr, 2025 at 3:12 AM

Before a client walks through your doors, they’ve already checked your reviews. Maybe they searched “best med spa near me,” looked at your star rating, read a few glowing testimonials—or saw one negative comment you forgot to respond to. That impression? It sticks.

Your reputation is your digital aura. It speaks before you do. And in a beauty-forward, trust-driven industry like medical aesthetics, it’s often the deciding factor in whether someone books with you or your competitor.

This guide shows you how to:

- Collect 5-star reviews consistently (without begging)

- Automate post-treatment review requests

- Showcase real client love across your site and socials

- Flag and manage negative feedback proactively

- Use GoHighLevel to make the whole thing hands-free


Let’s build a glowing, high-converting reputation that reflects the luxe experience you deliver.

## **Step-by-Step: Automating Review Requests in GoHighLevel**

### **Step 1: Build a Post-Treatment Review Workflow**

Right after a treatment is when your client feels their best. That’s when you ask for feedback.

Use GoHighLevel’s workflows to:

- Set a **1–2 hour delay** post-appointment

- Send a **text + email** asking for a quick review

- Include a direct link to your Google or Yelp review page

- Optional: Add a reminder message 24 hours later if they haven’t responded

### **Step 2: Personalize Your Messages**

Example SMS:

> “Hi \[First Name\], thank you for choosing \[Your Spa Name\] today! If you loved your visit, would you mind leaving us a quick review? It helps so much. ? \[Review Link\]”

Make it:

- Warm, but not overdone

- Easy to click

- From a recognizable sender name


[**Learn how to configure SMS here**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000890-message-templates-snippets-)

* * *

### **Step 3: Use Tags to Trigger Requests Based on Service**

Want to send different messages to Botox clients vs. facial clients? Use tags.

- Add a tag at checkout (e.g., “Botox Client”)

- Create review workflows by tag category

- Customize messages to mention specific treatments


This adds a layer of personalization that feels elevated and thoughtful.

## **Managing Negative Reviews Gracefully**

Even the best med spas get the occasional off day—or unfair review. The key is how you respond.

Tips:

- **Respond publicly** within 24–48 hours

- Stay professional, empathetic, and solutions-oriented

- Invite the reviewer to connect offline to resolve the issue


Example reply:

> “Hi \[Name\], we’re so sorry your visit didn’t meet expectations. We’d love the opportunity to make it right—please contact us directly at \[email\] so we can connect. Your feedback matters to us.”

## Showcasing Your 5-Star Reputation

Don’t let those amazing reviews sit in your inbox.

Use GoHighLevel to:

- Embed reviews on your website home and service pages

- Add testimonials to landing pages and lead magnets

- Turn reviews into Instagram stories or carousel posts
