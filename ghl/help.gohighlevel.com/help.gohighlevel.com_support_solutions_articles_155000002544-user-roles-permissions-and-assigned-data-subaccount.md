# **What are User Roles and Permissions?**

Sub-account user roles and permissions determine what features a user can access within a specific location in HighLevel. Whether you're giving a sales rep limited visibility or assigning full admin access to a team lead, user roles ensure the right people see and control the right parts of your account. Each user is assigned one of two roles, Admin or User, and can be further customized using granular permissions and visibility toggles like Only Assigned Data. You can also copy permissions from one user to another and restrict visibility on a per-module basis.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Sub-account Roles & Permissions**

Role management isn’t just housekeeping—it drives operational security and efficiency:

- **Data Security:** Restrict contacts, pipelines, and campaigns to approved staff only.

- **Cleaner Interface:** Hide unused menus so team members navigate faster.

- **Accountability:** Attribute every action to a specific user for airtight audit trails.

- **Faster Onboarding:** Clone proven role templates instead of rebuilding settings from scratch.


* * *

## **How to Set Up Sub-Account Roles & Permissions**

Configuring roles and permissions ensures that each team member sees and controls only what they need to. Follow these steps to get started.

#### **Step 1:** Go to Settings › My Staff

Navigate to the sub-account you want to manage. Under **Settings**, click **My Staff**.

#### **Step 2:** Choose a User or Create a New One

Click the **E** **dit** (pencil) icon next to an existing user or select **\+ Add Employee** to create a new profile.

#### **Step 3:** Assign a Role: Admin or User

Click **Roles and Permissions tab** on the left. Then in the Role dropdown, choose:

- **Admin:** full access to all modules and settings in the sub-account

- **User:** restricted access; granular permissions apply

#### **Step 4:** Enable/Disable Modules as Needed

Use the checkboxes to grant or restrict access to modules like Conversations, Workflows, Calendars, Voice AI, etc.

#### **Step 5:** Set 'Only Assigned Data' if Needed

Toggle **Only Assigned Data** to restrict a user’s visibility to only the leads, opportunities, and data explicitly assigned to them.

#### **Step 6:** Save Your Changes

Click **Update** or **Save** to apply the new permission configuration.

* * *

## **Restrict Visibility with “Only Assigned Data”**

Limiting access based on assigned data helps protect sensitive information while empowering users to focus only on their own work. When you turn **Only Assigned Data** ON, the user will only see:

- Contacts assigned to them

- Opportunities where they’re the owner

- Appointments or tasks linked to their name


Example Use-Case: Use this feature for sales reps to ensure they only see and manage their own pipeline without accessing others’ conversations or clients.

## **Assigning Roles & Permissions**

User roles define high-level access, while permissions define which modules they can use. We recommend granting Admin access only to team leads, trusted employees, or internal managers.

- **Admin:** Full control over all tools, settings, and data inside the sub-account

- **User:** Limited access based on permissions; can be restricted to assigned data only

## **Copy Permissions Between Users**

To save time when onboarding new users, you can clone an existing permission set.

1. Go to **Settings › My Staff**

2. Click the **E** **dit** (pencil) icon next to an existing user or select **\+ Add Employee** to create a new profile.

3. Select the **Roles and** **Permissions** tab

4. Click **Copy Permissions** button in the top right

5. Use the **Copy Permissions** dropdown to choose a source user

6. Click **Copy** to apply those exact settings

## **Module-Specific Granular Permissions**

HighLevel now offers detailed control over access to individual modules and their sub-features. Granular permissions allow you to give users precise access to specific tools and features inside a sub-account. This is ideal for managing large teams, limiting sensitive actions, and reducing the risk of accidental changes.

Granular Permissions are available for the following areas:

- **AI Agents**

- **Account Settings**

- **Account Tools**

- **Automation** (includes Workflows)

- **Blogs**

- **Calendars**

- **Certificates**

- **Communities**

- **Contacts**

- **Conversations**

- **Forms**

- **Funnels**

- **Gokollab**

- **Integrations**

- **Marketing**

- **Medias**

- **Memberships**

- **Opportunities**

- **Payments**

- **QR Codes**

- **Quizzes**

- **Dashboard**

- **Reputations**

- **Surveys**

- **User Management**

- **WordPress**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I disable a module for a user but it’s used in a workflow?**

The user won’t see or interact with the module, but workflows will still run. Make sure someone else retains full access to manage those automations.

**Q: Can I assign different permissions for each calendar?**

Yes, calendar permissions are now granular. You can allow booking access to specific calendars or give full management rights.

**Q: Can I bulk assign permissions across users?**

Not. You can use the Copy Permissions feature one-by-one, or request bulk provisioning through our roadmap.

**Q: What’s the difference between Admin at the agency level and Admin at the sub-account level?**

Agency Admins control all sub-accounts, SaaS products, and billing. Sub-account Admins only control a specific location.

**Q: Can a user manage multiple locations without being an agency admin?**

Yes. You can use Account Admins to manage several sub-accounts without giving them full agency access.
