# **What Are Email Sending/Delivery Methods?**

Email sending methods determine how and when your campaigns reach your audience. HighLevel provides four delivery options: **Send Now, Schedule, Batch Schedule, and RSS Schedule**. Each method helps businesses meet specific marketing needs, from urgent announcements to automated blog updates.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Different Email Sending Methods**

Understanding the benefits of each method ensures you maximize deliverability, engagement, and timing for your campaigns.

- **Send Now**: Immediate delivery for time-sensitive campaigns.

- **Schedule**: Allows planning campaigns ahead for specific dates/times.

- **Batch Schedule**: Improves deliverability by sending emails in smaller groups.

- **RSS Schedule**: Automates sending updates from blogs, feeds, or content streams.

* * *

## **Send Now**

The **Send Now** option immediately sends your campaign to the selected recipients according to their location time zone. This method is best for urgent communications such as flash sales or important announcements.

**When to use Send Now:**

- Urgent news or offers.

- Last-minute campaign needs.

- Immediate product updates.


**Setup Steps:**

1. Choose **Send Now** from the delivery options.

2. Enter **Sender Email** and optional **Sender Name**.

3. Write a **Subject Line** and optional **Preview Text**.

4. Select recipients (Smart List, Tags, Segments, or Contacts).

5. Click **Send** to deliver instantly.

## **Batch Schedule**

The **Batch Schedule** option allows you to send large campaigns in smaller groups (batches). This reduces the risk of deliverability issues and spreads out sending over a chosen timeframe.

**When to use Batch Schedule:**

- Large recipient lists (thousands of contacts).

- Preventing server throttling.

- Ensuring consistent deliverability.


**Example:** If you have 1000 contacts and set batch quantity to 100, emails are delivered in 10 rounds.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Select **Batch Schedule**.

2. Define **Start Date/Time**.

3. Set **Batch Quantity** and **Repeat Interval**(hours or days).

4. Configure sender details, subject, and recipients.

5. Save and confirm.

## **RSS Schedule**

The **RSS Schedule** option is designed for automated campaigns linked to an RSS feed. Each time the feed updates, an email is generated and sent according to your schedule.

**When to use RSS Schedule:**

- Blog updates.

- Newsletters.

- Automated content delivery.


**Setup Steps:**

1. Select **RSS Schedule**.

2. Enter your **RSS Feed URL**.

3. Choose how often to send (daily, weekly, etc.) and time of day.

4. Configure sender details, subject, and recipients.

5. Save and confirm.
