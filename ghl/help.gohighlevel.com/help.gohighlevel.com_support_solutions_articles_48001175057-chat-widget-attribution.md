# Chat Widget Attribution

Modified on: Wed, 17 Feb, 2021 at 9:20 AM

## Viewing The Traffic Source For Web Chat Conversations

### 1\. View Chat Widget Source On Contact Detail Page

When a contact initiates a conversation via a Live Chat widget, you will see that event displayed in the Activity Tab on the Contact Detail page in Contacts.

Clicking the clipboard icon will open up the form submission (aka the initial message they entered into the Chat Widget) where you can view more information including the source (Organic Search, Direct Traffic, etc.).

### 2\. View Chat Widget Source In Form Submissions

You can also view the traffic source for conversations initiated via the Live Chat widget by going to Marketing > Form Builder > Submissions Tab and then selecting "Widget Form" from the Chat Widget section of the Form Selector drop down.

## Notes:

- Yes, attribution will work for Live Chat Widgets that you've added to non-HighLevel websites, including sites you use the LeadConnector Wordpress Widget on.
- Attribution may not work for some iOS users or any users who have privacy mode turned on as it blocks the cookie.
