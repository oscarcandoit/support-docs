# Countdown Timer Placeholder

Modified on: Wed, 18 Jun, 2025 at 12:24 PM

When you embed a countdown timer into a template, and then copy that template to a different subaccount, the countdown timer will be replaced by a static placeholder.

```
The countdown timer placeholder only works in email templates. Other templates (ex: funnels) are on the way.
```

**Step 1: Embed The Countdown Timer**

Navigate to Marketing > Emails > Templates and create or edit a template to have a countdown timer. You might have to first create a countdown timer if you don't have one already.

**Step 2: Share The Template**

Exit the template and click on the 3-dot action menu, then click on Share.

**Step 3: Copy The Link**

In the Share Template modal, select the appropriate permissions, then click Copy Link.

**Step 4: Open Link In New Tab**

Open the link yourself in a new tab, or share the link with someone else so they can open it. If you're logged into your agency, the page will open and you can click Add Template.

**Step 5: Choose a Location (Subaccount) under the Agency**

In the Clone Email Template modal you can select the subaccount (location) you want to create the template copy in. You can also rename the template copy if you want.

**Step 6: Open the template copy and replace the placeholder with a countdown timer from that subaccount**

Navigate to Marketing > Emails > Templates in the new location and edit the template copy. You should see that the countdown timer is replaced by a non-functional placeholder. Click on it to select a functional countdown timer. You might have to create one if you haven't already.
