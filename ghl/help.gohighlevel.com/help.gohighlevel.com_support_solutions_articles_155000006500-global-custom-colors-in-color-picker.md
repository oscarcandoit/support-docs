# Global Custom Colors in Color Picker

Modified on: Thu, 30 Oct, 2025 at 2:12 PM

Global Custom Colors let you save brand‑safe colors once and reuse them across HighLevel. Add your palette in Brand Boards and it appears in color pickers across emails, funnels, and forms. Colors are two‑way synced—update a saved color and designs using that global color update automatically.

# **What are Global Custom Colors?**

Global Custom Colors are reusable color swatches you define under **Brand Boards → Global Settings.** They surface in the Color Picker throughout builders so teams can apply the exact same brand colors, keep assets consistent, and update them centrally when colors change.

**How it differs from Design Kit colors (Brand Boards):** Design Kit colors live inside a Brand Board and also appear in pickers. Global Custom Colors are an additional, centrally managed palette designed for fast reuse and two‑way syncing on applied instances. Both can appear in the picker; Global Custom Colors only show after you add at least one color.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Global Custom Colors**

- **Consistency Across Assets:** Maintain the same look and feel in all designs.

- **Time-Saving:** Update a color once, and it reflects everywhere.

- **Easy Rebranding:** Agencies can clone/share funnels, emails, and quickly rebrand new locations just by updating the global colors.

- **Always Accessible:** Global colors show up in every color picker.

- **Quick Import:** Bring in your existing custom values for faster setup.

* * *

## **Sync Behavior & Best Practices**

Understanding how sync works helps you change colors confidently without breaking live designs.

- **Two‑way sync on applied instances:** Updating a saved global color updates designs that used that specific global swatch.

- **Add at least one color:** The Global Custom Colors section appears in the picker only after you create at least one color, helping distinguish it from Design Kit colors.

- **Name clearly:** Use functional names (Primary, Secondary, Accent) so teams know which swatch to use.

- **Plan rebrands:** For large changes, duplicate designs if needed, then adjust global colors to propagate updates consistently.


* * *

## **Using Global Settings to Add, Edit & Delete Global Colors**

Use Global Settings to add, name, organize, and manage the colors your team will reuse across builders. Creating at least one color enables the Global Custom Colors section to appear inside the Color Picker.

### **Add a New Global Color**

1. Go to **Marketing → Brand Boards** **→** **Global Settings**.

### **Edit, Rename, or Delete a Global Color**

You are able to edit, rename and delete existing Global Colors from within Global Settings in Brand Boards.

```
Caution: Deleting removes the color from pickers; designs that used that color may update to reflect the removal depending on how the builder stores swatches.
```

- To delete a Global Color, click the **t** **rash can icon.** **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055025839/original/i6jhTZ6JpItE7uYcazq_eSQ4ygDiLW4CqQ.png?1759335938)**

## **Import Global Custom Colors from Custom Values**

If you already store brand colors as Custom Values, import them to quickly populate your Global Custom Colors palette. Import copies eligible values into Global Settings for central management.

**Before You Start**

- Confirm your Custom Values contain valid color entries (commonly HEX codes like `#000000`).

- Use clear names (e.g., `Primary_Color`, `Button_BG`) to make mapping easier when importing.


**Import Steps**

1. Go to **Marketing → Brand Boards → Global Settings**.

2. Click **\+ Add** then **Import**.

3. Select the Custom Values that represent colors and click **Import**. If any selected value isn’t a valid color (e.g., not a HEX code), skip or correct it before importing.

## **Using Global Custom Colors in Builders (Color Picker)**

Once at least one Global Custom Color is saved, a “Global Custom Colors” group appears in the Color Picker inside supported builders. This makes it easy to apply the exact, approved swatches everywhere.

### **Where you’ll see it**

- Emails (drag‑and‑drop builder)

- Funnels & Websites (page builder)

- Forms & Surveys


### **Apply a Global Color within an Editor**

1. Open the builder (e.g., Email, Funnel Page, or Form) and select any element with a color setting (text, button, background, border).

2. Open the **Color Picker**.

3. Click a swatch under **Global Custom Colors** to apply it.

### **Manage from the Color Picker**

Click **Manage** in the Color Picker to jump directly to Global Settings (when available), where you can add or adjust colors.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will changing a Global Color update my existing assets?**

Yes. Global Custom Colors are two-way synced. Any change reflects instantly across all designs where that color is applied.

**Q: Why don’t I see Global Colors in the color picker?**

The section only appears if you’ve added at least one color in Global Settings.

**Q: Can I import my existing custom value based colors?**

Yes. You can import them from the Custom Values section into Global Settings. This only creates a copy and does not lift and shift the custom value based colors.

**Q: How is this different from Design Kit colors?**

Design Kit colors are for quick access only and do not sync. Global Custom Colors sync across all assets.

**Q: Can agencies use this for client onboarding?**

Absolutely! Agencies can clone funnels/emails and simply update the Global Colors to instantly rebrand for new clients.
