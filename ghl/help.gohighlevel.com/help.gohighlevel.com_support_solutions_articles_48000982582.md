# **What is Loading a Snapshot into an Existing Account?**

Loading a snapshot into an existing account means importing prebuilt HighLevel assets like workflows, funnels, emails, and more into a sub-account that is already active. This approach allows agencies to quickly deploy standardized systems to clients without recreating them manually. Unlike creating a new account with a snapshot, this method preserves existing client data and adds or updates selected assets.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Loading a Snapshot into an Existing Account**

Loading a snapshot is a strategic way to duplicate assets across multiple clients.

- **Efficiency**: Speeds up setup by reusing workflows, forms, and other assets

- **Consistency**: Ensures that sub-accounts follow the same structure and processes

- **Flexibility**: Gives you control over which assets are imported and which existing assets are overridden

- **Conflict Warnings**: See what might be overridden before taking action


* * *

## **How To Load a Snapshot into an Existing Sub-Account**

Follow this process to import a snapshot into an existing sub-account.

### **Step 1:** Navigate to "Manage Client"

- From the **Agency Dashboard**, use the left-hand menu to navigate to **Sub-Accounts**

- Scroll down or use the search bar to locate the sub-account you would like to add the snapshot to

- Click the **3-dot icon** located to the right of the sub-account. From the pop-up menu, select **Manage Client**

### **Step 2:** Select and Load Snapshot

- Click the blue **Actions** button in the upper right corner

- From the dropdown, select **Load Snapshot**


```
Note: If you do not see "Load Snapshot", check that access to Snapshots is turned on under User > Roles and Permissions from the agency dashboard
```

### **Step 4:** Select Assets

- Use the checkboxes to select the assets you want to import

### **Step 5:** Resolve Conflicts

- The platform will check for conflicts between existing assets and the ones in the snapshot. You’ll have two options for each conflict:




  - **Override**: Replaces the existing sub-account item with the snapshot version

  - **Skip**: Keeps the current version and excludes the conflicting snapshot item
- After reviewing, click the blue **Proceed** button

### **Step 6**: Confirm the Import

- You’ll be asked to type the word **confirm** to approve the changes

- After typing **confirm**, click the blue **Proceed** button

- A success notification will appear, confirming that the snapshot is being pushed to the sub-account. You will receive an email notification once all information has been transferred.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will loading a snapshot delete my current data?**

No. Data is only replaced if you choose to override during the conflict check.

**Q: Can I preview what’s in the snapshot?**

Not directly. However, you can load selectively and skip assets during the process.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally override an asset?**

The action cannot be undone. Always review the conflict list carefully.

**Q: Can I load multiple snapshots into the same sub-account?**

Yes, you can load more than one snapshot into the same sub-account. Each time you load a snapshot, you’ll go through the same process. Just be aware that overlapping assets may trigger conflicts, so review your selections carefully to avoid unintended overrides.
