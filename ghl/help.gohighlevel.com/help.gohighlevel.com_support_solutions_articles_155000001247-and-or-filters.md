There are 3 types of configuration available for contact filtering. They help create every type of filtered view required to visualize and understand your contacts

**In This Article**

- [AND condition](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001247-and-or-filters#AND-condition)
- [OR Condition](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001247-and-or-filters#OR-Condition)
- [AND and OR Combined](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001247-and-or-filters#AND-and-OR-Combined)

* * *

## AND condition

Every AND condition must be met for each contact this is available in that smart list.

Example: Contacts with a specific tag also having both an email AND a phone

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010833902/original/xq-z8BeOkh-GxsgyJFOV3y_HjMlVsHgcpA.png?1698072082)

## OR Condition

At least one OR condition must be met for each contact that is available in that smartlist.

Example: Contacts having either an email OR a phone OR having a certain tag

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010833933/original/rhHowiLA9lMnTgHbKqRrU-gk8YtaX79UDg.png?1698072105)

## AND and OR Combined

Groups of AND filters can be used with the OR condition among them for higher customization in filtering.

Example: Contact having both an email AND phone OR just an address

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010834005/original/9wAV0tDNP9iEoVTacQjM8Tv_64JCWTgGjQ.png?1698072124)

```
All the internal operators like IS, IS NOT, IS EMPTY, IS NOT EMPTY, CONTAINS, DOES NOT CONTAIN etc are not available for all filter fields yet.
