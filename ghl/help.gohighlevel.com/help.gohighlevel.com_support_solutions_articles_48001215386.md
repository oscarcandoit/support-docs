| **Recipients** | Number of contacts targeted |
| **Delivered** | Successfully accepted by recipient servers |
| **Opened** | One or more views of the email |
| **Clicked** | Clicked a link |

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the difference between soft and hard bounces?**

Soft bounces are temporary (e.g., full inbox). Hard bounces are permanent (e.g., invalid email) and can harm your sender reputation.

**Q: How long do email statistics take to update?**

Most email stats update in near real-time, but some events (like clicks, unsubscribes, or spam complaints) may take a few minutes to appear depending on recipient activity and email provider delays.

**Q: Do I need to use Mailgun to see full email stats?**

Yes. Only Mailgun supports full visibility into key metrics like delivered, bounced, unsubscribed, and spam complaints. Other SMTP providers may only support basic tracking like opens and clicks.
