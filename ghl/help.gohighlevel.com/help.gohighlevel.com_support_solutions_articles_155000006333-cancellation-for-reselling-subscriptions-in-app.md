## **What is In-App Cancellation for Reselling Subscriptions?**

This capability enables users working inside a **subaccount** to view the add-ons they’re subscribed to (e.g., WhatsApp, Listings, WordPress, AI tools) and cancel those **resold Marketplace subscriptions** from the same Billing area where they manage payments and wallet transactions. The experience mirrors agency-side controls but is purpose-built for subaccount access and day-to-day management.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of In-App Cancellation for Reselling Subscriptions**

Understanding the advantages helps teams decide when to use subaccount-level cancellation versus contacting the agency. The items below focus on clarity, control, and a consistent experience across add-ons.

- **Self-service control:** subaccount users can cancel eligible add-on subscriptions without agency intervention.

- **Visibility of details:** see **Plan, Purchase Type, Status, Purchase Date, and Billing Cycle** before taking action.

- **Unified cancellation flow:** a standardized, multi-step unsubscribe modal across products keeps the process predictable.

- **Timing options:** choose **End of billing cycle** (default) or **Cancel immediately** as appropriate.

- **Reactivation window:** if you select **end-of-cycle**, you can reactivate before the effective date.

- **Operational efficiency:** fewer back-and-forth requests between subaccounts and agencies.


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Access**

Successful cancellation depends on being in the correct workspace and having access to the Billing area. Confirm the items below to avoid confusion or missing controls.

- You’re working **inside the target subaccount** (left sidebar breadcrumb shows the subaccount name).

- You have permission to open **Settings → Billing** in that subaccount.

- The subscription you want to manage is a **resold add-on** that appears under **Add-On Products** on the Billing Dashboard. **Scope note:** This article covers **Reselling Subscriptions (add-ons)**, not the **core SaaS plan**.


```
IMPORTANT:This article covers Reselling Subscriptions (add-ons), not the core SaaS plan.

## **View Subscription Details**

Reviewing subscription details first helps you pick the right timing option and verify you’re canceling the intended plan, especially when multiple add-ons are active. Navigate to Subaccount → Settings → Billing → Subscriptions. In the **Add On Products** panel, locate the product card and click **View Subscriptions**.

**What you’ll see (modal columns):**

- **Plan:** the subscribed plan name for the product.

- **Purchase Type:** where/how it was purchased (e.g., “Agency Purchase (Without Upsell)”).

- **Status:** e.g., Active, Active (Trial).

- **Purchase Date:** the date the subscription began.

- **Billing Cycle:** the cadence for renewals.

- **Actions (⋮):** management menu, including **Cancel Subscription**.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Who can cancel resold add-on subscriptions now?**

A. Both **agency users** (from Agency Billing) and **subaccount users** (from Subaccount Billing) can cancel supported add-ons. This article focuses on the **subaccount** flow.

**Q. Will I be charged again after I cancel?**

A. If you select **End of billing cycle**, billing stops on the **effective date** shown in the modal. If you **cancel immediately**, the subscription stops right away, and **unused period of service will not be provided**.

**Q. Can I undo a cancellation?**

A. If you chose **End of billing cycle**, you can **reactivate before the effective date** from the same area where you initiated cancellation (if the option is available for that add-on).

**Q. Why don’t I see the Cancel option?**

A. Confirm you are in the **correct subaccount**, have **Billing** access, and are looking at an **eligible add-on**. Some add-ons or billing sources may not support in-app cancellation.

**Q. What’s the difference between SaaS plan cancellation and add-on cancellation?**

A. **SaaS plan** covers the core subaccount subscription and is managed via SaaS tools; **add-ons** are resold Marketplace products managed from **Subaccount Billing → Subscriptions**.

**Q. Do product-specific rules still apply?**

A. The **unified unsubscribe modal** governs timing and confirmation. Some products may have extra considerations (e.g., usage-based charges that settle after cancel).
