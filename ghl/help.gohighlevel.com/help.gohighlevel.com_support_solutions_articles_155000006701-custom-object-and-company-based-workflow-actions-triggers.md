# **What are the Custom Object and Company Based Workflow Actions & Triggers?**

HighLevel Workflows support actions that understand relationships between records (associations). Instead of automating only the record that triggered the workflow, you can target associated Contacts, Companies, or Custom Objects and precisely find records using IDs, external IDs, or field criteria. This enables data‑aware, relationship‑driven automation.

For more information on each workflow action, check out these articles!

## **Key Benefits of Custom Object and Company Based Workflow Actions & Triggers**

- **Deeper Automation:** Build flows that act across Contacts, Companies, and Custom Objects without manual steps.

- **Relationship Targeting:** Filter by Association Label to reach the exact related records you intend.

- **Precision Record Lookup:** Use Find to match via Record ID, External ID, or field filters, including dynamic inbound webhook values.

- **Branching Logic:** Split behavior on Record Found vs Record Not Found and choose Earliest / Latest / All when multiple matches exist.

- **Operational Control:** Add or remove associated records from other workflows to start/stop communications or processes at the perfect moment.


* * *

## **Add Associated Records to Workflow**

Use this action when the current record should trigger enrollment of related records—Contacts, Companies, or Custom Objects—into **another** workflow. Filtering by **Association Label** makes the targeting precise.

**With this action, you can:**

- Select the associated **Object Type** (Contact, Company, or a Custom Object).

- Filter recipients by **Association Label** (e.g., Buyer, Account Owner, Assigned Dealer).

- Choose the **target workflow** those associated records should be added to.


Example: When a Car (Custom Object) is updated to Ready for Sale, automatically add all its associated Dealers to the “Dealer Notification Workflow.”

```
To learn more, see: Add Associated Records to Workflow.

## **Remove Associated Records from Workflow**

Use this action to automatically **unenroll** associated records from a different workflow when conditions change (e.g., Sold/Closed). This keeps contacts and other records out of sequences they no longer need.

**With this action, you can:**

- Target Contacts, Companies, or Custom Objects **via associations**.

- Filter by a specific **Association Label** to remove only the intended relationships.

- Specify the **workflow** to remove them from.


Example: When a Property record is marked Sold, remove its associated Buyers from the “Active Listings Workflow” to stop further notifications.

```
To learn more, see: Remove Associated Records from Workflow.
```

## **Find Object Record / Find Company**

Use **Find** to locate an existing record using **Record ID, External ID, or field filters**. You can pass dynamic values from an **Inbound Webhook**. Choose how to handle multiple matches and branch on **Record Found** vs **Record Not Found**.

**With this action, you can:**

- Match via **Record ID,** **External ID** or **Field-Based Filters.**

- Support dynamic values from inbound webhook triggers (e.g {{inboundWebhookRequest.body.subscription\_ref}}).

- Choose how to handle multiple matches — Earliest, Latest, or All.

- Branch logic automatically for Record Found vs Record Not Found scenarios.

Example: When a webhook posts { "companyDomain": "acme.com" }, find the matching Company record and enroll it in a workflow.

```
To learn more, see: Find Object Record / Find Company.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the difference between “Add to Workflow” and “Add Associated Records to Workflow”?**

The Add to Workflow enrolls the current record type. Add Associated Records to Workflow enrolls other records that are linked to the current record via associations and filtered by a selected label.

**Q: Can I target more than one Association Label at a time?**

Use one label per action. If you need multiple labels, add another Add/Remove Associated Records action for each label you want to include.

**Q: How do Earliest / Latest / All affect the Find result?**

Earliest or Latest proceed with a single best match. All applies the downstream path to each matching record.
