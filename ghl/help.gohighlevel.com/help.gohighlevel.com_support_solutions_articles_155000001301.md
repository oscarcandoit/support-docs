# **What is the Documents & Contracts Feature?**

The Documents & Contracts feature lets you create branded, legally binding templates — such as proposals, estimates, or service agreements — and automatically send them through workflows based on specific triggers like a tag being added or a pipeline stage change. This automation ensures documents are delivered at the right moment in your process, eliminates manual follow-up, and helps streamline your sales or onboarding workflows.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Sending Documents & Contracts Using Workflows**

Document automation helps streamline your service or sales pipeline while keeping interactions polished and compliant.

- Send contracts automatically when specific triggers happen

- Use reusable templates with dynamic content (custom values)

- Collect legally binding e-signatures in seconds

- Include pricing/product lists directly inside the document

- Track document delivery, signing status, and completion

- Set up workflows for follow-up actions once a document is signed


* * *

## **How to Create a Document or Contract Template**

Templates are reusable and can include logos, custom values, pricing tables, and more.

#### **Step 1:** Open a New Document Template

- Navigate to **Payments > Documents & Contracts > Templates**.

- Click **\+ New** → _Create New Template_.

- Give your template a name (e.g., "Proposal").

#### **Step 2:** Design the Document Template

- Use **Add Element** to build the document:


- **Image:** Upload a logo or branding element.

- **Text:** Add contract terms, service descriptions, etc.

- **Custom Values:** Insert dynamic fields like contact name or email.

- **Product List:** Include services or items with pricing pulled from your catalog.

- **Signature Box:** Add a space for the client to sign.


- Click **Save** to store your template for future use.

```
Note: You can edit a saved template anytime from the Templates tab. However, changes won’t apply retroactively to documents already sent or saved as drafts.
```

## **How to Send the Document Automatically via Workflow**

You can automatically send a document template when a specific event happens, such as a tag being added or a pipeline stage change. To use the "Send Documents & Contracts" action, your template must be saved, and the contact must have a valid email address.

#### **Step 1:** Create a New Workflow

- Go to **Automation > Workflows**

- Click **\+ Create Workflow**, and choose _Start from Scratch_.


**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046411342/original/kJPn9QLXNOuPN69wFaCDCMItDFgTlYWFBQ.png?1746821887)**

#### **Step 2:** Design the Workflow

- Select a trigger (such as Tag Added or Opportunity Updated)

- Add the **Send Documents & Contracts** action:





  - Give the action a name

  - Choose the user the document should be sent “from”

  - Select the saved template (e.g., "Proposal")

  - Choose whether to Send Directly or Create as Draft
- Click **Save** and then **Publish** the workflow.

```
Pro Tip: Use “Create as Draft” if you want to review and manually send documents later.
```

* * *

## **What the Contact Receives**

Once triggered, the contact receives an email with a secure link to the document.

- The email includes their name and the proposal or contract details.

- They can click the link and complete the signature directly in-browser — no login or downloads required.


* * *

## **How to Track Document Status**

You can monitor whether a document is in draft, sent, viewed, or completed — all from the Documents & Contracts dashboard.

- Go to **Payments > Documents & Contracts > All Documents and Contracts**.

- Use the tabs at the top to filter by:





  - Drafts

  - Waiting for Others

  - Completed

  - Payments

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I edit a document after it’s sent?**

Only if you selected “Create as Draft.” If sent directly, the document becomes locked and cannot be edited.

**Q: What happens if the contact doesn’t sign?**

The document remains in “Waiting for Others.” You can resend or manually follow up with the contact.

**Q: Can I send documents to more than one person?**

Yes, use Multiple Recipient Support to assign signature elements to multiple people in a single document.

**Q: Can I collect payment when someone signs?**

Yes. If your template includes a product list with pricing, you can enable payment collection using Stripe or another payment integration.

**Q: Are signed documents legally binding?**

Yes, HighLevel’s e-signature process complies with major digital signature regulations for legality and auditability.

**Q: Can recipients sign documents on mobile?**

Yes — documents are mobile-friendly and can be signed directly from their phone’s browser.

**Q: Can I preview the document before it’s sent?**

Yes. Choose Create as Draft mode during setup to preview and manually send after final review.
