## **Why This Playbook Matters**

Most mortgage brokers depend too heavily on real estate agent referrals and outdated lead vendors, leaving their pipeline dry in slow months. But today’s borrowers start their mortgage journey **online**—often _before_ they speak to a lender.

**Key Mortgage Industry Stats:**

- 93% of borrowers research mortgage options online before engaging a lender

- 70% of millennials say they would switch lenders for a better digital experience

- Brokers who run digital ads generate **3.5x more applications** than those who rely solely on referrals


If you’re not advertising on Google, Facebook, or Instagram—your competition is. This playbook will help you change that, using smart, automated, data-backed campaigns.

* * *

## **What You'll Learn**

✅ How to get in front of motivated buyers using Google & Local Ads

✅ How to capture refi-ready homeowners on Facebook & Instagram

✅ How to avoid wasting ad spend with smart targeting & automation

✅ How to follow up instantly and never lose a lead again

✅ How to run retargeting ads that convert drop-offs into funded loans

```
Power up your marketing today—Start with HighLevel!
```

* * *

## **Step 1: Get Found by Motivated Borrowers with Google Ads**

### **Why It Matters**

When borrowers are ready to apply, they go to Google first.

60% of mortgage customers apply with the first lender they engage. If you don’t appear on page one, you’re invisible.

* * *

### **1.1 Run Google Local & Search Ads**

✅ Appear for searches like:

- “Best mortgage broker near me”

- “First-time homebuyer mortgage \[City\]”

- “Refinance FHA loan now”


✅ Target high-intent categories:

- Conventional, FHA, VA, Jumbo

- Cash-out refi, HELOC

- Investment / DSCR / Bank statement loans


**Pro Tip:** Use keywords with urgency:

- “Pre-approval in 24 hrs”

- “Lock your rate today”

- “Refi before Fed hike”


**Example:**

A broker running Google Ads for “No-Doc Refi in Texas” landed 32 funded loans in 60 days with a $42 CPL using a HighLevel landing page and CRM flow.

* * *

### **1.2 Use Call Tracking on All Campaigns**

✅ Assign a unique number to each ad group

✅ Capture & respond to missed calls instantly with HighLevel automation

✅ Attribute every closed deal to the source

**Example:**

Your VA loan campaign has double the lead volume of your FHA refi campaign. With call tracking, you’ll see it—so you scale that campaign and increase ROI.

[How to Create Carousal Adds](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003660-carousel-ads-in-ad-manager)

* * *

## **Step 2: Reach Refi Leads & Buyers with Facebook & Instagram Ads**

### **Why It Matters**

Many buyers aren’t searching—yet. But they’re on social, watching for advice, calculators, and current rate offers.

Facebook ads generate mortgage leads for **$10–$30 each**, with lower competition than Google.

#### [Overview about the Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002433-overview-of-ad-manager)

#### [Connect Facebook with Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003044-connect-facebook-with-ad-manager)

* * *

### **2.1 Create Trust-Building Ads**

✅ Promote:

- Free first-time buyer checklists

- Mortgage calculators & instant quote tools

- Client success stories & fast-funding cases


**Ad Targeting:**

- Location: Zip codes you serve

- Demographics: Ages 30–65, married, homeowner

- Interests: Zillow, real estate investing, home renovation


**Example Ad:**

“Still paying 6%+? Refinance and save $400+/month—run your scenario in 30 seconds. No SSN required.”

[How to Create Facebook Ads](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002439-how-to-create-a-facebook-form-in-ad-manager)

* * *

### **2.2 Use Retargeting Ads to Recover Abandoned Leads**

✅ Remarket to website visitors & dropped leads

✅ Show urgency-based offers (“Rates dropped—lock in 48 hrs”)

✅ Drive re-engagement with dynamic ads

**Example Ad:**

“Still exploring mortgage options? We saved your info—complete your pre-approval today and skip upfront fees.”

[How to Set Up Retargeting Ads using Custom Audience Segment](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003236-create-custom-audiences-in-ad-manager)

* * *

### **2.3 Automate All Follow-Ups from Social Leads**

✅ Every lead goes into HighLevel CRM

✅ Trigger instant text + email drip campaigns

✅ AI chatbot books consults automatically

**Example:**

Borrower clicks on your “Pre-Approval in 60 Seconds” Facebook ad. HighLevel triggers:

- SMS: “Hi Sam! Want us to run your numbers now?”

- AI chatbot handles FAQs

- Calendar link to schedule a call with your loan officer


**Result:** 40% more leads converted by responding faster than competitors.

* * *

## **Step 3: Capture Every Lead with On-Site & Offline Tools**

### **Why It Matters**

Your website’s bounce rate is likely over 80%. Without a chat widget or fast CTA, you’re losing deals daily.

* * *

### **3.1 Use Chat Widget + Smart Forms**

✅ Install Live Chat with AI mortgage bot

✅ Ask:

- Name, loan type, ZIP code, budget, credit tier

✅ Offer instant quotes or call scheduling


**Example CTA:**

“Want a no-credit-pull rate quote? Let’s get started below.”

[How to Set Up Chat Widgets for Mortgage Broker](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)

* * *

### **3.2 Use Text-to-Lead & QR Codes**

✅ Run SMS-based ads or offline capture:

- “Text HOME to 88888 to get today’s rates”

✅ Add QR codes to business cards, open house flyers, signage

✅ HighLevel sends auto responses with links + follow-up drip


#### [How to Use Text-to-Lead Campaigns for Mortgage Broker](https://blog.gohighlevel.com/setting-up-high-performing-sms-campaigns-with-highlevel-your-ultimate-guide/)

* * *

## **Step 4: Track What Works & Optimize for ROI**

### **Why It Matters**

30%+ of ad spend is wasted when brokers can’t see what drives actual funded loans.

* * *

### **4.1 Assign Unique Tracking Numbers**

✅ Create a different number for:

- First-time buyer campaigns

- HELOC/refi campaigns

- Realtor/builder referrals


✅ See exactly where each lead came from

[How to Set Up Call Tracking for Mortgage Brokers](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981393-how-to-set-up-call-tracking-number-pool-)

* * *

### **4.2 Monitor Key Metrics Daily**

✅ CPL (cost per lead)

✅ CPA (cost per application)

✅ CPF (cost per funded deal)

✅ Time-to-first-contact (speed to lead)

**Example:**

| Campaign | CPL | Apps Funded | CPF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FHA First-Time | $28 | 16 | $112 |
| Facebook Refi | $17 | 8 | $81 |

Shift more spend to Facebook Refi—lower cost per deal.

* * *

## **Final Thoughts: Turn Your Ad Spend into Closings**

With a proven ad strategy, you can:

✅ Show up first on Google

✅ Generate daily high-intent mortgage leads

✅ Build long-term trust with automation

✅ Convert cold traffic into funded deals

✅ Scale campaigns based on real ROI
