## **Key Benefits of Calendar Widget Styles**

Understanding the benefits of each widget style helps you choose the right one for your scheduling needs.

## **How To Setup Calendar Widget Styles**

Choosing or changing your calendar widget style ensures that your booking page matches your preferred design and features.

```
Classic vs Neo: Things to Keep in Mind.

It’s important to be aware of how Classic and Neo widgets differ so you can choose the right option for your calendar setup.

Classic is the default for unassigned calendars, while Neo is the default for group calendars. Customization options such as colors, backgrounds, and button text are only available in Neo.

Staff selection in Round Robin calendars also requires Neo, and the Class Booking seat display is only supported in Neo.

Payment collection, however, is supported in both Classic and Neo.

You can switch widget styles anytime without affecting existing bookings.
```

### **Open Settings**

Begin by navigating to the **Settings** menu from the left sidebar. This is where you can manage your account preferences, business details, and calendar configurations.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I switch from Classic to Neo after creating a calendar?**

Yes, you can edit an existing calendar at any time and change the widget style.

**Q: Do all customization options apply to both Classic and Neo widgets?**

No, customization features such as colors, backgrounds, and reorder options are exclusive to the Neo widget.

**Q: Why is Neo the default for Group Calendars?**

Neo supports advanced group booking features, staff selection, and a modern layout better suited for multiple team members.

**Q: Which widget should I use for class bookings with multiple seats?**

The Neo widget is required to display available seats per slot.

**Q: Does switching widget styles affect existing bookings?**
