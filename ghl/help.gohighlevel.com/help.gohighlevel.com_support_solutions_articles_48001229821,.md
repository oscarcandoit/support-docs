# How to Setup SFTP for your WordPress Site

Modified on: Fri, 7 Feb, 2025 at 1:45 AM

SFTP is a way for you to access the files and folders on a website via a client program on your local computer. SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol (or SSH File Transfer Protocol). It was designed as an extension of the SSH (Secure SHell) protocol. We only support SFTP connections within the CRM to ensure your data remains safe and encrypted.
