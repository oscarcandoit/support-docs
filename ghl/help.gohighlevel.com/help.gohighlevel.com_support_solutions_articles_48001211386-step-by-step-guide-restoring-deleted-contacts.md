## **What is Contacts Restore Page?**

The Contacts Restore page is your safety net for retrieving contacts removed from your CRM. It centralizes recently deleted records (within the data‑retention window) so you can bring them back without re‑imports or complex workarounds. This page is especially helpful after accidental deletions or when reversing small clean‑ups.

HighLevel’s October 2025 refresh delivers a faster, clearer Restore experience. You’ll see a clean, modern layout; quick checkboxes to select and recover multiple contacts at once; prominent list columns for Name, Email, Phone, and Deleted On; and a streamlined confirmation dialog that clearly shows how many records you’re about to bring back. Together these improvements reduce clicks, prevent mistakes, and make both single and bulk restores feel safe and predictable.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Contacts Restore Page**

Understanding the practical wins helps you choose the fastest, safest recovery path—whether you’re restoring one record or many.

- **Bulk efficiency:** Select multiple records at once using new checkboxes to restore batches in fewer steps.

- **At‑a‑glance context:** Review key columns (Name, Email, Phone, Deleted On) before you commit to restoring.

- **Safety net:** A confirmation modal summarizes exactly how many contacts you’re about to recover.

- **Time savings:** Restore directly from HighLevel instead of re‑importing CSVs.

- **Consistency:** Restored contacts reappear throughout your CRM so teams can keep working without disruption.


* * *

## **Important Information when Restoring Contacts**

- **Restrictions in HIPAA Accounts**: In HIPAA-compliant accounts, deleted contacts cannot be restored due to strict data security regulations.

- **Time Limit**: A contact can be restored within 60 days only. Beyond this timeframe, the data is permanently deleted.

- **Restoration includes**: When restored, contacts are reinstated with their associated data, such as:
  - Opportunities
  - Notes and tasks
  - Conversations
  - Appointments
  - Workflow and campaign participation

* * *

## **Confirmation Modal**

A clear confirmation step reduces errors by summarizing the scope of your action.

- The modal displays the total number of selected contacts to be restored.

- One click to confirm; restoration begins immediately.

- If any contacts are beyond the retention window or otherwise ineligible, you’ll be notified before completion.

## **Restoring Single/Multiple Contacts**

If you’ve deleted one or more contacts manually, HighLevel makes it easy to bring them back from the Restore tab. This method is ideal for recovering individual contacts or small batches without needing to reverse an entire bulk action.

### **Step 1:** Access the Restore Tab in the Contacts Section

Navigate to the Contacts section in your HighLevel dashboard and select the Restore tab.

### **Step 2:** Find and Select Contacts to Restore

Locate the contacts you wish to restore and select the contacts by clicking the checkbox next to their name. You can select individual contacts or all contacts in the list when restoring.

### **S** **tep 3:**Restore the Contact

Click the **Restore** button next to the contact’s name and confirm the action.

## **Reversing a Bulk Delete**

If you've accidentally deleted multiple contacts using the bulk delete feature, you can easily reverse the action and restore the deleted contacts along with their associated data.

### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Bulk Actions Page

Go to the Contacts section and click on Bulk Actions in the navigation menu. The Bulk Actions page shows a history of all bulk operations performed in your account, including bulk deletes.

### **Step 2:** Find the Bulk Delete Operation

Scroll through the list of bulk actions to locate the specific bulk delete operation you wish to reverse and click on three dots > Restore

### **Step 3:** Click on the Restore Option to restore the Bulk deletion

Select **Restore** again from the Pop-up.

```
Please Note: The restoration process will begin immediately, You can monitor its progress in the Bulk Actions page, where the status will change to indicate the restoration’s progress (e.g., "In Progress" or "Completed"). After the process is complete, navigate back to the Contacts section and Verify the Restored Contacts.
