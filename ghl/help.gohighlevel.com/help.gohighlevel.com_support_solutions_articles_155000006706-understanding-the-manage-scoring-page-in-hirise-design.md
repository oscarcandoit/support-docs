# Understanding the Manage Scoring Page in HiRise Design

Modified on: Wed, 15 Oct, 2025 at 8:07 AM

The Manage Scoring page in HighLevel has been rebuilt with the HiRise design, giving you a faster, cleaner workspace and share-friendly URLs that remember your exact view—helping teams fine-tune engagement scoring with less friction.

# **What is Manage Scoring (HiRise Design Upgrade)?**

Manage Scoring lets you assign or subtract points when contacts take specific actions (opens, clicks, payments, etc.). These points roll up into the Contact Engagement Score, helping you segment and automate follow-ups.

The new HiRise interface preserves all existing scoring logic while upgrading the page layout, performance, and collaboration options.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the HiRise Upgrade**

- Modern, decluttered HiRise styling makes rules easier to scan and edit.

- Up to 2× faster load times on large rule sets for smoother scrolling.

- Shareable URLs keep your search text, page number, and row-limit preferences, so teammates land on the identical view—no re-filtering required.

- Consistent experience with other HiRise-based pages, reducing the learning curve for new users.

- Enhanced accessibility and keyboard navigation for quicker rule management.

* * *

## **Cleaner HiRise Layout**

The page now uses a single-column, wide-table design with improved spacing, color-coded point values, and sticky action headers. This visual clarity helps you spot duplicate or outdated rules at a glance.

## **Persistent View-Sharing Links**

Every change you make to the search box, pagination, or “rows per page” control is stored in the URL. Paste or bookmark the link and reopen it later—or share it with a teammate—knowing they’ll see the exact same filter set you were working with.

* * *

## **Performance Improvements & Scalability**

HiRise’s leaner frontend assets and new caching strategy dramatically cut load times, especially in sub-accounts with 50+ scoring rules. Less waiting means more time optimizing engagement logic.

* * *

## **How To Set Up Manage Scoring**

Fine-tuning engagement scores is unchanged; only the UI is new.

### **Access Manage Scoring**

From your sub-account, click Settings → Manage Scoring.

### **Draft/Publish**

Toggle Draft Mode (upper-right) if you want to stage changes without impacting live scores.

### **Add New Rule**

Click + Add New Rule. Choose an Action Type (e.g., Email Opened) and assign positive or negative points.

### **Edit/Delete Menu**

Use the three-dot menu beside any rule to Edit or Delete.

### **Set/Modify Rule**

Review all changes in the Scoring Rules Table. Switch the Draft/Publish toggle to Publish when you’re ready to go live. Copy the page URL to share your filtered view with a teammate.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will my existing scoring rules change?**

No. The upgrade is cosmetic and performance-based; your rules and point totals stay intact.

**Q: Do shared links also respect Draft vs. Publish mode?**

Yes. The page opens in whichever mode you saved, so collaborators can safely review drafts.

**Q: Can I bulk-edit multiple rules in the new interface?**

Bulk edit is not available yet; edits remain one rule at a time via the three-dot menu.

**Q: Does the faster load time apply to all browsers?**

Yes—HiRise uses lighter assets and browser-level caching that benefit Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

**Q: What happens if two users edit rules simultaneously?**

The last saved version wins. We recommend coordinating via shared URLs and Draft Mode.

**Q: Is there an audit log for rule changes?**

Not on the Manage Scoring page itself, but workspace activity logs capture who published changes.

**Q: Can I export my scoring rules?**

Export isn’t native yet. Use the API or copy the table to a CSV as a workaround.
