## **What is the Processing Charge Feature in HighLevel?**

The Processing Charge feature in HighLevel allows businesses to automatically add extra fees, such as processing charges, convenience fees, or miscellaneous charges to customer payments. This functionality is designed to help businesses offset costs associated with payment processing and provide clear, itemized fees to customers during checkout or invoicing.

**A Processing Charge** is an additional fee applied to a customer’s transaction total to cover costs such as payment processing or miscellaneous service fees. This charge is visible to customers at checkout and reflected on their payment receipt.

The processing charge is applied to the amount calculated as:

**(Subtotal - Discounts + Taxes)** — which represents the actual amount processed through the payment provider.

By enabling this feature, you can define the percentage of the fee, customize how it appears to customers, and choose which payment channels (Invoices, Funnels, Payment Links, Forms, Surveys) the fee applies to. The fee is calculated based on the actual transaction amount, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

### **Where Does This Fee Apply?**

Processing charges can be applied to the following payment sources:

1. Invoices

2. Funnels

3. Forms

4. Surveys

5. Payment Links

6. Estimates


```
IMPORTANT: While all payment providers are supported on Invoices & Estimates, other checkouts don't support this feature on PayPal and Custom Payment Providers.
```

* * *

## **Important Behavior Guidelines**

- Draft invoices reflect the processing charge only if edited after the feature is enabled.

- Invoices already sent or orders already placed before enabling this feature remain unaffected.

- Disabling the feature does not retroactively remove charges from existing invoices or orders unless those documents are still editable.

- Processing charges are displayed as a distinct line item during checkout and included in the final total shown to the customer.

- This charge will not apply to Invoices paid via the mobile app, that feature is Coming Soon.
