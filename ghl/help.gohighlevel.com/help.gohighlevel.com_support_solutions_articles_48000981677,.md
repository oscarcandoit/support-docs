# **What is Mailgun?**

Mailgun is a third-party service we use to send emails in bulk. Similar to how we use Twilio to send text messages and calls. For new onboarding agencies, you will be using [LC email](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001220605) by default, which is living under our Mailgun account.

# **How much will Mailgun cost?**

Mailgun's Foundation plan is starting at $35/month. Learn more about [Mailgun pricing here](https://www.mailgun.com/pricing/).

# **What domain should I use?**

We recommend using a subdomain with Mailgun, like "mg.mydomain.com". Using a subdomain you will be able to send emails from your root domain e.g. "you@mydomain.com".

If using a subdomain please make sure that you configure MX records for the subdomain for optimal delivery. This is configured within your Mailgun account.

Note: You can only add domains you own. You will need to update the domain's DNS records to verify that you are an authorized owner or sender for this domain.

## There are two different ways to set up Mailgun with HighLevel:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Pros: | Cons: |
| ### **1\. One Sub-domain**<br>You can set up one sub-domain in Mailgun for your marketing agency domain and use that same sub-domain for email sending across all of your client accounts in HighLevel | - Easy setup - only need to set up one subdomain for your domain which you already have access to<br>- Emails are white-labeled to your marketing agency domain or you can buy a generic domain so it will not show any agency branding | If your domain gets disabled (gets a bad score due to bounce rates) email will stop working for all of your clients since all of their accounts are powered by the same domain.<br>The solution: don't send spammy emails to poor email addresses :-) |
| ### **2\. Multiple Sub-domains**<br>You can set up a subdomain in Mailgun for each of your client's domains and use that subdomain for sending for their specific HighLevel account. Once you set up a unique domain/subdomain for each location to capture cold inbound emails. [Learn more about Cold Email Inbound Setup here.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001185801-cold-email-inbound-setup) | - Emails are white-labelled per the client domain <br>- If a client's domain gets disabled email only goes down for their client account | Difficult setup - time-consuming having to set up a subdomain for all of your clients and getting access to each of their domains |
