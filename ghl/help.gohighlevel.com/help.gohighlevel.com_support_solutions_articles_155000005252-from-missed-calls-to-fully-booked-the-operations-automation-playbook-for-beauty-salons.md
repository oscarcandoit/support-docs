# From Missed Calls to Fully Booked: The Operations Automation Playbook for Beauty Salons

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 3:42 AM

## **Why This Playbook Matters**

You didn’t start a salon to be glued to your phone. But in between foils, facials, and back-to-back bookings, it’s easy to miss a call or forget to follow up.

The problem? Every missed message or slow response is a lost client — and those lost clients stack up.

This playbook walks you through the key automations and workflows that streamline your salon’s operations using GoHighLevel, so you can stay booked without being buried in admin.

> **67% of beauty service clients say they chose the salon that responded to them _first_ — not necessarily the cheapest.**

## **Step 1: Set Up Your Booking Calendar(s)**

Inside GoHighLevel, you can build one or multiple calendars — for each stylist, treatment room, or service category.

### Calendar Setup Checklist:

- Set business hours and appointment durations

- Add buffer time between bookings

- Link to specific services (hair, brows, facials, bridal trials)

- Connect team members (optional)


Once done, embed the calendar on your site, booking page, or send it via SMS.

**[Calendar Setup Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001159-how-to-create-service-calendars)**

* * *

## **Step 2: Missed Call = Instant Text Back**

Clients often call during lunch breaks or late-night scrolls. If no one answers, they move on.

### Here’s what to do:

- Set up a workflow triggered by a missed call

- Send a friendly automated SMS like:


> “Hey! Sorry we missed your call. Want to text us what you need or book directly here: \[booking link\]”

It keeps the conversation alive — and saves you from losing that lead.

* * *

## **Step 3: Automate Confirmations, Reminders & Cancellations**

Clients forget. Life happens. You need systems that remind and re-confirm every visit.

### Use GHL Workflows to:

- Send a confirmation SMS/email when someone books

- Send a reminder 24–48 hours before the appointment

- Include a reschedule/cancel link (automatically updates your calendar)


> No-shows drop by 38% when a salon sends a confirmation + reminder sequence via SMS.

**[Appointment Reminder Setup](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003441-calendar-email-in-app-appointment-notifications)**

* * *

## **Step 4: Pre-Appointment Client Intake (Optional but Powerful)**

If you offer facials, advanced skincare, or bridal services, pre-appointment forms build trust and save time.

### What to include:

- Skin type, allergies, product history

- Bridal dates or style preferences

- Medical info for peels or lasers


Build these as custom forms or surveys in GHL, and send them 24–48 hours before the visit.

* * *

## **Step 5: Tag & Track Internally for Better Coordination**

Use tags and pipeline stages to manage your salon flow behind the scenes.

### Examples:

- “First Visit – Facial”

- “Bridal Lead – Follow Up”

- “High-Spend Client”


Assign internal tasks for team members:

- “Confirm consultation details with Ashley by Friday”

- “Check skincare history before advanced treatment”


**[Using Tags](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002830-adding-contact-tags-to-multiple-contacts)**

* * *

## **Step 6: Collect Payments + Send Receipts Easily**

Whether you’re collecting deposits, pre-payments, or offering memberships — you can do it all through HighLevel.

### Payment Options:

- Send invoices with card-on-file options

- Embed one-click checkout links in funnels

- Connect Stripe for secure payment processing

## **Final Words: Run Your Salon Like a Brand — Not a Messy Inbox**

Operational chaos kills client experience.

With these systems in place, you’ll never miss a call, forget a booking, or double-book again. And better yet — your team can focus on delivering glow-ups, not juggling admin.
