## 1\. **Affiliate Created Workflow Trigger**

### **Trigger Setup**:

- Go to **Add New Workflow Trigger** \> Search for **Affiliate Created** \> Choose it.
- Click on **Save Trigger**.

### **How It Works**:

- This workflow is triggered whenever a new affiliate is created in the sub-account.

### **Example**:

- If you run a marketing campaign and several affiliates sign up, the moment each one is added, this trigger ensures they are automatically included in your workflows without manual intervention.

* * *

## 2\. **Add to Affiliate Manager**

### **Automation Setup**:

- Automatically add a contact to the Affiliates list in the Affiliate Manager with their status set to "active."

### **How It Works**:

- As soon as the workflow is triggered, a contact is added as an active affiliate in your system.

### **Example**:

- If a potential partner signs up, they’re immediately added to your list of active affiliates, ensuring no delay in their onboarding process.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033844788/original/43LBpDKVH8Iwr6S_lP1JjBVDN5WJKeiDcw.jpeg?1727763735)

* * *

## **3.** **Update Affiliate**

### **Automation Setup**:

- Allows you to update the affiliate status as either "active" or "inactive."
- **Supported Options**:
  - Mark as Active
  - Mark as Inactive

### **Example**:

- If an affiliate hasn’t met the activity requirements after a set period, this automation can automatically update their status to inactive.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033844790/original/cYmDOShWFpLExXBmjLj0hwNCzbEPL3bKNw.jpeg?1727763735)

## 4\. **Add to Affiliate Campaign**

### **Automation Setup**:

- Automatically add an affiliate to a specific campaign in the Affiliate Manager’s Campaigns tab. Select the campaign from a dropdown menu.

### **Example**:

- You’ve launched a new product and want all your active affiliates added to this campaign without doing it manually—this automation handles it instantly.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033844789/original/_QzifFSd0AmdXr5SY0oUdrja-FQRSRXe7Q.jpeg?1727763735)

## **5.** **Remove from Affiliate Campaign**

### **Automation Setup**:

- This option removes an affiliate from a campaign. Choose the campaign to remove them from using a dropdown menu.

### **Example**:

- If an affiliate no longer qualifies for a specific campaign, the system can automatically remove them, reducing your admin workload.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033844787/original/rcKHKfi6A2GBbJb_IyK54EMUaZht3my6iA.jpeg?1727763735)
