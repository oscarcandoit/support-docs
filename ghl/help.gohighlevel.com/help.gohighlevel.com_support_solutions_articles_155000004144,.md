# **How to Set Up GBP & Facebook Integration**

Connecting your Google Business Profile (GBP) and Facebook Page directly inside HighLevel's Listings dashboard is now easier than ever. This streamlined process eliminates the need for external logins, allowing you to manage both accounts in one place and ensure your business details, reviews, and updates stay perfectly in sync.

#### **Step 1:** CheckPrerequisites & Permissions

Before connecting, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- **Admin or Owner role** for the Google Business Profile you plan to connect

- **Facebook Page Admin** rights for the page you plan to connect

- **Browser pop-up blocker disabled** for the session

- If you've already connected either GBP or Facebook in **Social Planner**, Listings will automatically reuse the same token—no need to authenticate again


#### **Step 2:** Navigate to Listings

- From your HighLevel dashboard, go to **Reputation** in the left-hand menu

- Click on **Listings** to open the Listings dashboard

- Under **Your Account**, click the link that reads **"** **Your Entities are not set up on Google and Facebook yet.**
**Link Now"**

#### **Step 3:** Connect Google Business Profile

- Click the **Connect** button next to Connect Google Business Profile

- A Google authentication pop-up will appear

- Sign in using the Google account that manages your GBP and follow the instructions to grant access

#### **Step 4:** Connect Facebook Page

- Click the **Connect** button next to Connect Facebook Page

- A Facebook permissions pop-up will open. Select the correct Facebook Page you want to link

- Accept all permission prompts and click **Continue** to complete the setup

**Step 5:** Confirm Connection Status

- After connecting both your Google Business Profile and Facebook Page, return to the Listings dashboard

- You should now see a green “Connected” badge next to both publishers, confirming a successful integration

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does this also connect Social Planner?**

Yes. HighLevel shares one OAuth token, so linking in Listings automatically authorizes Social Planner.

**Q: Can I attach multiple Facebook Pages?**

Each location supports one Facebook Page and one GBP.

**Q: Will Social Planner posts appear on my GBP?**

Only if you include GBP as a destination when scheduling each post.

**Q: What happens if I remove a connection?**

Listings stops syncing immediately and flags the publisher as Action Required until you reconnect.

**Q: Do agency users need access to the client’s Facebook?**

No. Location-level users with Admin rights can complete the connection themselves.
