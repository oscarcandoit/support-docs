# How to Get Customer Support for WordPress Issues

Modified on: Fri, 7 Nov, 2025 at 10:21 AM

HighLevel’s WordPress Setup Guide now includes three time‑saving Quick Links—Book a Call with WordPress Customer Success, join the Product Townhall, and open the WordPress Knowledge Base inside the app. These tools speed up troubleshooting, give you direct access to roadmap conversations, and keep help one click away. This article explains what each link does and how to use them to accelerate results.

```
Note: These Quick Links are only visible to Agency Admins.

# **What is the WordPress Customer Support Upgrade?**

The WordPress Setup Guide now surfaces three support resources directly in your workflow so Agency Admins can get expert help, self‑serve answers, and real‑time product updates without leaving HighLevel.

Book a Call with WordPress Customer Success: Schedule a guided call with the WordPress CS team.
• Direct Access to Product Townhall: Join live townhalls to hear roadmap updates and share feedback.
• WordPress Knowledge Base in‑App: Open the full WordPress KB from inside HighLevel to search and self‑serve.

**Q: Who can see these Quick Links?**

Only **Agency Admins** can see the Quick Links inside the WordPress Setup Guide.

New time slots are added across most time zones. Check back soon and use the in‑app KB for immediate guidance.
