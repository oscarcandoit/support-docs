# **Overview of Adding Listings to a SaaS Plan**

The Listings add-on allows you to package business directory syncing as part of your SaaS plans. Instead of selling Listings separately, you can embed it directly into a subscription plan in the SaaS Configurator. This ensures clients automatically receive this feature when they subscribe to a plan.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Including Listings in a SaaS Plan**

Bundling Listings into your SaaS plans offers strategic upselling opportunities and simplifies feature access for your clients.

- **Simplified Packaging**: Clients automatically receive Listings when they subscribe to the plan

- **Upsell Integration**: Easily position Listings as part of a higher-tier plan to increase plan value

- **Streamlined Delivery**: Listings is provisioned automatically with no manual setup needed

- **Increased MRR**: Generates more revenue by building premium features into recurring plans

- **Easy Configuration**: Add or remove Listings from plans in just a few clicks


* * *

## **Pre-requisites**

- You must be on the pro plan and have your plans configured on the SaaS Configurator. [Click here to learn more on how to setup SaaS Mode](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001184920)

- You must have your Stripe account connected to the agency level. [Click here to learn more on how to connect Stripe to your agency dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)


```
Important: Please note that once the Agency Stripe account is connected, it can not be changed later. So please ensure that you are connecting the right Stripe account to your agency.
