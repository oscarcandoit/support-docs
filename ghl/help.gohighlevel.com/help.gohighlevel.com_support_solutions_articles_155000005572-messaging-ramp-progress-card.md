## **What’s New?**

Messaging Ramp Progress Card

- A dynamic, visual representation of your messaging limit progression, now available to all sub-accounts on the messaging ramp.
- Current Level View: See your current SMS sending tier and actionable tips to move up (e.g., “Unlock Level 2 by sending 250 messages by Jan 10, 2025”).
- Locked Levels: Preview higher levels with a lock icon and a motivational glimpse into future capabilities.
- Future Levels: Get a sneak peek at advanced messaging limits and features at upcoming levels.

## **Step-by-Step Guidance**

Helpful tooltips and a modal guide walk you through how to progress:

Send Current Limit: Max out your daily limit to trigger eligibility for the next level.

Temporary Block Notification: Hitting the daily cap will result in a 24-hour temporary pause—a normal part of the ramp-up process.

Unlocking New Levels: Once requirements are met, your SMS limit increases automatically. The card updates to reflect your new level and what’s next.

### **Reaching the Top**

Once you reach Level 8, you’ll see a congratulatory message along with next steps—usually to contact your agency owner/admin for further upgrades.

For Agency Owners/Admins: You’ll see both the Messaging Limit and Messaging Ramp Progress cards for all sub-accounts, giving you full control and visibility.

## **Who Benefits?**

- Users: Gain real-time insight into messaging progress and next steps.
- Agency Owners/Admins: Track and manage sub-account messaging limits more efficiently.

## **Where to Find It**

Go to: Subaccount View > Settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > Messaging Limit

## **Why This Matters**

- Improved Transparency: No more guessing—users now understand their SMS progression path.
- Empowered Progression: Encourages users to hit sending goals and grow their communication reach.
- Fewer Support Requests: Common questions about limits and lockouts are now addressed within the tool.

This feature is now live for all messaging ramp users—check your progress and keep growing!
