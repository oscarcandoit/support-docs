## **What's New?**

Users wanting to create one-on-one bookings were often hesitant to use the Round Robin option, as it seemed suited for multiple users. As a result, many resorted to using the Event Calendar, unaware that it is meant for physical events and does not support Zoom or Google Meet.

To overcome this confusion, reduce support tickets, and achieve parity with competitors offering 1:1 calendar types, we have introduced the Personal Booking Calendar. This feature enables users to create

personal 1:1 bookings without the complexity of a multi-user setup.

## **How to Use?**

1. Go to Calendar Settings.
2. Click on Create Calendar.
3. Choose Personal Booking and configure the calendar based on your preferences.

## **Note:**

- By default, the user who creates the calendar is automatically added as the team member, but this can be changed.
- The Personal Calendar shares all features with the Round Robin Calendar, but is limited to one team member, while Round Robin supports multiple team members.
