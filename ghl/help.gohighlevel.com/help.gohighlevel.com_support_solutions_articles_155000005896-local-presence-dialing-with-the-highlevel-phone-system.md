# Local Presence Dialing with the HighLevel Phone System

Modified on: Thu, 16 Oct, 2025 at 1:02 PM

Boost your call answer rates by presenting a local phone number to contacts based on their region. Local Presence Dialing automatically chooses the outbound caller ID that matches or is closest to the recipient’s area code, helping recipients feel more comfortable answering calls. This feature benefits businesses operating across multiple U.S. and Canadian regions, increasing engagement and reducing missed connections.

## **What is Local Presence Dialing?**

Local Presence Dialing dynamically selects the most appropriate outbound phone number/caller ID number based on a contact’s phone number area code. By leveraging region-specific numbers you’ve purchased and verified, calls appear local to recipients, significantly improving pick-up rates and fostering trust.

### **Key Points to Remember**

- Supports all area codes of a region: If calling a contact with area code 241 in Dallas,
  - If you have a phone number with the area code 241, that phone number will be used to make the call
  - If you do not have a phone number with area code 241. But you do have a Dallas number with area code 972, the 972 number will be used to make the call
  - If you do not have a phone number belonging to any area code of Dallas, the sub-account's default phone number will be used to make the call
- Sub-account's default phone number is used as the backup in case no phone numbers match the region.

- Supports USA/Canada only.

## **Key Benefits of Local Presence Dialing**

Local Presence Dialing offers several advantages that help improve engagement and build stronger trust with your contacts.

- **Higher Answer Rates**: Local caller IDs feel familiar, encouraging recipients to answer unknown numbers.

- **Improved Brand Trust**: Consistent local presence builds credibility and reduces spam perception.

- **Automated Number Selection**: Eliminates manual switching—calls automatically use the matching or regional number.

- **Regional Fallback Support**: If an exact area code match isn’t available, another number from the same region will be used.

- **Flexibility**: Can be enabled or disabled at the sub-account level, giving businesses control over who uses it.


* * *

## **How Local Presence Dialing Works**

Understanding how the feature selects caller IDs ensures you maximize its benefits in outbound calling.

- When initiating an outbound call, the system checks the contact’s phone number area code against your pool of available numbers.

- If an exact match exists, the call uses that number as the caller ID.

- If no exact match exists, the system will attempt to use a number from the same geographic region (e.g., a different Dallas area code).

- If no regional match is available, the sub-account’s default caller ID will be used.

- Number selection logic runs in real time without any user intervention.

## **How To Set Up Local Presence Dialing**

Proper setup ensures your outbound calls automatically leverage regional numbers for maximum impact.

1. Go to **Sub-account Settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > Voice Calls > Outbound Call > Default Phone Number for Outbound Calls**.

2. Toggle **Enable Local Presence Dialing** to **On**.

## **Example Use Case**

Below is an example of increasing Call Answer rates by calling contacts from the same area code automatically

**Example 1:** Calling someone in Dallas, Texas (area code of Dallas is 214)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052178492/original/00PdMp8jcNV50ULahIkfokw8WYKg1qqQag.png?1755871252)

Automatically uses a number from Dallas (if available)

**Example 2:** Calling someone with Area code 888

Of all the phone numbers available, call from the phone number with the same area code as the contact automatically, increasing trust and increasing chances of the call being answered.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if a contact’s area code doesn’t match any purchased number?**

The system falls back to the sub-account’s default business caller ID.

**Q: Can I override the auto-selection for specific calls?**

Yes. Before a call, click on **Change** on the top bar of the dialer and choose from your phone numbers. After your call, the system switches back to Local Presence Dialing. You can choose to disable Local Presence Dialing if you want to retain your choice of calling from number.

**Q: Are there limits on how many numbers I can add?**

We support all the phone numbers and Verified Caller IDs in your sub-account. No separate limits.

**Q: Does it support Verified Caller IDs?**

Yes, we do. The area code of the Verified Caller ID is taken into account when deciding which Caller ID to use for the call.

**Q: Does this work if I'm using my own Twilio account?**

Yes, Local Presence Dialing works with your own Twilio account too.

**Q: Can I disable Local Presence Dialing for specific sub-accounts or users?**

Local Presence Dialing can be disabled for the sub-accounts but not for individual users.

**Q: Is this feature available internationally?**

Local Presence Dialing is supported only in the U.S. and Canada at this time.

**Q: Does Local Presence Dialing improve call answer rates automatically?**

Presenting a familiar local number increases the likelihood that recipients will answer but there are no guarantees.
