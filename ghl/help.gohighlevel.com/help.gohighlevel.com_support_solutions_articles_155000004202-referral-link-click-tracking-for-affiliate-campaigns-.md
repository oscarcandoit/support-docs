## **What’s New?**

Now, both you and your affiliates can gain deeper insights into campaign performance by tracking referral link clicks. With this feature, clicks are now displayed across various key areas:

- Affiliate Manager Dashboard

- Affiliate List

- Affiliate Profile Page

- Affiliate Portal (for affiliates to monitor their own click performance)


* * *

## **How It Works**

You can track clicks in real time on the Affiliate Manager Dashboard, Affiliate List, and Affiliate Profile Page, while affiliates can view their own click data directly in their Affiliate Portal.

```
Note: Only Unique Link Clicks are tracked.
```

* * *

## **Why it Matters**

This update gives you a clearer understanding of how well your affiliates’ referral links are performing, allowing for better optimization of campaigns. For affiliates, the ability to see click metrics empowers them to refine their promotion strategies and maximize success.
