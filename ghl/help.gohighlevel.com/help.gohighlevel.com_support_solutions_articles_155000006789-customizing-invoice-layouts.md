# **What is Invoice Layout Customization?**

Invoice Layout Customization lets you control the visual design and section wording of your invoices at the sub-account level. Instead of one fixed template, you can adjust branding, business and contact sections, and line-item labels so every invoice reflects your brand and the specifics of your industry.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Invoice Layout Customization**

- **Brand Consistency:** Align colors and wording with your brand for a polished, trustworthy invoice.

- **Clarity for Clients:** Rename sections and labels so customers instantly recognize what they’re seeing.

- **Flexibility:** Show or hide fields and add up to 3 custom values in Business Information to fit regional or industry needs.

- **Efficiency:** Edit once and reuse, your saved layout appears in the invoice preview and PDFs.


* * *

## **Branding Settings**

Branding controls shape first impressions by adjusting the pay button’s color, border, and text. These choices help reinforce your brand and set the right context (e.g., “Pay” vs. “Donate”).

**What you can customize:**

- Pay Button Color (use the color picker)

- Border Color (use the color picker)

- Button Text (e.g., change **Pay** to **Donate**)

* * *

## **Business Information**

Business Information identifies who is issuing the invoice. Toggling fields or adding custom values keeps your documents compliant across regions while avoiding clutter.

**What you can do:**

- Show/Hide standard fields like Company Name, Phone, Address, Tax IDs.

- Add up to 3 custom values (e.g., Company Registration, VAT/GST, Website).

- Reorder or remove custom values as needs change (delete to remove).

```
Tip: Unchecked fields are hidden from recipients, but your team can still edit their values while creating an invoice.
```

* * *

## **Contact Information**

This area defines the recipient block (e.g., “Billed to” or “Shipping details”). Renaming the section improves clarity for your use case (nonprofit, shipping-heavy, B2B, etc.).

**What you can do:**

- Rename the section header (e.g., **Billed to** → **Shipping details**).

- Add custom fields to capture extra recipient details.

* * *

## **Invoice Information**

Invoice Information covers core document details such as invoice number and dates. Keeping only what you need simplifies the layout for customers.

**What you can do:**

- Show/Hide **Invoice Number**, **Issue Date**, **Due Date**, and similar fields.


- Keep internal fields editable during invoice creation even if they’re hidden on the recipient view.

* * *

## **Labels**

Labels define the column headers for your line items, what customers read at a glance. Clear labels reduce questions and accelerate payment.

**What you can do:**

- Rename column headers (e.g., Item Name → Product Name).

- Show/Hide Price, Quantity, Tax, Subtotal, etc.

- Respect character counters (e.g., up to 75 characters) to avoid wrapping.

```
Tip: If you uncheck a label, that column is hidden from recipients; your team can still enter values during invoice creation.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do these changes apply to all invoices in my sub-account?**

Yes. Layout customizations are saved at the sub-account level and used for invoices you create in that sub-account.

**Q: Will previously sent PDFs update after I change the layout?**

No. Previously delivered PDFs won’t change automatically. Create a fresh PDF or resend the invoice so recipients see your latest layout.

**Q: Can I hide a column but still enter those values when creating an invoice?**

Yes. Hiding a label only hides it from the recipient view; your team can still edit the values during invoice creation.

**Q: How many custom values can I add to Business Information?**

Up to **3** custom values.

**Q: Do layout changes appear in downloaded or emailed PDFs?**

Yes. PDFs reflect the saved layout when you generate or resend them. See [PDF Generation for Invoices and Receipts](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005216) for details.
