# **Why This Matters**

Associations make your CRM more powerful and connected. Here’s why they matter:

- Gain a **360° view** of every Opportunity and its related data.

- Mirror **real business relationships**—such as linking customers, properties, or events to deals.

- Reduce time spent navigating across records by managing related information from one screen.

- Use **association data** in workflows, reports, and exports to personalize automation and improve tracking.


* * *

## **Key Highlights**

- Supports **one-to-one**, **one-to-many**, **many-to-one**, and **many-to-many** relationships.

- Create and manage associations directly from **Opportunities** or **Custom Object panels**.

- Search for and link existing records instantly—no need to navigate away from your workflow.

- View associated records across **Opportunity Details**, **Kanban cards**, and **List Views**.

- Add association fields to layouts via **Manage Fields → Association Label (Object Type)** for better visibility and reporting.


* * *

## **How to Create an Association**

#### **Step 1:**Open the Associations Tab

1. Go to **Settings → Custom Objects → \[Your Object\]**.

2. Click on the **Associations** tab at the top of the screen.

3. Click **Create Association** to start configuring a new link between your Custom Object and Opportunities.

#### **Step 2:** Configure the Association

When the **Create Association** panel opens:

1. **Select the object** to associate with (for example, _Opportunities_).

2. **Name your association**:

   - Use a **Single Label** (e.g., “Deal”) if both objects share the same reference.

   - Use a **Pair of Labels** (e.g., “Buyer ↔ Seller”) if each side should show a unique name.
3. **Configure the relationship type**:

   - **One-to-One:** Each record can connect to only one record on the other side.

   - **One-to-Many / Many-to-One:** One record connects to multiple others.

   - **Many-to-Many:** Unlimited connections both ways.
4. (Optional) Set **record limits** to restrict the number of connections per record (up to 1,000).

5. Review the **Preview** panel to confirm your setup, then click **Save**.

## **Managing Associations from Opportunities**

Once your association is created, you can link records directly from the Opportunity.

1. Open any **Opportunity record**.

2. Navigate to the **Associated Objects** tab in the left-hand panel.

3. Click **\+ Associate new \[Object\]**.

4. Search and select the Custom Object you want to link.

5. Choose the relevant **label** (such as “Deal” or “Property”), then click **Save**.


Your association will appear immediately under its corresponding category (e.g., Contacts, Events, Properties).

You can click any associated record to open it in a side panel for quick edits or to view additional details without leaving the Opportunity screen.

## **Viewing Associations in the CRM**

After setting up associations, they appear throughout your CRM to improve visibility and workflow efficiency.

### **Opportunity Details**

All linked Custom Objects are displayed in the **Associated Objects** panel of an Opportunity. This gives users direct access to related data (such as linked Events or Contacts) in one view.

### **Kanban View**

In the **Kanban view**, you can display associations directly on Opportunity cards.

To do this:

1. Go to **Opportunities → Manage Fields**.

2. Add the field **Association Label (Object Type)** to your card layout.





This helps sales teams quickly identify which Events, Properties, or Objects are tied to each Opportunity.

### **List View**

In the **List view**, you can add the same association field as a column to display all linked records in a single glance.

This is especially useful for bulk reviews, filtering, and CSV exports.

* * *

## **Tips**

- You can create up to **10 unique labels** between each pair of objects.

- Each label supports **up to 1,000 linked records** per side.

- **Deleting** an Opportunity or Custom Object will automatically remove its associations.

- **API support** for associations will be added in future updates.

- To include association data in **exports or reports**, add the association field through _Manage Fields_.


* * *

## **Example Use Cases**

#### **Real Estate**

Link multiple “Property” Custom Objects to a single “Opportunity (Buyer)” to see all properties a client is interested in. This gives agents quick visibility into each buyer’s options.

#### **Events**

Connect “Event” Custom Objects with their related “Sponsorship Deal” Opportunities. This setup helps event managers understand which deals are tied to each event.

#### **Insurance**

Associate “Policy” or “Quote” Custom Objects to the corresponding Opportunities. Agents can easily track the policy, quote, and opportunity all from a single view.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I limit an Opportunity to only one Custom Object?**

Yes. When configuring your relationship, choose _One-to-One_ or set _One-to-N_ with N = 1.

**Q: Will renaming a label break existing associations?**

No. Renaming only changes the display label; the internal link remains intact.

**Q: Can I bulk import associations?**

Not yet. Associations must currently be created manually or via workflows.

**Q: Can I include associations in reports and exports?**

Yes. Once the field is added in _Manage Fields_, it will appear in exports and reporting data.

**Q: What happens if I delete a record?**

When an Opportunity or Custom Object is deleted, all of its associated links are automatically removed to maintain data integrity.
