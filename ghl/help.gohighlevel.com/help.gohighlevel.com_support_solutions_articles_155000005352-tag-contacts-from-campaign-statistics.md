# Tag Contacts from Campaign Statistics

Modified on: Tue, 27 May, 2025 at 2:05 AM

Segmenting contacts just got easier! You can now **add and automate tags directly from your campaign statistics page** based on interactions like opens and clicks. No more pre-planning or tedious manual work.

**Overview**

You can now tag contacts based on their interaction with a campaign (opens, clicks, etc.) directly from the campaign’s statistics page. This allows you to instantly segment and personalise your follow-ups—without setting up tags in advance. Plus, with **auto-tagging**, new contacts who engage with your campaign will be tagged automatically in real-time, keeping your segments updated effortlessly.

**Benefits**

Previously, tagging was only available through pre-planned workflows or manual bulk actions. This update makes it easier to:

- **Instant Segmentation**: No need to plan ahead—segment post-campaign.
- **Automated Tagging**: New interactions get tagged without manual effort.
- **Trackable Logs**: Keep a clean history of tag actions.
- **Multi-Tagging**: Apply multiple tags for more nuanced segmentation.

### **What’s New**

- **Tag by Interaction:** Apply tags to contacts who opened, clicked, or engaged—right from the stats page.
- **Auto-Tag Future Interactions:** Automatically tag new contacts who interact with the campaign.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

**1\. Tag Contacts by Interaction**

1. Go to **Marketing → Email Campaigns**.
2. Find a **sent campaign** and click the **3-dot menu → Statistics**.
3. Click **Load More** to view interaction data (Opened, Clicked, etc.).
4. Choose an interaction category (e.g., Opened).
5. Select the contacts you want to tag.
6. Click **Add Tags**, type your desired tag, and apply.

**2\. Auto-Tag Future Interactions**

1. In the interaction category (e.g., Opened), select **All**.
2. Click **Add Tags** and enter your tag(s).
3. Enable the **Auto-Tag Future Interactions** toggle.

**3\. Track Tags and Logs**

- All manual tagging is visible in **Tags** and **Bulk Actions**.
- Auto-tagged contacts will not appear in the Bulk Actions log but will be tagged automatically as they interact.

### **Limitations**

- Auto-tagging is not available for :
1. Invalid contacts
2. Order Details lists
- All actions are logged in the **Bulk Actions** tab apart from future auto-tagging.

**FAQs**

**Q1: Can I remove tags using this feature?**

**A:** No. This tool currently only supports adding tags. You can remove tags manually via Contacts or Tags settings.

**Q2: What happens if I apply the same tag again?**

**A:** Duplicate tags are ignored. A contact won’t get tagged multiple times with the same tag.

**Q3: Can I use this with A/B test campaigns?**

**A:**Yes, tagging works with A/B test campaigns.****

**Q4: How many tags can I apply at once?**

**A: **M****ultiple tags can be applied just like in Contacts sections.****

**Q5: Where will i see the log data?**

**A: **You will see the log data within Statistics interface.****
