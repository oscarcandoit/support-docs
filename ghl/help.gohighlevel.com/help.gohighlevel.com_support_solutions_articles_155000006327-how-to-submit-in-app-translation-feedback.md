# **What is the Translation Feedback Feature?**

Report Translation Feedback is a built-in feature that surfaces a **report icon in the top bar** so eligible users can submit translation issues without leaving the current page. Submissions help the product team quickly identify strings that need review, improving accuracy and consistency across the platform.

```
Note: The feature is not visible when the platform language is set to English.
```

- Submit feedback **from the page where you see the issue.**

- Attach a **screenshot** to highlight the exact string.

- Your report is routed for review; you’ll be **notified when it’s fixed.**


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Translation Feedback Feature**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide when to use the in-app report versus opening a general support ticket.

- **Real-time capture**: Report issues in the moment, from the exact screen you’re using.

- **Lower effort**: Avoid external tickets for routine translation fixes.

- **Higher quality**: Add screenshots so reviewers can pinpoint the exact string.

- **Faster iteration**: Centralized reports streamline localization improvements.
