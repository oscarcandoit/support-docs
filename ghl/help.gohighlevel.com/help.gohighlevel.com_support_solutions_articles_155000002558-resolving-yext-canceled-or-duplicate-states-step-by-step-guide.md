# Resolving Yext Canceled or Duplicate States – Step-by-Step Guide

Modified on: Thu, 27 Jun, 2024 at 6:23 AM

Encountering Yext in a duplicate or canceled state can be puzzling, but worry not, for we are here to guide you through the process with ease and clarity.

If it appears that your sub-account or business client is endeavoring to subscribe to Yext, only to discover an existing active presence on Yext through another third party.

To swiftly resolve this matter, we kindly request your attention to the following steps:

1. Begin by logging into the Sub Account/Location portal.
2. Navigate to the Reputation section and proceed to the Listings page.
3. Here, you'll find a highlighted link that will direct you to an email pre-addressed with the Yext GHL in CC. Kindly include pertinent details such as business name, address, and phone number in the email body for the Yext support team to investigate the issue thoroughly.

Please note that if necessary, we may require confirmation from Yext regarding the resubmission of the Yext request for the sub-account. This precautionary step is essential due to the potential complexities involved when canceling Yext services through a third-party provider.

Should you require any further assistance or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
