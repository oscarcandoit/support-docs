# **What is Documents & Contracts?**

Documents & Contracts is a built-in tool under the **Payments** section in HighLevel that enables businesses to manage legally binding agreements. You can start with a blank document, upload an existing PDF, or use a prebuilt template. It also supports e-signatures, payment collection, automated triggers, and full audit tracking.

This feature is designed to help agencies, small businesses, and service providers streamline client agreements, eliminate paperwork, and close deals faster.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Documents & Contracts**

- **Centralized Dashboard**: Manage all your contracts and proposals in one organized place under Payments. This reduces time spent searching across different tools and ensures your team always knows the status of every document.

- **Custom Templates**: Reuse prebuilt templates for recurring agreements like service contracts or proposals. This speeds up document creation while ensuring consistency and professionalism across clients.

- **E-Signatures with Audit Trail**: Collect legally binding signatures online, with a certificate that records signer details, IP address, and timestamps. This provides legal protection while making the signing process easy for clients.

- **Integrated Payments**: Add one-time or recurring payments directly inside your contracts. This allows you to close deals and collect revenue instantly, without requiring a separate invoicing process.

- **Workflow Automation**: Trigger actions when a document is created, sent, viewed, or signed. This keeps deals moving forward automatically, reducing manual follow-ups and improving conversion rates.

# **Overview of the Documents & Contracts Dashboard**

The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of all contracts, estimates, and proposals. This is your control center for managing agreements.

**Accessing the Dashboard**

To manage all agreements, go to **Payments → Documents & Contracts** from the left menu. From the dropdown, select **All Documents & Contracts** to view every draft, sent, completed, or archived document in one place.

**Date Filter**

You can narrow down results by selecting a start and end date from the calendar. This is especially useful when tracking contracts created during a specific billing cycle or reviewing proposals sent within a certain timeframe.

**Document Status and Dashboard Columns**

- The dashboard organizes your contracts and proposals into tabs: **Draft, Waiting for others, Completed, Payments, and Archived**. These tabs make it easy to track progress — for example, you can quickly see which clients still need to sign under _Waiting for others_.

- Each document row displays important details including **Title, Status, Customer, Date Modified, and Value**. This lets you quickly assess which agreements are active, which ones need follow-up, and which are complete or archived for record-keeping.

- A three-dot menu next to each record provides quick actions like **View, Clone, Mark as Completed, Download PDF, Convert to Template, Share via Link, Move to Draft, or Mark as Declined**.

# **Creating New Documents**

You can create documents in three ways, depending on your needs.

Click the **\+ New** button at the top right of the dashboard. Choose from:

- **New Document**: Start from scratch using the editor. Example: Build a fresh proposal with text blocks, pricing tables, and video embeds.

- **Upload Existing PDF**: Import a PDF and overlay signature or text fields. Example: A coaching contract uploaded for client e-signature.

- **Import from Template Library**: Choose from existing templates. Example: A cleaning business reuses its standard service agreement.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if a client partially signs but doesn’t complete the document?**

If multiple signers are assigned and only some complete their fields, the document remains in **Waiting for others**. You can remind incomplete signers by resending from the dashboard. The document won’t move to Completed until every required signer finishes.

**Q: How secure are e-signatures and payment details inside documents?**

HighLevel applies SSL encryption to all documents and payment data. Each signature generates a certificate with IP address, email, and timestamp. Payment information is processed securely through your integrated payment provider and never stored in HighLevel.

**Q: Can I create conditional content in documents (e.g., show different pricing tables depending on the client)?**

Currently, conditional logic inside documents is not supported. Each document is static once created. If you need variations, create multiple templates or use workflows to send different templates based on conditions.

**Q: What happens if I edit a template after sending a document?**

Editing a template does not affect documents already sent. Any changes will only apply to future documents created from that template. This ensures legal integrity for already signed or pending agreements.

**Q: Can I accept multiple payment methods in one document?**

Yes, you can configure documents to accept multiple payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) if those gateways are connected to your account. Recipients can choose their preferred method at checkout.

**Q: How do expiry dates work with documents?**

You can add an expiry date from the document action menu. Once the date passes, the document automatically moves to **Expired** and can no longer be signed. This is useful for time-limited offers or proposals.

**Q: Can workflows trigger based on specific template usage?**

Yes, workflows can filter by both **Document Status** and **Template Name**. For example, you could send a reminder only when a specific “Service Agreement” template remains unsigned for more than 3 days.
