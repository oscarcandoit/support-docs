# Free vs Premium Prospecting in GoHighLevel – Complete Guide for Agencies

Modified on: Fri, 6 Jun, 2025 at 3:11 AM

## What is Prospecting?

**Prospecting** is the process of identifying and evaluating potential customers who are likely to benefit from your services. In GoHighLevel, Prospecting is an intelligent lead generation tool that helps you **discover high-quality leads**, analyze their **marketing readiness**, and uncover **opportunities to pitch your services** — all from within your dashboard.

* * *

## What is GoHighLevel Prospecting?

GoHighLevel’s Prospecting tool is built to **automate and simplify your lead generation** efforts. Instead of manually searching for businesses and running audits, you can now:

- **Find and evaluate leads** using business data and AI

- **Generate audit reports** for each lead, showcasing gaps in their marketing presence

- Use this data to **upsell services**, demonstrate your value, and build your pipeline faster


You can access Prospecting in **two ways**:

1. **Basic (Free Tier)**

2. **Premium (Paid Subscription)**
