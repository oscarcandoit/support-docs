**Follow the steps below to automatically append the email signature to email event templates**

01. Click Marketing
02. Click Campaigns
03. Click the name of a campaign to open up the campaign (or create a new campaign if you don't already have one)
04. Click Campaign Configurations
05. Use the drop down in the Users field to assign user(s) to the campaign
06. Click Save
07. Click Edit on an email event within the campaign (or add an email event)
08. Within the email template click Custom Values -> User -> Signature. Make sure the code given is at the bottom of the email template (where you would expect to see an email signature)
09. Click Save
10. Make sure the campaign is Published if you want to be able to add contacts to it (top right drop down within the campaign)

Done! Now all of the contacts that get put into this campaign will be assigned to the user(s) assigned to the campaign and will receive the email signature within the email event pertaining to the user they were assigned.

If email signatures are not working, make sure that you are logged in as the user with the signature.

If you are logged in as an agency trying to send an email on behalf of the user, the user signature will not work.

However, the workaround is to send the email through the workflow/campaign instead of sending them manually. You can use the other methods listed here aside from the conversation manual way:
