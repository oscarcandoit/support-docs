# **What is the QR Code Element?**

The QR Code element is an element in the HighLevel Page Builder that renders a scannable code linked to any supported destination URL (for example, a funnel/website page, calendar, form, survey, payment link, or external URL). It lets you select an existing QR from your library or create/edit one inline without leaving the builder.

You can place this element anywhere on your page, point it to a destination, and visitors can scan it with their phone camera (or click on it) to go there instantly.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of QR Code Element**

- **Inline Creation/Editing**: Create a new QR or edit the selected one directly from the builder.

- **Clear Destination**: See the URL the QR will open, so you can confirm it’s correct before publishing.

- **Deleted Detection**: If the previously selected QR was removed from your library, you’re prompted to pick or create a new one.

- **Cross‑Location Awareness**: Labels flag QR codes that belong to a different location, preventing confusion.

- **On‑Canvas control**: Resize and position the element to fit your layout for desktop and mobile.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Where do QR codes live outside the Page Builder?**

They are stored in your QR library for the current location. You can access and manage them from the QR builder screens and from the inline editor in the element.

**Q: Do I need to republish after editing a QR’s destination?**

Yes. After updating the QR or swapping the selected QR in the element, publish/update the page so visitors get the latest destination.

**Q: What if the QR I previously selected was deleted?**

The element will prompt you to pick another QR or create a new one. Choose a replacement and republish.

**Q: Can I use a QR from another location?**

Cross‑location QRs are flagged for clarity. For consistency and control, create/select a QR owned by the current location.
