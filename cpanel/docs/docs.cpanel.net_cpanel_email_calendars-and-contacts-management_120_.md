Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

The _Calendars and Contacts Management_ interface allows you to display, create, delete, and rename calendars and address books.

Note:

This feature also appears in the [Webmail interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/the-webmail-interface/).

- _Description_ — A description of the calendar or address book.
- _Actions_ — The available actions to perform on the calendar or address book.

## The Collection Editor interface

Use the _Collection Editor_ interface to create, delete, or rename calendars and address books. In this interface, a [collection](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#collection) is a set of either events in a calendar or contacts in an address book.
