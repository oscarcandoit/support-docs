Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

Experimental:

_Manage Team_ is an experimental feature. We do **not** recommend using this feature in production environments. It is currently under development and is **only** available to a limited number of cPanel & WHM customers. It will be available for testing in future releases. For more information about the development of _Manage Team_, read our [Manage Team roadmap](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/roadmaps/manage-team-roadmap).

To edit a team user, click _Edit User_ in the [_Manage Team_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team) interface’s _List Team_ table. A new interface will appear. It displays the various settings for a team user, such as their username, password, role, and other settings.

## Edit a Team User

To edit a team user, change the desired settings:

1. In the _Basic Information_ section, enter a new username for the existing team user in the _Username_ text box. The username will always precede the cPanel account’s primary domain (for example, `user@example.com`).
2. In the _Notes_ text box, enter any notes related to the team user. The text box can contain up to 100 characters. This text box is optional.
3. In the _Security Information_ section, enter a secure password in the _Password_ text box to reset the team user’s password. Or, click _Send a Password Reset Email_ to send the team user an email to allow them to reset their password. For information on requirements for secure passwords, read our [_Password & Security_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/password-and-security/) documentation.

   - If desired, click _Generate_ to let the system create a secure password for you. The system will reveal this password. You can also click the more icon (![More](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/moreicon.png)) to select password complexity settings. The system will use these settings when it generates a new password.
4. Enter the team user’s new email address in the _Contact Email_ text box.
5. In the _User Settings_ section, select the desired options from the menu to assign roles to a team user. [_Roles_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team/#roles) are a set of privileges, features, files, or tasks that a team user can use.

Click _Save_ to save the changes to the team user and return to the _Manage Team_ interface. You can click _Go Back_ to cancel this action and return to the _Manage Team_ interface.
