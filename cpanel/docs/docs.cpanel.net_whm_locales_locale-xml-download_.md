Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface allows you download an existing locale (language) in XML format. You **must** download the XML file in order to edit the cPanel interface’s locale.

## How to download a locale

To download a locale, perform the following steps:

1. Select the locale that you wish to download from the _Choose Locale_ menu.

2. Click _Download XML_ to download the locale in a legacy XML format, or click _Download XLF_ to download the locale in [XLIFF 1.2 (XML Localization Interchange File Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) format.


Note:

To rebuild your system’s list of locales, click _rebuild the locale databases_ at the bottom of the interface.
