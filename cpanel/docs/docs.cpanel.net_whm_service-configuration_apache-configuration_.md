Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

This collection of features allows you to configure Apache. Apache functions as your web server software and handles HTTP requests.

- [_Global Configuration_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/global-configuration/) — This interface allows you to adjust several advanced features of the Apache web server.

- [_DirectoryIndex Priority_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/directoryindex-priority/) — This interface allows you to specify filenames that Apache will recognize and display as index pages.

- [_Include Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/include-editor/) — This interface allows you to add other configuration files to your Apache configuration file ( _httpd.conf_).

- [_Reserved IP Address Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/reserved-ip-address-editor/) — This interface allows you to configure Apache to ignore HTTP requests on specific IP addresses. Use this feature if you wish to prevent the assignment of specific IP addresses to new accounts.

- [_Memory Usage Restrictions_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/memory-usage-restrictions/) — This interface allows you to calculate and set a new Apache memory limit. Setting a process memory limit increases the stability of your server, but may reduce performance slightly. This limit applies to each Apache process, not to all Apache processes combined.

- [_Log Rotation_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/log-rotation/) — This interface allows you to specify which Apache log files cPanel’s _cpanellogd_ daemon should manipulate.

- [_Piped Log Configuration_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/piped-log-configuration/) — This interface configures Apache to use a single target for all virtual host access and bandwidth logs.
