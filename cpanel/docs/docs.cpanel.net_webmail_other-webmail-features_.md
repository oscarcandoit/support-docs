## Webmail — Other Features

_Valid for versions 84 through the latest version_

#### Version:

#### [84](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/)

Last modified: _2025 June 9_

* * *

## Overview

The features in this section perform different actions in Webmail:

- [Configure Mail Client](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#configure-mail-client)
- [Manage Disk Usage](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#manage-disk-usage)
- [Mailing Lists](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#mailing-lists)
- [Search Index](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#search-index)
- [Track Delivery](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#track-delivery)

## Configure Mail Client

Use this interface to configure a desktop mail client (for example, macOS® Mail.app® for Mojave). Mail clients require specific information. The options below provide this information. Alternatively you can use the information under _Mail Client Manual Settings_.

#### Mail Client Automatic Configuration Scripts

This interface has information and tools to help you configure your mail client.

- To download a tool that automatically configures your mail client, click the desired protocol. Then, follow the displayed directions.
- To manually configure your mail client, use the information under _Mail Client Manual Settings_. We **strongly** recommend that you use the displayed SSL/TLS settings.

Note:

You can read your email messages in a mail program (for example, Thunderbird®). You can download your messages with one of two protocols, IMAP and POP3. We recommend that you use the IMAP protocol to download email to a mail program (mail client). POP3 protocol does not update the server when you read mail. Because of this, mail that you viewed in the mail client will appear unread in the _Webmail_ interface.

#### Mail Client Manual Settings

If you don’t see your mail client in the list, you can configure it using the manual settings. Use the information listed in this section and follow your mail client’s instructions for manual setup.

#### Email Instructions

You can also send the manual configuration settings as an email. To send the email, enter the recipient address in the _Email Instructions_ text box and click _Send_.

## Manage Disk Usage

Use this interface to free disk space. You can view all of your mailboxes and remove old or large messages.

#### Search

Use the _Search_ text box to search for specific mailbox names.

#### The mailbox table

The mailbox table contains a list of mailboxes. You can sort this information by the name, the number of messages, or disk usage.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Mailbox Name_ | The name of the mailbox. |
| _\# of Messages_ | The number of messages for the address or in the mailbox folder. |
| _Disk Usage_ | The disk usage for each address or mailbox, in bytes, kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), or gigabytes (GB). |
| _Actions_ | The actions available for the mailbox. |

#### Remove messages

Note:

Select _Custom query …_ to customize your removal option. For more information, read Dovecot’s [Search Query Format](https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Tools/Doveadm/SearchQuery) documentation.

To remove messages, perform the following steps:

1. Click _Manage_.
2. Select a removal option from the menu.
3. Click _Delete Permanently_.

## Mailing Lists

Mailing lists allow you to use a single address to send mail to multiple email addresses.

Note:

- cPanel handles mailing lists with the third-party Mailman application. For more information, read the [Mailman](http://www.list.org/docs.html) documentation.
- For this interface to display, your hosting provider must enable this feature.
- Even after your hosting provider enables the feature, the Mailman service will not start until the server hosts at least one mailing list.

#### View current mailing lists

The _Current Lists_ section of the interface displays the mailing lists on the account. To search for a mailing list, enter a keyword in the _Search_ text box.

The following information describes the _Current Lists_ table:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _List Name_ | The mailing list’s full email address. |
| _Usage_ | The amount of disk space that the mailing list uses. |
| _Access_ | The user’s level of access to the mailing list. <br>- _Private_ — Private archives exist for this mailing list. The administrator **must** approve subscriptions, and the _Mailman_ interface does not display the mailing list.<br>- _Public_ — Public archives exist for this mailing list. The subscriptions are open and the _Mailman_ interface displays the list. |
| _Admin_ | A delimited-by-rows list of email addresses of the mailing list administrators. |
| _Functions_ | Administrative functions for the mailing list (see below). |

### Manage a mailing list

To manage a mailing list, perform the following steps:

1. In the _Current Lists_ section of the interface, scroll to the name of the mailing list.

   - You can also enter a keyword in the _Search_ box and click _Go_.
2. In the _Functions_ column, click _Manage_ next to the name of the mailing list.

Note:

The system logs you in to the mailing list management interface automatically. However, if you go directly to the Mailman URL or prefer to use the email-based management functions, you must use the administrator password.


After the Mailman management interface appears, you can define the various configuration options.

For more information about available Mailman configuration options, read the [Mailman](http://www.list.org/docs.html) documentation.

#### Enable spam filters for a mailing list

Note:

Mailman’s _Spam Filters_ feature requires Apache SpamAssassin™. To enable Apache SpamAssassin™ for your cPanel account, select _Enable Apache SpamAssassin_ in cPanel’s [_Spam Filters_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/spam-filters/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Mail » Spam Filters_). If you do not have a cPanel account, ask your hosting provider to enable Apache SpamAssassin.

To enable spam filters for a mailing list, perform the following steps:

1. In the _Current Lists_ section, scroll to the name of the mailing list.

   - You can also enter a keyword in the _Search_ box and click _Go_.
2. In the _Functions_ column, click _Manage_ next to the name of the mailing list.
3. In the _Configuration Categories_ section at the top, click _Privacy options_.
4. Click _Spam filters_.
5. Enter the filter rules that you wish to apply. For more information, read our [How to Create Mail Filter Rules For Mailing Lists](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/email/how-to-create-mail-filter-rules-for-mailing-lists/) documentation.
6. Click _Submit Your Changes_.
For more information on Mailman’s _Spam Filters_ feature, read the [Mailman](http://www.list.org/docs.html) documentation.

## Search Index

Important:

For this interface to appear, your hosting provider **must** enable this feature.

Use this interface to reindex the messages in your email account. This performs a full text search (FTS) scan on the messages and makes the search function in your email client faster. This is especially useful if you have a large number of messages in your inbox.

To reindex the messages in your email account, click _Reindex_. The system will initiate a reindex of your email messages.

## Track Delivery

Use this interface to view email message delivery reports. You can also use this interface to trace a message’s delivery route or find delivery problems.

#### Search

The _Recipient Email (optional)_ text box lets you filter the [_Delivery Report_](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#delivery-report) table results to a specific email address. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Enter an email address in the _Recipient Email (optional)_ text box.
2. Click _Run Report_. The system will filter the _Delivery Report_ table to **only** display results for the recipient email address. It will also display the [_Email Address Trace_](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/other-webmail-features/#email-address-trace) diagram.

To reset the _Delivery Report_ table’s results, perform the following steps:

1. Remove the email address from the _Recipient Email (optional)_ text box.
2. Click _Run Report_. This will remove the filter from the _Delivery Report_ table and display **all** email message results.






Note:





This will **not** reset the Email Server Trace diagram.


You can use the following options to filter the results of the Delivery Report table:

- _Show Blocked & Failed_ — This option will filter the table to only display delivery failures.
- _Show All_ — Display all deliveries. This will also update the _Recipient Email (optional)_ search results.

### Delivery Report

Important:

Your hosting provider **must** enable this feature for the _Delivery Report_ table to display messages.

By default, the table lists the 250 most recent messages to and from your Webmail account’s mailboxes. This includes every delivery success and failure. The table sorts the data into the following columns by default:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Event_ | An icon that indicates the message’s delivery status: <br>- ![Success icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-success-84.png) — The system delivered the message.<br>- ![Unknown delivery status icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-unknown-84.png) — The message’s status is unknown, or delivery is in progress.<br>- ![Deferred message icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-deferred-84.png) — The system deferred the message.<br>- ![Error icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-delivery-error-84.png) — The message encountered a delivery error.<br>- ![Archived message icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-archived-84.png) — The system archived the message.<br>- ![Rejected message icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-rejected-84.png) — The system rejected and discarded the message at Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) time. This can occur when the sender’s server does not use a secure configuration or the server is on a [Real-time Blackhole List (RBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL).<br>- ![Filtered message icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-filtered-84.png) — The mail server accepted the message but it did not deliver the message to the recipient’s inbox. This can occur when spam software filters a message or if a recipient has custom email filters. |
| _From Address_ | The email address on your system that sent the message. |
| _Sender_ | The sender’s Webmail username. |
| _Sent Time_ | The date and time when the user sent the message. |
| _Spam Score_ | The message’s Apache SpamAssassin™ score. |
| _Recipient_ | The email address to which the user sent the message. |
| _Result_ | A message that describes the delivery results. |
| _Actions_ | Click the information icon (![Info icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/track-delivery-information-84.png)) to view and print information about the message. This information includes information such as a message’s sender, recipient, and username. |

The system retains this data for the number of days as specified by your hosting provider.

### Email Address Trace

This diagram displays how the system would send an email message to the given email address. It traces how the local system routes a message. You can use this feature to find potential problems with message delivery. Each icon displays information about the message’s delivery path:

Note:

The following icons may vary from those that your system uses.
