Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface allows you to control whether Interface Analytics collects data about your server and its accounts. If you enable Interface Analytics, WebPros International, LLC will collect anonymized data about user behavior.

Important:

- You can’t disable Configuration Analytics from this interface. Configuration Analytics is mandatory for all servers.

- The data that we collect via these features allows us to make improvements to cPanel & WHM and better understand our customers. For more information about how we use this data, read our [cPanel Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics/) documentation.


## Interface Analytics

Interface Analytics collects data about how users navigate through and interact with the cPanel, WHM, and Webmail interfaces. Click the _Interface Analytics_ toggle to enable or disable Interface Analytics server-wide.

Note:

- Interface Analytics defaults to _Enabled_ server-wide for the `root` account of servers with [trial licenses](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-sign-up-for-a-trial-license/).

- If the server owner converts the trial license to a paid license, data collection will continue for the `root` account. The server owner can disable this data collection if they wish.

- After you enable Interface Analytics at the server level, we still do **not** gather an individual account’s data until that user specifically enables data collection for their account.

- Users can enable or disable data collection at the account level via the graph icon (![graph icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/cpanel-analytics-graph-icon.png)) on the right side of each interface.
