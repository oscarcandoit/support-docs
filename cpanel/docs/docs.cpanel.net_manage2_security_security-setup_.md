## Security Setup

Last modified: _2020 April 7_

* * *

## Overview

The _Security Setup_ interface allows you to configure your Manage2 account’s security questions. If you access your Manage2 account from an IP address range that exists outside of your normal IP address range, you **must** answer these questions correctly in order to log in.

## Configure security questions

To configure your account’s security questions, perform the following steps:

1. For each _Question_ menu, select a unique security question.
2. For each _Answer_ text box, enter the desired answer for that question.
3. Click _Update_.
