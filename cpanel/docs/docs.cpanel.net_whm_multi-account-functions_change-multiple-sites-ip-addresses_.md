Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface allows you to change the IP addresses of multiple accounts at the same time. This feature is useful, for example, when a reseller transfers an account to another reseller.

## Change multiple IP addresses

To change more than one IP address at the same time, perform the following steps:

1. Select the checkboxes for the domains for which you wish to change IP addresses.
2. Click _Change IPs of Selected Accounts_.
3. Select the new IP address for each domain from the menu.
4. Click _Change IPs_.






Warning:




Because nameservers do not update their DNS information instantly, changing a domain’s IP address may temporarily prevent some visitors from accessing that domain.
