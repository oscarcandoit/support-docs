## How to Identify Your Registrar

Last modified: _2025 June 6_

* * *

## Overview

A domain registrar manages the reservation of domain names. When you purchase a domain name through a registrar, they allow you to perform the following administrative actions:

- Manage the contact information on the registration entry.
  - Some registrars offer anonymous registration services.
- Manage the [nameservers](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#nameserver) that your domain uses.

- Manage DNSSEC, which is a security feature for domains.


This document will explain how to identify your domain’s registrar.

## Identify your registrar

To identify your registrar, perform the following steps:

1. In your web browser, navigate to [InterNIC’s website](http://www.internic.net/whois.html).

2. Enter your domain name in the text box.

3. Select _Domain_.

4. Click _Submit_. A new page will appear that contains information about your domain at the registrar.

5. _The Registrar URL_ line contains your registrar’s home page.


For example, the following image contains the registration information for the cpanel.net domain:

![registration information for the cpanel.net domain](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/cpanelregistrar.png)

The registrar for `cpanel.net` is Tucows, and their website is `http://www.tucows.com/`

## Additional information

- If you do not remember your account or password, use your registrar’s account and password recovery options.

- If the registrar says that you used one of their registrar resellers, check your billing records to find that company’s website.

- If the search results return an anonymous or hidden entry, it will still return the name and URL of the registrar.

- Some hosting providers also provide domain registration services in their hosting packages. Ask your hosting provider for assistance.
