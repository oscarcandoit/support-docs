Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

To edit a team user, click _Edit User_ in the [_Manage Team_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team) interface’s _List Team_ table. A new interface will appear. It displays the various settings for a team user, such as their username, password, role, and other settings.

## Edit a Team User

To edit a team user, change the desired settings:

1. Enter a new username for the existing team user in the _Username_ text box. The username will always precede the cPanel account’s primary domain (for example, `user@example.com`).
2. In the _Password_ section, select _The user will set the account password_ to send the team user an email to allow them to set their password. Or, select _Set the user’s password_ to set the team user’s password. For information on requirements for secure passwords and password generation, read our [_Password & Security_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/password-and-security/) documentation.
3. Enter the team user’s new email address in the _Contact Email_ text box.
4. Select the desired options from the [_Roles_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team/#roles) menu to assign roles to a team user. If you do not assign roles to a team user, that team user will **only** be able to edit their personal account preferences.
5. Select the _I have read and understood the security risk warning._ checkbox.
6. In the _Notes_ text box, enter any notes related to the team user. The text box can contain up to 100 characters. This text box is optional.
7. In the _Security Settings_ section, you can enter expiration information for the team user. The expiration setting [suspends](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team/#suspend-a-team-user) the account on the specified date in the future.

   - If desired, select a date from the _Expire On_ menu.
   - In the _Expire Reason_ text box, enter a reason for the expiration. The text box can contain up to 100 characters. This text box is optional.
   - Click _Set Expire Date_ to set the expiration date. You can select _Set expire date and notify user_ from the menu to send an email to the team user with the new expiration information.

Click _Save_ to save the changes to the team user and return to the _Manage Team_ interface. You can click _Go Back_ to cancel this action and return to the _Manage Team_ interface.
