## Add an Access IP

Last modified: _2022 November 28_

## Overview

The _Add an access IP_ interface adds new IP addresses to a list of IP addresses that can access a _Manage2_ account.

## _Add an access IP_ address

To permit IP addresses access to a Manage2 account, perform the following steps:

1. From the _User:_ menu, select the user account or user groups to which you wish to apply the access IP address. You can select from the following menu options:
   - Individual user accounts to which you possess administrative access to modify.
   - User groups to which you possess administrative access to modify.
   - User groups to which you possess administrative access to modify **and** your account.
2. In the _Access IP Address_ text box, enter the IP address. To specify a range of IP addresses, enter an asterisk (`*`) in the final text box. For example, enter `255.255.255.*` to allow access from all IP addresses from ranges `255.255.255.0` to `255.255.255.255`.







Important:





For security reasons, we do **not** recommend that you use an asterisk (`*`) in the third text box.

3. Click _Add_.
