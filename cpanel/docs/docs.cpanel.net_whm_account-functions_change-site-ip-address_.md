Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface allows you to change an account’s IP address. You can use this interface, for example, to assign a unique IP address to a site in order to host an SSL-secured website.

Important:

- This interface **requires**`root`-level permissions on the server. To grant these permissions to a reseller account, use WHM’s [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Resellers » Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).
- To change one of your domains’ IP addresses, you **must** first obtain the IP address from your data center and add it in WHM’s [_Add a New IP Address_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/ip-functions/add-a-new-ip-address/) interface ( _WHM » Home » IP Functions » Add a New IP Address_).
- If you run a data center, obtain your IP addresses from your Regional Internet Registry (RIR). For more information, read the [Wikipedia article on Regional Internet Registries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_Registry).

## Change the IP address

To change a site’s IP address, perform the following steps:

1. Select the account or user from the _Account Selection_ menu.






Note:




Use the Account Search By feature to search for an account by domain or by user.


2. Click _Change_.

3. Select the new IP address from the _New Address_ menu.

4. Click _Change_.
