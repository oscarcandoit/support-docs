Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature allows you to force users to change their passwords. After you use this feature, the system prompts cPanel users to change their passwords the next time that they log in to cPanel. The system will not allow them to access the full functionality of the cPanel interface until they change their passwords.

## Force change

To force specific users to change their passwords, perform the following steps:

1. Select the _Forced?_ checkboxes that correspond to the desired cPanel users.

   - Select as many cPanel users as you wish.
   - Use the buttons at the top of the interface to select or deselect all of your cPanel users.
2. Click _Submit_.

Note:

The _Forced?_ checkbox remains checked until the user has changed their password.
