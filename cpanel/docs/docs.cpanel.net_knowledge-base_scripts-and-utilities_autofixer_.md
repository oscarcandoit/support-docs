## Overview

You can use the Autofixer script collection to fix some common issues from a browser that you cannot otherwise access from the command line.

## The Autofixer scripts

To use the Autofixer scripts, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to `https://serverip:2087/scripts2/autofixer` in your preferred browser, where `serverip` represents your server’s IP address.
2. Log in as the `root` user.
3. Enter the Autofixer script name to run.
4. Click _Submit_.

The selected Autofixer script will display the results in the browser.

### Available Autofixer scripts

Warning:

Do **not** run an Autofixer script unless cPanel Technical Support instructs you to do so.

You can use the following Autofixer scripts:

- `safesshrestart` — This script restores the SSH configuration file and restarts SSH.
- `test` — This script is a test Autofixer on your system and does not apply any changes.
- `update_gatherer_permissions` — This script ensures that required [Configuration Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics) features are enabled.
