### Password Generator

The _Password Generator_ feature generates secure passwords, which are difficult for malicious users to guess. You can use the _Password Generator_ feature in any interface that displays it.

To set the security requirements of the new password, perform the following steps:

1. Click _Advanced Options_.
2. Enter the desired length of the password in the _Length_ text box.
3. Select whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
4. Copy the password in a safe place and select the _I have copied this password in a safe place_ checkbox at the bottom of the window.
5. Click _Use Password_ to use the generated password. To reject the password and close the _Password Generator_ window, click _Cancel_.
