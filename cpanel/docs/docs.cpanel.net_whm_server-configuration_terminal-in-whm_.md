Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

The _Terminal_ interface allows you to access an in-browser terminal application for direct command-line access within a cPanel & WHM session.

Warning:

Commands that you enter in this interface can render your server inoperable. We **strongly** recommend that only users with command-line experience use this feature.


Note:

- Resellers **must** possess the Everything ACL for this interface to appear in WHM. For more information, read the _Root Access_ section of our [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges/) documentation.

- Alternatively, some resellers may be able to use cPanel’s [_Terminal_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/advanced/terminal-in-cpanel/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Advanced » Terminal_).

- If you log out of the WHM interface, all associated _Terminal_ interface sessions will automatically close after a short period. Any commands still running in those terminal sessions will continue to run until that session closes.


## The Terminal interface

Before you can access the _Terminal_ interface, you must accept the warning notice. Click _I understand and want to proceed_.

Note:

This message does **not** appear in future sessions.


## Terminate a session

When you end a session in the _Terminal_ interface, it terminates access to the interface’s terminal window. To open another session, click _Reconnect_.
