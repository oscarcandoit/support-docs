## Overview

This interface allows you to view or update your company information.

Important:

For security purposes, WebPros International, LLC will only discuss account information with contacts that you enter in this interface. If you wish to allow additional people to receive company information or to make changes to your account, add their names and contact details with this interface.

## Update your company information

To update your company’s information, modify the appropriate information and click _Save_.

Note:

- You **cannot** update the _Company Name_ and _DBA_ sections. If you wish to update this information, click _Contact Us_ at the top right corner of the interface to contact Customer Service.
- You **cannot** use commas to add multiple names, email addresses, or phone numbers in a text box. Create a new contact set for each contact you wish to add.
- Use the _Company Domains_ text box to list domains that will automatically receive enterprise-level support from WebPros International, LLC. Add only the domains that are directly associated with your company. The tickets that you open from these domains will count toward your support usage.

## cPanel Store Integration

The _cPanel Store Integration_ options allow you to enable or disable the ability to obtain the following items from the cPanel Store:

- Paid SSL certificates, including DV, EV, and OV certificates.
- Free dedicated hostname certificates.
- Free certificates covering all domains on a single cPanel & WHM server.

To disable the _cPanel Store Integration_ options, select the checkbox for the service that you wish to block and click _Save_.

- _cPanel Store_ — Select this option to display the purchase banner with a link to the cPanel Store.
- _Custom Store_ — Select this option to enable the _Enter Custom URL_ text box. Enter the desired custom link to display the product purchase banner with a link to your online marketplace.

Note:

The _Enter Custom URL_ text box requires the **full** desired URL path. For example, to display a purchase banner for CloudLinux on `example.com`, enter `example.com/products/purchase-cloud-linux/`.

To disable a banner, select _Disable_ and click _Save_.
