Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

The _Webalizer_ interface displays traffic statistics from the Webalizer statistics program. For more information about Webalizer, visit the [Webalizer repository](https://github.com/hyc/webalizer).

## View your Webalizer statistics

Webalizer divides domain statistics by their SSL status. When you use the _Webalizer_ interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Webalizer_), your domain statistics will also appear with this division. If you use SSL for any part of your website that users access, an entry labeled _SSL_ will appear in addition to an unlabeled non-SSL entry.

To view Webalizer statistics for a domain, click _View_ for that domain. A new interface will appear that displays a graph and a summary of the Webalizer traffic statistics for that domain.

Note:

If you have a domain that contains both SSL and non-SSL subdomains or pages, make sure to look at both entries to fully understand your domain’s statistics.

To view even more detailed monthly statistics, click that month’s link. A new interface will appear and display charts and tables with the following information:

- Daily and hourly statistics in graphs and tables.
- The links through which visitors access your website.
- HTTP codes.
- Operating systems.
- Browser information.
- Countries of origin.
