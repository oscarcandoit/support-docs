## Manage Users

Last modified: _2019 August 20_

* * *

## Overview

This interface allows you to manage users and their privileges. When you create additional Manage2 user accounts, you can specify the account’s privileges. For example, a user account for an accounts payable department would need the ability to view and pay invoices.

## The Manage Users interface

The _Manage Users_ interface displays the following information for each account:

- _ID_ — The account’s ID number.

- _Name_ — The user’s name.

- _Username_ — The account’s username.

- _Email_ — The user’s email address.

- _Company_ — The user’s company.

- _Type_ — The account type.

- _Admin lvl_ — The assigned admin level for the user.
  - By default, this value is `0` for your primary account and `-10` for all additional accounts.
  - Higher numbers correlate with greater access privileges.
- _Last login_ — The date and time of the account’s last login.

- _Actions_ — See the [Actions](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/users/manage-users/#actions) section below.


Note:

- To sort the _Manage Users_ table by a column, click the arrow icon next to that column’s label.
  - By default, the interface sorts users by their _ID number_.
- To display information for a specific user, enter all or part of that user’s _ID_, _Name_, or _Username_ in the _Search_ text box and click _Search_.

- To clear the search and view all accounts, click the `X` icon in the _Search_ text box.


## Actions

You can perform the actions described below when you click on the appropriate link in the Actions column for a user.

- _Delete_ — Remove a user from your account. A confirmation interface will appear. Click _Delete_ to confirm.

- _Edit_ — An interface that allows you to modify a user’s information and account privileges.






Note:




For more information, read our [_Edit Users_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/users/edit-users/) documentation.


- _Reset Security_ — Reset a user’s security questions. A confirmation interface will appear. Click _Go_ to confirm.






Note:




When you reset a user’s security questions, Manage2 **requires** the user to enter four new security questions and answers at their next login.
