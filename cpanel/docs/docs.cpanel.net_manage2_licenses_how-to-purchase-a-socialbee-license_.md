## Overview

[SocialBee](https://socialbee.com/), an AI-powered social media manager, handles everything from scheduling posts to content generation, allowing your users to target social media campaigns effectively and efficiently.

## Purchase a SocialBee license from Manage2

Important:

- To buy a SocialBee license through Manage2, you **must** be a cPanel Partner.
- After purchasing, you **must** use the activation link and code to activate your SocialBee license.

To purchase a SocialBee license, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) interface.
2. In the _Licenses_ section, click _Add License_.
3. Select the group and package to which you wish to add the SocialBee license.
4. Select the number of users, profiles, and [workspaces](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#workspace) to add to the license. You can **only** add profiles in increments of 5.
5. Click _Add Licenses_.

A success message that contains the activation link and code will appear at the top of the Manage2 interface. You will also receive this information in an email. Follow the link and use the code to activate your SocialBee license.

Important:

We **strongly** recommend that you keep this email to retain a record of your SocialBee license’s default number of users, workspaces, and profiles.

For more information, read our [Add License](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/add-license) documentation.
