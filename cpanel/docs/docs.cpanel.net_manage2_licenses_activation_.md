Last modified: _2024 December 19_

* * *

## Overview

Use the _Activation_ interfaces to sign the required agreement for each license type.

Important:

- You must agree to the license type’s terms to activate that license type in Manage2.
- These steps do **not** activate individual 360 Monitoring, koality, or Sitejet Studio licenses. To activate these, use the activation links that you receive when you add the licenses.

## Sign the Product Terms of Use agreement

To sign a license type’s agreement, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the license type’s _Activation_ interface. For example, for CloudLinux™, go to the _CloudLinux Activation_ interface ( _Dashboard » Licenses » CloudLinux Activation_).
2. Read all of the displayed terms.
3. Optionally, click _Download Agreement_ to download a copy of the terms.
4. Enter your full name.
5. Click _I Agree_.

## Postpone agreement

If you do not want to agree to the terms now, click _Do this later_.

Important:

You **must** sign the agreement to activate this license type in Manage2.


## Reject agreement

If you choose not to sign the agreement, you can reject it. For example, click _Reject CloudLinux_ to reject the CloudLinux agreement.
