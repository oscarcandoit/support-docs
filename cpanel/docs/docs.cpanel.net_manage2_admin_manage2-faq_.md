* * *

## Overview

This document lists frequently asked questions about our Manage2 site.

## Accounts

### How do I log in to my Manage2 account?

To log in to Manage2, enter your username and password in the [_Manage2 login_](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) interface.

Note:

- If this is your first time to log in, use the login ID and password that WebPros International, LLC provided to you.
- The system automatically logs you in to the Manage2 interface if you are already logged in to another WebPros International, LLC website.

### How can I reset my login information?

If you cannot log in or forgot your login information, click the _Forgot Your Password?_ link in the [_Manage2 login_](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) interface.

### How do I create another Manage2 account?

You can create another Manage2 account with the Manage2 [_Add User_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/users/add-user/) interface ( _Dashboard » Users » Add User_).

Important:

You **must** possess Partner Account Administrator privileges to create additional accounts. For more information about account privileges, read our [Manage Users](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/users/manage-users/) documentation.


### Why does Manage2 ask me security questions after I log in?

If you reach an interface that asks you to answer security questions for access, one of the following conditions exists:

- You attempted to log in from an IP address that is not authorized on the account.
- You have not yet set up the security questions for your account.

If you do not know the security question answers, or you have not set up your security questions, use the Manage2 [_Security Setup_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/security/security-setup/) interface ( _Dashboard » Security » Security Setup_).

Note:

For more assistance with your security questions, click the Manage2 _Help_ link to contact cPanel Customer Service.

To add an Access IP address to your account, use the Manage2 [_Add an access IP_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/security/add-an-access-ip/) interface ( _Dashboard » Security » Add an access IP_).

### How do I access the Manage2 API with my account?

After you add an Access IP address, you can call a Manage2 API function through your web browser, cPanel’s Licensing Perl or PHP modules, and in the command line with the curl utility.

Note:

For more information about how to call a Manage2 API function, read our [Guide to the Manage2 API](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/knowledge-base/guide-to-the-manage2-api) documentation.
