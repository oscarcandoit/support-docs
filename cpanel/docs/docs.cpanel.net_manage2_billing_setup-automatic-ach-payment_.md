## Overview

Use the _Setup Automatic ACH Payment_ interface to generate a form to enroll in Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments from your checking or savings account.

Important:

You **must** use a United States (US) bank account to set up ACH payments.


## Set up ACH payments

Note:

You **must** provide a cancelled check from your bank account to set up automatic payments.

To set up automatic ACH payments, perform the following steps:

1. Enter the nine-digit routing number in the _Routing Number \[1\]_ text box.
2. Enter your bank account number in the _Account Number \[2\]_ text box.
3. Select which _Account Type_ matches your bank account. If you do not know the account type, contact your bank.
4. Enter the full name of your bank or financial institution in the _Depository Name (Financial Institution) \[4\]_ text box.
5. Enter your bank or financial institution’s branch name in the _Branch Name_ text box.
6. Enter the _City_, _State_, and _Zip_ that appear on the top of the check in the appropriate text boxes.
7. Click _Fetch Form_.
8. Manage2 will display a PDF form. Print and sign the provided PDF document, then upload the form with a copy of a cancelled check through the [_Upload Forms_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/billing/upload-forms) interface.

After you complete ACH enrollment, your monthly invoice will automatically withdraw from your account on or around the 28th of each calendar month.

## Stop automatic ACH payments

To withdraw from the automatic ACH payment program, click _Help_ in the toolbar at the top of the Manage2 interface for Customer Service contact information.
