Last modified: _2024 May 22_

## Overview

The _List Active Licenses_ interface displays information about your currently-active licenses.

## The List Active Licenses table

The _Active Licenses_ list provides the following information about, and options for, each active license.

- Click _View in Browser_ to see the _Active Licenses Table_ table.
- Use the _Show_ menu to display more licenses per page. The default number of licenses displayed is 10.
- Use the _Search_ text box to quickly locate a specific license.
- Use the filter (![arrows pointing up and down](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/filtericon.png)) icon to sort option information in ascending or descending order. You can only apply **one** filter at a time.

Important:

The table **only** lists values if they apply to that license. For example, the table only displays an IP address under the _IP_ column if that license has an associated IP address.

The table lists the following information:

- _IP_ — The license’s associated IP address.
- _Hostname_ — The license’s server’s hostname.
- _Package_ — The license’s package.
- _Accounts_ — The number of currently-active accounts.
- _Max Accounts_ — The maximum number of accounts that you may include with the license.
- _Group_ — The license’s assigned group.
- _Version_ — The license’s currently-installed version of cPanel.
- _OS_ — The operating system (OS) of the license’s associated server.
- _Arch_ — The CPU architecture of the license’s server.
- _Add Date_ — The assignment date of the IP address to the license.
- _External Note_ — The notes for the license.
- _Sites_ — The number of site monitors for a 360 Monitoring license or the number of sites for a WP Guardian license.
- _Self-Hosted Sites_ — The number of self-hosted sites for a Sitejet Studio license.
- _Hosted Sites_ — The number of hosted sites for a Sitejet Studio license.
- _Servers_ — The number of server monitors for a 360 Monitoring license.
- _Additional Projects_ — The number of projects for a koality license.
- _Actions_ — The actions that you can perform on the license:

  - _Expire_ — Remove a license from your account in the _Expire License_ interface.
  - _View/Modify_ — View or modify a license in the [_Modify a License_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/modify-a-license/) interface.
  - _Transfer_ — Transfer a license to another IP address in the [_Transfer a license_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/transfer-a-license/) interface.

## The Packages table

The _Packages_ table displays the total number of dedicated licenses per package.

Note:

The _Adjusted Count_ value is the total number of dedicated licenses, **half** of the total number of virtual licenses, and each block of 500 paid Enkompass™ accounts.
