Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface enables you to email every cPanel user simultaneously. This feature is useful, for example if your server will be down temporarily for maintenance or if you need to contact users about security issues.

## Email users

To email your users, perform the following steps:

1. Enter your information for the _Sender Name_, _Sender Email_, _Subject_, and _Message Body_ text boxes.
2. Select the _Send Email to Resellers’ Customers as well._ checkbox if you want to also email the resellers’ customers.






Note:




To send a message to resellers **only**, use the [_Email All Resellers_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/email-all-resellers/) interface _(WHM » Home » Account Functions » Email All Resellers)_.


3. Click _Send_. The first time you click _Send_, the page refreshes. Use this time to review the information that you entered.
4. To send the email, click _Send_ again. The following items appear when the email sends:

   - A list of recipients, including the username and email address of each recipient.
   - The _Emails have been sent!_ message.






     Warning:




     You **must** click _Send_ again to send the email.

To review email activity, use the appropriate [cPanel & WHM log file](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/the-cpanel-log-files/#mail).
