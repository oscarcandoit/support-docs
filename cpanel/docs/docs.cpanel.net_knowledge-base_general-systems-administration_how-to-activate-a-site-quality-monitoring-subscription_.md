## How to Activate a Site Quality Monitoring Subscription

Last modified: _2024 November 19_

* * *

## Overview

To use the [Site Quality Monitoring](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) feature, you must first complete the sign-up process and activate your subscription.

Important:

- Your hosting provider can disable Site Quality Monitoring and its paid subscriptions. If you cannot see the [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_) or purchase paid subscriptions when you should be able to, contact your hosting provider.
- This document covers subscription activation. For more information about subscription management, read our [How to Manage a Site Quality Monitoring Subscription](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-manage-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/) documentation.

## The sign-up process

While you must activate **each** Site Quality Monitoring subscription that you purchase, you only have to complete the sign-up process to activate your **first** subscription.

The sign-up process contains three components:

- The [_Ready to start?_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-activate-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/#ready-to-start) menu
- The [_Security Code_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-activate-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/#security-code) section
- The [_Compare plans_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-activate-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/#compare-plans) menu





Note:




This menu will **only** appear if your hosting provider has enabled paid subscriptions.



### Ready to start?

When you access the [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_) without an active subscription, the _Ready to start?_ menu will appear.

To complete the sign-up form, perform the following steps:

1. Select the domain you wish to begin monitoring from the _Monitored domain_ menu.
2. Enter an email address to receive monitoring alert emails in the _Email Address_ text box.
3. Check _I agree to receive notifications from Site Quality Monitoring at the above email address._ You **cannot** complete the sign-up process without consenting to receive monitoring alert notifications. You may edit the frequency of these notifications later in the [_Settings_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-settings/) section of the [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_).
4. Click _\+ Create Project_. The _Ready to start?_ menu will close, and the [_Security Code_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-activate-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/#security-code) section will appear.

### Security Code

When you have completed the sign-up form, the _Security Code_ section will appear.

To find your security code, retrieve it from the inbox of the email you entered in the _Email Address_ text box.

Important:

If you do **not** see monitoring emails in your inbox, check your _Spam_ folder. If the email is not in your _Spam_ folder, check that you signed up using the correct email address. If there is an issue with your email address, click _Cancel_ to return to the _Ready to start?_ menu and enter the correct email address.

Enter your security code in the text box and click _\+ Activate_ to activate your first Site Quality Monitoring subscription.

### Compare plans

If your hosting provider has enabled paid subscriptions, the _Compare plans_ menu will appear.

We will automatically assign your website [a `Free` subscription](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-manage-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/#free-subscription-provisions). To use this subscription, click _Continue_.

To increase your monitoring capabilities, click _Upgrade_ underneath the subscription whose monitoring capabilities you want to assign to your website. A payment interface will open in a new window. Complete your purchase to assign the subscription.

For more information about managing a Site Quality Monitoring subscription, read our [How to Manage a Site Quality Monitoring Subscription](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-manage-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/) documentation.
