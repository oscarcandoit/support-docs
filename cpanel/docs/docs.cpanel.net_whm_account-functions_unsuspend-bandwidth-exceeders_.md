Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature allows you to simultaneously unsuspend all of the accounts that have exceeded their bandwidth. Accounts will remain unsuspended until the next bandwidth check.

When an account exceeds its bandwidth limit, its website becomes inaccessible to users; however, the account’s owner may still log in to their cPanel account.

## Unsuspend accounts

To unsuspend all accounts that have exceeded their bandwidth, click _Proceed_.

Remember:

Suspension and bandwidth limiting are two separate functions. Sometimes one is mistaken for the other. For more information, read our [Account Suspension Versus Bandwidth Limiting and Account Termination](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/account-suspension-versus-bandwidth-limiting-and-account-termination/) documentation.
