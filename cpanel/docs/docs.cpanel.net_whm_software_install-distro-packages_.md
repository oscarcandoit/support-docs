Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

RPM® (RPM Package Manager) refers to a software format, the software that the package contains, and the package-management system.

- Your cPanel & WHM server includes several pre-installed packages and the ability to install more. However, this interface allows you to install a package for the operating-system distribution, rather than the cPanel-provided packages.
- To troubleshoot any RPM installation failures that may occur, follow the steps in our [RPM Installation Failures](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/package-management/rpm-installation-failures) documentation.
- For more information about RPMs, visit [the RPM website](https://rpm.org/).






Notes:





- The interface requires several seconds to load due to the packages that reside on your server.
- This interface **only** allows you to install packages that currently reside in your system’s repositories. You **cannot** install packages from a third-party repository.

## Install a distribution package

To install a package, perform the following steps:

1. In the _Provide a partial package name_ text box, enter the package’s name that you wish to install.
2. Click _Search_.
3. In the search results table, click _Install_ for the package you wish to install.

The interface will display the installation process.
