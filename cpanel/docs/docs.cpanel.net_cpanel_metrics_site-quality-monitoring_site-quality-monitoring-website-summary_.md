Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

The _Website Summary_ tab displays information about your monitored website’s overall health, including any current and recently-fixed errors.

## Rating

The _Rating_ tab summarizes your monitoring check scores in **all** monitoring check categories. Each category displays a title, summary, score, and health bar. The health bar reflects a monitoring check category’s overall score and is also a color indicator.

You may select the _details_ link underneath each monitoring check category to proceed to that category’s _Summary_ section.

## Current findings

The _Current findings_ tab summarizes errors that Site Quality Monitoring has detected and the user has not yet fixed. Monitored URLs that produce errors are listed by their monitoring check category. The error lists include the following information for each error:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Page_ | The monitored URL that generated the error and the type of error it produced. This entry also includes a vertical color score indicating the error’s type. |
| _Section_ | The specific check in the monitoring category that registered the error. |
| _Found_ | The time that the error has been active in days. This entry contains the date and time when Site Quality Monitoring registered the error. |
| _Description_ | A brief description of the error. |

You may click an error’s _Section_ entry to open the corresponding monitoring check tab.

If your website does not contain any errors, you will see a success message instead.

## Past findings

The _Past findings_ tab summarizes errors that the user fixed within the past 48 hours. Monitored URLs that produced errors are listed by their monitoring check category. The error lists include the following information for each error:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Page_ | The monitored URL that generated the error and the type of error it produced. This entry also includes a vertical color score indicating the error’s type. |
| _Section_ | The specific check in the monitoring category that registered the error. |
| _Timestamp_ | The timestamp registers when you fixed the error. You may use this information to determine which of your actions solved the error. |
| _Description_ | A brief description of the error. |

If you have not fixed any errors in the past 48 hours, you will see a message confirming that instead.
