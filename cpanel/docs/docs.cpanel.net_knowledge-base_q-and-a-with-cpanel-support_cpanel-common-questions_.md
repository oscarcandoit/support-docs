## cPanel Common Questions

Last modified: _2025 February 13_

* * *

## Overview

This document is a reference guide to the most common questions asked by our users.

Important:

You may have to contact your hosting provider to implement some of these solutions.

## Website

### Why is my website down?

There are many reasons why your website might be down. The following are the most common reasons:

- **Plugin issue** – Contact your hosting provider.







Note:





If you are using WordPress®, verify that your WordPress plugins are up-to-date. For more information, refer to WordPress’ [_Plugins_](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) documentation.

- **DNS-related issue** – There are many reasons why you might experience a DNS-related issue. The [_Zone Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/zone-editor/) feature ( _cPanel » Domains » Zone Editor_) can help you with many of them. This feature allows you to create, edit, and delete Domain Name System (DNS) zone records. DNS converts human-readable domain names (for example, `example.com`) to computer-readable IP addresses (for example, `192.0.0.1`). DNS relies on zone records that exist on your server to map domain names to IP addresses.

- **An HTTP Error** – The most common error codes you will encounter:
  - **500 Internal Server Error** – The server encountered an unexpected condition. This error appears when the server cannot gather any specific information about the problem. This often occurs when the server cannot fulfill an application request because of a misconfigured application. To resolve this issue, contact your hosting provider.
  - **403 Forbidden Error** – The server will not allow the visitor to access the requested file. If a visitor receives this code in error, check the file’s permission settings. You can use cPanel’s [_File Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/file-manager/#update-file-or-folder-permissions) interface ( _cPanel » Files » File Manager_) to check and update file permissions.
  - [**404 Not Found**](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/q-and-a-with-cpanel-support/cpanel-common-questions/#why-am-i-getting-a-404-error) – The server did **not** find a visitor’s requested file. This error commonly occurs when a visitor mistypes a URL.
  - **504 Gateway Timeout Error** – The server didn’t receive a timely response from the upstream server. This is temporary and typically resolves on its own.






    More:





    For more information, read our [_HTTP Error Codes and Quick Fixes_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/web-services/http-error-codes-and-quick-fixes/) documentation.
- **An issue with the `.htaccess` file.** \- For more information on `.htaccess` files, read our [Advanced Apache Configuration](https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/apache/advanced-apache-configuration/#htaccess-files) documentation.

- **Database error** – Confirm that your database has the right login credentials. If the issue continues, the database server may be down. Contact your hosting provider.

- **Domain registrar issue** – For more information, read our [How to Identify Your Registrar](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/dns/how-to-identify-your-registrar) documentation.






Note:





Ensure that you are using the proper nameserver. Contact your hosting provider.

- **Maintenance window** – Your hosting provider or network provider may have scheduled a maintenance window. Maintenance windows allow providers to perform upgrades, hardware repairs, and other necessary work at a specific time. This lets their customers know that an outage isn’t due to an unexpected failure or issue. Check your email for announcements or contact your hosting provider.

- **Network issue** – To test your network, run the [traceroute and ping commands](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-server-administration/how-to-run-the-traceroute-and-ping-commands/).

- **Server issue** – Contact your hosting provider.


### How do I update PHP?

To update your PHP, use one of the methods listed in our [How to Update Your System](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-update-your-system/#php) documentation.

### How do I install WordPress?

To install WordPress, follow the steps in our [How to Install WordPress With cPanel](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/third-party/how-to-install-wordpress-with-cpanel/#install-wordpress) documentation.

### Why am I getting a 404 error?

The server did **not** find a visitor’s requested file. This error commonly occurs for one of the following reasons:

- **File or directory requested does not exist** – Ensure the file name is correct and you have uploaded the file to the server.
- **An issue with the `.htaccess` file** – For more information on `.htaccess` files, read our [Advanced Apache Configuration](https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/apache/advanced-apache-configuration/#htaccess-files) documentation.
- **DNS-related issue** – There are many reasons why you might experience a DNS-related issue. The [_Zone Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/zone-editor/) feature ( _cPanel » Domains » Zone Editor_) can help you with many of them. This feature allows you to create, edit, and delete Domain Name System (DNS) zone records. DNS converts human-readable domain names (for example, `example.com`) to computer-readable IP addresses (for example, `192.0.0.1`). DNS relies on zone records that exist on your server to map domain names to IP addresses.
- **A permalink issue in WordPress** – For information about permalinks, read WordPress’ [_Using Permalinks_](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-permalinks/) article.
- **Invalid File permissions** – Contact your hosting provider.
- **A mistyped URL** – Verify the URL is correct.

### How do I backup and restore my site?

- New users may prefer to use the [_Backup Wizard_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/backup-wizard/) interface ( _cPanel » Files » Backup Wizard_). The _Backup Wizard_ interface allows you to back up all or part of your website, or to restore it from the most recent backup file.
- Experienced users may prefer to use the [_Backup_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/backup-for-cpanel) interface ( _cPanel » Files » Backup_). The _Backup_ interface allows you to download and store your site in a backup file. This interface also allows you to restore your website from a backup file.

## Email

### How do I access my webmail account?

Navigate to cPanel’s [_Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-accounts/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_). Then, locate the email account in the table and click _Check Email_. The _Webmail_ interface will open in a new browser tab.

### I can’t send and receive emails.

There could be several reasons why you are unable to send and receive emails.

- **Port 25 closed** – This port **must** be open to send and receive emails. Contact your hosting provider.
- **Mail Client configured incorrectly** – Read our [_Set Up a Mail Client_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client) documentation to check your mail client configuration.
- **SPF/DKIM configured incorrectly** – To update your SPF/DKIM settings, read our [Email Deliverability in cPanel](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-deliverability-in-cpanel) documentation.
- **IP Address reputation** – For more information, read our [_Blacklisting & IP Address Reputation_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/email/blacklisting-ip-address-reputation/) documentation.
- **Invalid HELO** – The `/etc/mailhelo` file contains Exim’s configuration for the `HELO` command, which initiates dialog between a mail server and a client. This file governs which domain sends the `HELO` command. For more information, read our [`mailhelo`](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/email/how-to-configure-the-exim-outgoing-ip-address/#the-mailhelo-file) file documentation.
- **Exim queue full** – To clear your queue or delete specific messages, read our [_How to Manage Your Exim Queue_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/email/how-to-manage-your-exim-queue) documentation or contact your hosting provider.
- **DNS-related issue** – Use the [Email Deliverability in cPanel](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-deliverability-in-cpanel) interface to identify problems with your mail-related DNS records for one or more of your domains.

### Why can’t I configure my mail client?

- **Invalid SSL certificate** – Your SSL certificate has expired.

  - If you purchased your SSL certificate, you can use the [_SSL/TLS_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/ssl-tls) interface (cPanel » Security » SSL/TLS) to install and manage SSL certificates and private keys, which enhance your website’s security. You can use this interface to generate signing requests, which may be needed by the certificate provider before they can issue a certificate.
  - If your hosting provider issued your SSL certificate, contact your hosting provider.
  - If your provider has enabled the [SSL/TLS Status](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/ssl-tls-status) interface ( _cPanel » Security » SSL/TLS Status_) on your cPanel account, you can view, upgrade, or renew your domains’ SSL certificates.
- **Invalid ports** – Some ports **must** be open for cPanel to accept incoming or outgoing data. For more information, read our [How to Configure Your Firewall for cPanel & WHM Services](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-configure-your-firewall-for-cpanel-services) documentation.
- **Invalid setting** – To update your settings, read our [_Set Up Mail Client_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client/) documentation.
- **Invalid servername** – To verify your servername, read our [_Set Up Mail Client_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client/) documentation.
- **Invalid username** – To verify your username, read our [_Set Up Mail Client_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client/) documentation.
- **DNS issue** – Use the [Email Deliverability in cPanel](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-deliverability-in-cpanel) interface (to identify problems with your mail-related DNS records for one or more of your domains.
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol not supported** – The mail client does **not** support [Transport Layer Security protocol version 1.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246) (TLSv1.2) or later. cPanel & WHM only supports TLSv1.2 or later. The system enables TLSv1.2 by default.

### I am receiving spam emails.

If you are receiving spam email, use our [_Spam Filter_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/spam-filters) interface. This interface allows you to configure the spam filter settings (powered by Apache SpamAssassin™) for your account. Spam filters identify and sort or delete unsolicited email, commonly known as spam.

You can also use the `Junk` button in Roundcube to train the system to recognize spam.

## Server

### How do I increase disk quota?

Contact your hosting provider if you wish to request a higher disk usage quota.

### How do I renew SSL?

The [_SSL/TLS Wizard_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/ssl-tls-wizard) interface allows you to easily purchase, renew, and install SSL certificates for domains on your account. In order for the _SSL/TLS Wizard_ to appear in your cPanel account, contact your hosting provider.

### How do I renew AutoSSL?

The [_SSL/TLS Status_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/ssl-tls-status) lets you view, upgrade, or renew your domains’ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.

### What is the AutoSSL email notification?

If your hosting provider has enabled notifications for AutoSSL, the system will send you an email when it generates or renews an AutoSSL certificate for a domain. For more information, read our [_SSL/TLS Status_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/ssl-tls-status) documentation.

## Domains

### How do I transfer my domain?

- **Transfer your domain from one registrar to another** – Visit or request support from the new domain name registrar.
- **Transfer your hosted content from one server to another** – Use the [_Transfer Tool_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/transfers/transfer-tool). To transfer accounts, you must obtain `root`-level privileges with the `su` or `sudo` commands, or contact your hosting provider.
- **Point your DNS to a new server** – Contact your hosting provider.

### How can I add an addon domain?

To add an addon domain, read our [_Domains_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/domains) documentation.

## DNS

### Where do I make changes to my DNS settings?

The [_Zone Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/zone-editor/) feature ( _cPanel » Domains » Zone Editor_) allows you to create, edit, and delete Domain Name System (DNS) zone records. DNS converts human-readable domain names (for example, `example.com`) to computer-readable IP addresses (for example, `192.0.0.1`). DNS relies on zone records that exist on your server to map domain names to IP addresses.

### How do I update MX records?

The [_Zone Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/zone-editor/) feature ( _cPanel » Domains » Zone Editor_) allows you to update MX records. You can set the following values using the _Zone Editor_ interface:

- **Priority** — Identifies the servers that handle a domain’s email. This value for each MX record determines the order in which other mail servers will use the domain’s mail server. A lower value indicates a higher priority level. A value of `0` indicates the highest priority level.
- **Destination** — The mail server. This must be a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).

## Database

### Why is my database not connecting?

- **Incorrect or out of sync password for the database user** – For MySQL® or MariaDB® database users, read our [_Manage My Databases_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/databases/manage-my-databases/) documentation.
- **DNS-related issue** – There are many reasons why you might experience a DNS-related issue. The [_Zone Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/zone-editor/) feature ( _cPanel » Domains » Zone Editor_) can help you with many of them. This feature allows you to create, edit, and delete Domain Name System (DNS) zone records. DNS converts human-readable domain names (for example, `example.com`) to computer-readable IP addresses (for example, `192.0.0.1`). DNS relies on zone records that exist on your server to map domain names to IP addresses.
- **Server issue** (`max_connections`, InnoDB issue, DOS) – Contact your hosting provider.
- **User/user@host does not have the required grants to the database** – Contact your hosting provider.
- **Database crashed and needs to be repaired** – Contact your hosting provider.
- **Optimization required** – Contact your hosting provider.
- **Website coding issues** – Contact your hosting provider.
