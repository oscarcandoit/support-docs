## Overview

The _Onboarding Assistant_ appears for new cPanel account users and provides a starting point for using the [cPanel interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface).

Note:

- The interface’s options will change depending on your hosting provider and account settings.
- A user with `root`-level privileges can hide the _Onboarding Assistant_.

- [_WordPress_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/onboarding-assistant/108/#wordpress) \- This option creates a website using WP Toolkit.
- [_Restore from backup_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/onboarding-assistant/108/#restore-from-backup) \- This option restores a website from a backup file.
- [_Explore Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/onboarding-assistant/108/#explore-account) \- This option closes the _Onboarding Assistant_ and reveals the [cPanel interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/).

### WordPress

The WordPress® option creates a website for you. An informational panel will appear while the system creates your website. This may take a few minutes. Once the system has created your website, a success message will appear.

![message showing successful creation of WordPress website](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/onboarding-assistant-success.png)

Click the _Add content_ button to begin customizing your website. This option redirects you to cPanel’s [_WP Toolkit_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-developed-plugins/wp-toolkit/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » WP Toolkit_).

If you are not ready to customize your website, you can choose one of the following options:

- _Preview your site example.com_ \- This option opens a new window with a preview of your website.
- _Update your password and set your security preferences_ \- This option redirects you to cPanel’s [_Password & Security_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/password-and-security/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Preferences » Password & Security_) to update your cPanel account password and set security setting for your account.
- _Set up an email account with calendars and contacts_ \- This option redirects you to cPanel’s [_Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-accounts/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_).

### Restore from backup

The _Restore from backup_ option redirects you to cPanel’s [_Backup Wizard_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/backup-wizard/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Files » Backup Wizard_). This interface allows you to back up all or part of your website or restore it from the most recent backup file.
