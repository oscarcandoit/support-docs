Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface allows you to download an FTP server’s raw access logs. The raw access logs are plain text files that list every connection that visitors made to a particular domain’s FTP server, as well as the files that visitors uploaded and downloaded.

Note:

This interface is **only** available when you enable FTP services on your server. For more information, read our [_Service Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/service-manager/) documentation.

## Download the log

To download the raw access log, perform the following steps:

1. Select the domain for which you wish to download the log and click _Download_.






Note:




The system compresses the log for download.


2. Click the link to download the log.

3. Use a plain text reader to open and view the log.
