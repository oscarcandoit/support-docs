Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

Warning:

Commands that you enter in this interface can render your cPanel account inoperable. We **strongly** recommend that only users with command-line experience use this feature.

The _Terminal_ interface allows you to access an in-browser terminal application for direct command-line access within a cPanel & WHM session.

Notes:

- This interface only appears if both of the following conditions are true:
  - You possess shell access.
  - Your hosting provider enables the _SSH Access & Terminal_ feature in WHM’s [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM » Home » Packages » Feature Manager_).
- For information on how to identify and contact your hosting provider, read our [How to Identify Your Hosting Provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider) documentation.

- This feature only appears if your hosting provider’s [server profile](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary) enables it.

- If you log out of the cPanel interface, all associated _Terminal_ interface sessions will automatically close after a short period. Any commands still running in those terminal sessions will continue to run until that session closes.


## The Terminal interface

Before you can access the _Terminal_ interface, you **must** read and accept the warning notice. Click _I understand and want to proceed_.

Note:

This message does **not** appear in future sessions.

## Terminate a session

When you end a session in the _Terminal_ interface, it terminates access to the interface’s terminal window. To open another session, click _Reconnect_.
