Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

Use this interface to change your account settings.

## Consent and Privacy

Note:

This section **only** appears if your hosting provider enables it.

This feature lets you opt in or out of [Interface Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics-the-data-we-use/#interface-analytics).

You can use the _Account Type_ menu to specify whether your account is for an individual or a business. To change your account type, select an option from the _Account Type_ menu and click _Save Changes_.

We automatically install the Interface Analytics plugin by default but do **not** enable it. The server owner **and** individual users **must** enable the Interface Analytics plugin before it begins to collect data.
Data collection depends on the selections made at the server and account levels as follows:

| Server level | Account level | Interface Analytics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | Yes | Enabled |
| Yes | No | Disabled |
| No | Yes | Disabled |
| No | No | Disabled |

To enable Interface Analytics, select the _Allow Tracking_ checkbox. To disable Interface Analytics, clear the checkbox. Then, click _Save Changes_.

## System Notifications

This function sets where on the screen that system notifications appear. To change the location of your system notifications, select a location from the menu and click _Save Changes_.

Note:

- This setting applies to every page on which a notification appears.
- The location of system notifications defaults to the top right of the screen.
- The _middle-middle_ selection will create an overlay for the screen. Press `Esc` or click the _X_ icon to close the notification.
