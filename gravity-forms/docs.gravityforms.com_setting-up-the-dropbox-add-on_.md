# Setting Up the Dropbox Add-On

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-dropbox-add-on/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Standard Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-dropbox-add-on/#h-standard-setup)
- [Authentication](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-dropbox-add-on/#h-authentication)
- [Creating a Feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-dropbox-add-on/#h-creating-a-feed)
- [Custom Dropbox App Setup (Optional)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-dropbox-add-on/#h-custom-dropbox-app-setup-optional)
- [Set Up](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-dropbox-add-on/#h-set-up)

## Pre-Requisites

- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install and activate](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the Dropbox Add-On
- A [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) account
- A [File Upload](https://docs.gravityforms.com/file-upload) field on your form

From your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to **Form** → **Settings** → **Dropbox** to access these settings.

## Standard Setup

### Authentication

1. Go to Gravity Forms settings page and select **Dropbox** in the side menu.
2. If you don’t have a Dropbox account click **sign up** on the Dropbox Settings page. Otherwise, click the **Connect to Dropbox** button.
3. You will be sent to the Dropbox site to grant authorization. If you have profiles for work and personal, you’ll need to select the one you want to use. Click **Allow**. After granting access, you’ll be sent back to your site.

Once you have authenticated with Dropbox, you’re ready to begin [creating a feed for the Dropbox Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-dropbox/).

### Creating a Feed

Gravity Forms utilizes feeds to determine what to do with form submission data. To have uploaded files sent to Dropbox, you’ll need to create a feed. Refer to the article [Creating a Feed for the Dropbox Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-dropbox/) for instructions.

Once you save your settings, your configuration of the Dropbox Add-On will be complete, and your file upload fields on the form will send to Dropbox. If you have any other forms that you want to use with Dropbox, be sure to configure them as well, since feeds are form-specific.

## Custom Dropbox App Setup (Optional)

**Note**: Using a custom Dropbox app with the Dropbox Add-On requires SSL. If you do not have an SSL certificate installed on your site, you will need to contact your hosting provider to obtain one.

Dropbox.com restricts third-party apps to only accessing their own folder. Using a Custom Dropbox App is _only necessary_ if you need to upload files to a location outside of the default app folder created for the Dropbox Add-On.

### Set Up

This section assumes that you have already [created a custom Dropbox app](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-custom-dropbox-app/).

1. Go to the **Dropbox Settings** page and click _I want ot use a custom Dropbox app_.You will see **OAuth Redirect URI**, **App Key**, and **App Secret**. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URI** to be used later.
2. Open the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) and select the Dropbox app you would like to connect.

4. Paste the **OAuth Redirect URI** you copied in step 1 into the **Redirect URIs** field and click **Add.**
5. Copy the **App key** and **App Secret** and paste them in the **Gravity Forms – Custom Dropbox Settings** page.
6. Hit enter and a new button labeled **Click here to connect to Dropbox** will show. Click it.
7. Sign in if asked, and authorize the Dropbox Add-On. You have now successfully authorized the Dropbox Add-On to access your Dropbox account.
