## Articles

[**Confirmations Object** \\
The Confirmations object is an associative array containing the properties for all the confirmations which exist for a form. When a new form is created a single confirmation, named Default Confirmation, is created. There is no limit to the number of additional confirmations you can create but they must have conditional logic configured.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmations-object/ "Confirmations Object")
