# Entry Trash

Unwanted entries are not deleted immediately. Instead, these entries are moved to the **Trash**. An entry can only be permanently deleted after it has been moved to the Trash.

The website admin is responsible for “emptying” the Entry Trash—it **is not** deleted by any automated means .

See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entries/) for information on trash and other actions you can perform on entries.

**Important Note:** When an entry is permanently deleted, all files associated with this entry will also be immediately deleted. There is no way to recover a permanently deleted entry.
