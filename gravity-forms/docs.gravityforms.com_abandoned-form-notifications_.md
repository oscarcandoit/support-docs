## What Are Abandoned Form Notifications?

Abandoned Form Notifications allow you to engage with users who start filling out a form but leave before submitting it. This feature is especially useful for capturing leads, recovering potential sales, or simply reminding users to complete a form.

## Pre-Requisites

- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the [Partial Entries](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-partial-entries-add/) Add-On.
- Download and install [Gravity Flow](https://gravityflow.io/).

## How To Create Abandoned Form Notification?

The Partial Entries Add-On integrates with Gravity Flow to trigger workflows when a partial entry is created, enabling you to send emails to users who abandoned a form.

1. Go to Form Settings > Partial Entries.
2. Enable the **Workflow** setting in the Partial Entries Add-On Form settings.

[![Screenshot showing how to enable the workflow setting in the Partial Entries Add-On.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-21-1024x401.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-21.png)

3. When the workflow setting is enabled for the Partial Entries Add-On, a new type called the Partial Entry Submission step is available. This step waits for the form’s final submission.

[![Screenshot displaying the available step types, including the new Partial Entry Submission step.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23-1024x618.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23.png)

You should now be ready to create a workflow to send abandoned form notifications. [This Gravity Flow article](https://docs.gravityflow.io/article/258-partial-entries) provides more details on building a workflow integrated with the Partial Entries Add-On.
