## Introduction

You can apply Conditional Logic to manage entries flagged as “toxic” or “non-toxic” by the [Moderation Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-moderation-add-on/). This feature allows you to customize notifications and confirmations based on the entry toxicity level. In this article, we’ll guide you on using Conditional Logic with the Moderation Add-On to handle entries marked as Toxic.

## Confirmations Settings

Go to the Confirmation settings page to add a confirmation or edit an existing one (other than the default confirmation), and navigate to the bottom of the page to find the Conditional Logic settings.

This [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmation-type-page/) provides more information about creating and editing confirmations.

**Note:** it is not possible to add conditional logic to the default confirmation.

![Image showing Confirmation settings for a form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-5-1024x401.png)

Refer to [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmation-type-page/) for more information about configuring Confirmations.

### Show A Confirmation When An Entry Is Marked As Toxic

Here, you can determine the criteria for showing a confirmation based on the entry’s toxicity score, ranging from 0 to 1. You can find more information about scoring in [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/moderation-add-on-settings-reference/#h-add-on-settings).

In this example, if the Toxicity Score exceeds 0.6, we will show this Notification.

### Show A Confirmation When An Entry Is Marked As Non Toxic

A Non Toxic entry is an entry with a Toxicity Score of 0. In this example, we will show a confirmation when the score is 0.

## Notifications Settings

Go to the Notifications settings page to add a notification or edit an existing one, and navigate to the bottom of the page to find the Conditional Logic settings.

This [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-notifications-in-gravity-forms/) provides more information about creating and editing notifications.

### Trigger A Notification When An Entry Is Marked As Toxic

Here, you can determine the criteria for sending the notification based on the entry’s toxicity score, which can range from 0 to 1. You can find more information about scoring in [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/moderation-add-on-settings-reference/#h-add-on-settings).

In this example, if the Toxicity Score exceeds 0.6, we will trigger a Notification.

[![Image showing Conditional Logic settings for a form Notification](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2-1024x277.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2.png)

In this example, if the Toxicity Score is greater than 0 but less than 0.3, we will trigger a different Notification.

### Trigger A Notification When An Entry Is Marked As Non Toxic

A Non Toxic entry is an entry with a Toxicity Score of 0. In this example, we will trigger a Notification when the score is 0.

- [Enabling Conditional Logic for Confirmations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enable-conditional-logic-for-confirmations/). Here we will show you how to use conditional logic within your form confirmation messages.
- [Enabling Conditional Logic for Notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enable-conditional-logic-for-notifications/). Conditional logic can be used with Notifications to determine which notification is sent to the user based on the data they input into the form.
- [Configuring Confirmations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmation-type-page/). In this article, we will show you how to change your confirmation message, as well as create custom confirmation messages based on the content that is submitted.
