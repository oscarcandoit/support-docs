# Holding Notifications until after Payment

- [Payment Completed Event Notification](https://docs.gravityforms.com/holding-notifications-until-after-payment/#h-payment-completed-event-notification)
- [Supported Add-Ons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/holding-notifications-until-after-payment/#h-supported-add-ons)
- [Other Gravity Forms Notification Events](https://docs.gravityforms.com/holding-notifications-until-after-payment/#h-other-gravity-forms-notification-events)

This article explains how to send notifications after the payment has been completed when using payment add-ons.

## Payment Completed Event Notification

The **Payment Completed** notification event will send the notification when a payment has successfully been completed. This is not to be confused with the _Subscription Created_ event which will occur when a new subscription is created.

In order to enable this notification event, perform the steps below. This article assumes you have already created a form and the associated feed to the payment service.

1. From the left hand navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and then click on **Forms**.
2. Select your form from the Forms list.
3. Hover over **Settings** and click on **Notifications**.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-06-at-11.48.44.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-06-at-11.48.44.png)

4. From the Notifications list page, click **Edit** to edit the existing admin notification, or click **Add New** to create a new notification.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-5.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-5.png)

5. On the Notification page, select **Payment Completed** from the **Event** drop down. This will send the notification when a payment has successfully been completed.

[![Hold Notification until Payment - Payment Completed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-06-at-11.59.11.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-06-at-11.59.11.png)

6. Click the **Update Notification** button to save your changes.

## Supported Add-Ons

The **Payment Completed** notification event is available in the following add-ons:

- PayPal Checkout Add-On
- PayPal Standard Add-On
- PayPal Payments Pro Add-On
- Stripe Add-On
- Authorize.Net Add-On
- Mollie Add-On
