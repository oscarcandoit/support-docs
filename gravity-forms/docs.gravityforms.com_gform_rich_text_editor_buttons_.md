## Description

The “gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons” filter in Gravity Forms controls the buttons displayed in the first row within the Gravity Forms rich text editor. This hook may be filtered by FORMID or by FORMID + FIELDID.

## Usage

Applies to all forms:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_rich_text_editor_buttons'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );` |

To target a specific form append the form id to the hook name. (format: gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons\_FORMID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_rich_text_editor_buttons_2'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );` |

To target a specific form field append the form id and field id to the hook name. (format: gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons\_FORMID\_FIELDID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_rich_text_editor_buttons_2_6'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

- **$mce\_buttons** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)
Array of buttons to include within the TinyMCE editor inside Gravity Forms.


|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `array``(``'formatselect'``,``'bold'``,``'italic'``,``'bullist'``,``'numlist'``,``'blockquote'``,``'alignleft'``,``'aligncenter'``,``'alignright'``,``'link'``,``'unlink'``,``'spellchecker'``);` |

**Note:** Spell Checker button was removed from WP core since version 3.6; you need to install a third-party plugin if you want to use it, e.g. [TinyMCE Spellcheck](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-spellcheck/).

- **$editor\_id** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The HTML element ID for the field using the rich text editor.

- **$field\_object** [object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/object)

Object containing information about the field.


## Examples

This example shows how you can add another button.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_rich_text_editor_buttons'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``my_function(``$mce_buttons``) {`<br>```$mce_buttons``[] =``'wp_more'``;`<br>```return``$mce_buttons``;`<br>`}` |

This example shows how you can remove the majority of the buttons.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_rich_text_editor_buttons'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``my_function(``$mce_buttons``) {`<br>```$mce_buttons``=``array``(``'bold'``,``'italic'``,``'bullist'``);`<br>```return``$mce_buttons``;`<br>`}` |

The following will apply for all fields with the rich text editor enabled in a form with id 2.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_rich_text_editor_buttons_2'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``my_function() {`<br>```$mce_buttons``=``array``(``'bold'``,``'italic'``,``'bullist'``);``// Enable only Bold, Italic and Bullet List buttons`<br>```return``$mce_buttons``;`<br>`}` |

## Filtering additional button rows

Gravity Forms also makes filters available to control the display of buttons in rows two through four of the rich text editor:

- [gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons\_row\_two](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_rich_text_editor_buttons_row_two/)
- [gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons\_row\_three](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_rich_text_editor_buttons_row_three/)
- [gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons\_row\_four](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_rich_text_editor_buttons_row_four/)

These filters can be used in the exact same way as the [usage examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_rich_text_editor_buttons/#usage) for the gform\_rich\_text\_editor\_buttons filter above but they allow you to filter additional rows in the rich text editor. Which row is filtered is noted in the filter name.

By default WordPress includes buttons in the first and second row of the TinyMCE editor, but other components in your site’s setup could include buttons in the third and fourth row including via these filters.
