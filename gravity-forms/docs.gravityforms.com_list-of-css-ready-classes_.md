# List of CSS Ready Classes

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/list-of-css-ready-classes/#h-introduction)
- [Reference List](https://docs.gravityforms.com/list-of-css-ready-classes/#h-reference-list)
- [Caveat](https://docs.gravityforms.com/list-of-css-ready-classes/#h-caveat)

**Note**: With the release of Gravity Forms 3.1, [support for legacy markup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/about-legacy-markup/) will be fully removed. This change marks the end of the original markup structure introduced in 2009 and finalizes the platform’s transition to modern form rendering. Although modern markup has been available since version 2.5, many forms still rely on legacy markup features, including Ready Classes, for layout control. Refer to the [CSS Ready Classes Migration](https://docs.gravityforms.com/migrating-your-forms-from-ready-classes/) guide for more information.

## Introduction

This article contains a reference list of the available CSS ready classes in Gravity Forms core. Each of the classes here are expanded upon in our [detailed CSS Ready Classes article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/css-ready-classes/).

## Caveat

As with any CSS rules, your particular theme CSS may override or supersede some of these styles. You may have to make some adjustments to your theme styles for everything to work properly.
