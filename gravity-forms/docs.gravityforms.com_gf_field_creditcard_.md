## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_CreditCard class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Credit Card field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission.

**Note:** GF\_Field\_CreditCard is deprecated, we recommend creating a [new field type](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/) instead.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the credit card style`<br>`$card_style``=``$field``-&gt;creditCardStyle;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **admin\_label\_setting**



Controls whether the “Admin Field Label” setting appears.

- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**



Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.

- **credit\_card\_setting**



Controls whether the “Supported Credit Cards” section displays. This allows specific available credit cards to be selected for use.

- **credit\_card\_style\_setting**



Controls whether the “Card Icon Style” section displays. This allows the style of the credit card icons to be set to **Standard** or **3D**.

- **css\_class\_setting**

- **input\_placeholders\_setting**



For complex fields like the credit card, name, time, and address fields, this controls whether the “Placeholders” section will appear which lets you set placeholder text for the individual components of the field. When it is not a complex field, the “placeholder\_setting” controls the display of this section.

- **label\_setting**



Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.

- **rules\_setting**



Controls whether the “Rules” settings section displays. The “Required” option shows when this is active.
