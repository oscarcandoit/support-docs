# Obtaining and Saving your FreshBooks (Classic) API Credentials

**Deprecation notice:** As of mid-2022, the FreshBooks (Classic) product and API have been discontinued by FreshBooks. This add-on is no longer available for download.

If you would like Gravity Forms to consider supporting other FreshBooks products, you can register your interest on our [Product Feature Roadmap](https://www.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-roadmap/) page.

To begin using the FreshBooks Add-On, you will first need to obtain and save your FreshBooks API settings. In this article, we will show you how to get started with obtaining your FreshBooks API credentials, as well as saving them inside the settings page.

1. Log into your FreshBooks account.
2. [![freshbooks-api-1](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-1.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-1.png) Click on **My Account** at the top right of the page.
3. [![freshbooks-api-2](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-2-300x26.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-2.png) Click on **FreshBooks API**.
4. [![freshbooks-api-3](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-3-300x52.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-3.png) You should now see your **API URL** as well as your **Authentication Token**. Make note of these as you will be inputting them into the FreshBooks Add-On shortly.
5. [![freshbooks-api-4](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-4-300x218.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/freshbooks-api-4.png) Log into your WordPress admin dashboard and hover over **Forms**, then click on **Settings**.

7. You will see two fields, **Site Name** and **Authorization Token**. Within the **Site Name** field, enter only the beginning of your API URL. For example, if your full API URL reads _https://exampleuser.freshbooks.com/api/2.1/xml-in_, simply enter _exampleuser_ into this field. In the **Authorization Token** field, enter the authorization token that you obtained from FreshBooks.
8. Click the **Update Settings** button to save your changes.

You have now successfully configured the FreshBooks Add-On for Gravity Forms to communicate with the FreshBooks API. You’re now ready to [setup a feed within the FreshBooks Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-freshbooks-add-on/).
