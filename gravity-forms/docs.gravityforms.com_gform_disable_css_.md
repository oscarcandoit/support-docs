## Description

The filter `gform_disable_css` can be used to disable all CSS files from being loaded on the frontend. This covers styles responsible for handling conditional logic, column structures, hidden fields, CSS Ready Classes, and other form elements.

**Note:** Using this filter to disable CSS output can prevent add-ons, such as [Conversational Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-conversational-forms-add-on/), from functioning properly.

**Note:** Using this filter can create accessibility issues. For more information on ensuring your form remains accessible, refer to our [Accessibility Guide for Content Providers](https://docs.gravityforms.com/accessibility-for-content-providers/) and [Accessibility Checklist for Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/accessibility-checklist-for-gravity-forms/) articles.

## Incompatibilities

Some fields and form settings won’t work as expected when the filter is enabled:

- The [honeypot](https://docs.gravityforms.com/spam-honeypot-enhancements/) anti-spam field, normally hidden from users, will be shown on the front end.
- The Datepicker field can lose its default styling.
- [CSS Ready Classes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/list-of-css-ready-classes/) may not work as intended, breaking the intended form structure or layout.
- [Hidden](https://docs.gravityforms.com/hidden/) fields and fields with Visibility set to hidden may appear on the front end.
- Multi-paged forms might not work as expected.
- Conditional Logic might not work as expected.
- Fields with the [enhanced UI](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-accessibility-warning/#h-advice-regarding-specific-fields) enabled won’t work as expected.

## Usage

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_disable_css'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

## Parameters

- **$is\_css\_disabled** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool/)

Indicates if CSS files are to be loaded by Gravity Forms. Default is false.

## Example

### Disable loading of CSS files

This example would disable all loading of CSS files for all forms.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_disable_css'``,``'__return_true'``);` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.
