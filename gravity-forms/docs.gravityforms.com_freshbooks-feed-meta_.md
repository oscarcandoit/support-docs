# Freshbooks Feed Meta

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/freshbooks-feed-meta/#h-introduction)
- [Usage](https://docs.gravityforms.com/freshbooks-feed-meta/#h-usage)

## Introduction

The [Feed Meta object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/feed-object) for the Freshbooks Add-On is an associative array containing the properties which determine how the add-on should process the form submission.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9 | `$feed``[``'meta'``] =``array``(`<br>```'feedName'``=>``'Your Feed Name'``,`<br>```'email'``=>``'2'``,`<br>```'updateClient'``=> true,`<br>```'feed_condition_conditional_logic'``=> true,`<br>```'feed_condition_conditional_logic_object'``=>``array``(`<br>```'conditionalLogic'``=>``array``(),`<br>```),`<br>`);` |

## Usage

We recommend accessing the $feed meta using the rgar() or rgars() functions, e.g.:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13 | `$conditional_logic_enabled``= rgars(``$feed``,``'meta/feedCondition'``);`<br>`if``(``$conditional_logic_enabled``) {`<br>```// Conditional logic is enabled for this feed.`<br>```$logic_rules``= rgars(``$feed``,``'meta/feed_condition_conditional_logic_object/conditionalLogic/rules'``);`<br>```foreach``(``$logic_rules``as``$rule``) {`<br>```// Process each conditional logic rule.`<br>```$field_id``= rgar(``$rule``,``'fieldId'``);`<br>```$operator``= rgar(``$rule``,``'operator'``);`<br>```$value``= rgar(``$rule``,``'value'``);`<br>```// Example: Use $field_id, $operator, and $value in your logic.`<br>```}`<br>`}` |
