# Resetting Your Password

You can request a reset of your Gravity account password using the following procedure.

1. Navigate to the [Login](https://gravity.com/login) page and click on the **Forgot Password** link beneath the login button.
2. In the **Email Address** field, enter your account email address and click the **Send Reset Link** button.
3. A password reset email will be sent. Find it ( _make sure you check your Bulk or Spam folders_) and click the reset password link within.
4. You will be returned to the [gravity.com](http://gravity.com/) website, where you will be prompted to enter your new password. Enter one with appropriate strength and click the **Reset Password** button to complete the process.
5. Record your new password somewhere secure!

If your new password is deemed to be algorithmically weak, a warning will be presented. If you still wish to stick with this weak password, you must check the **Confirm use of weak password** checkbox, though we obviously do not recommend it!
