## Introduction

PayPal Subscriptions enable you to set up recurring payments on a flexible schedule. Subscription support was added in version 2.0 of the official Gravity Forms PayPal Checkout Add-On.

**Note**: If you receive a notice indicating that credit cards are not supported for subscriptions and will not be displayed on the form itself, you will need to adjust the field settings. This field is [not supported in all markets and accounts by PayPal](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-paypal-checkout-add-on/#h-credit-card-field-support). You can uncheck the Credit Card option under [Supported Payment Methods](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-field/#supported-payment-methods) in the PayPal Field settings to disable this notice.

## Configuration

For your PayPal compatible form, choose **Form → Settings → PayPal Checkout**. Create new, or edit an existing feed.

## Settings Reference

### General Settings

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Transaction Type** | Set to **Subscription** to load the Subscription Settings options. |
| **Recurring Amount** | Choose either a specific Product field or the Form Total to use all pricing fields as the recurring amount. |
| **Subscription Product Type** | Specify the product type: **Digital**, **Physical**, or **Service**. |
| **Billing Cycle** | Defines how often the recurring payment occurs. Choose a numeric interval of **days**, **weeks**, **months**, or **years**. |
| **Recurring Retry** | Defines the frequency of the recurring payment. Choose a numeric interval of **days**, **weeks**, **months**, or **years**. |
| **Recurring Times** | Enable retrying the charge after a failed payment attempt. |

1. Change the **Transaction Type** to **Subscription.** This will load the **Subscription Settings** options.

**Image showing Trial settings.**

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Setup Fee** | You can enable a **Setup Fee** instead of a trial. Click **Enabled**, then choose a Product field from your form to use as the setup fee. |
| **Trial** | Use the **Trial** option to establish a trial period for the subscription. Click **Enabled** to activate and configure additional settings: select a **Trial Price** (free, fixed amount, or Product field) and set the **Trial Period** in days, weeks, months, or years. |

Only one option, Setup Fee or Trial, can be active at a time.

## Entry Details

The entry detail screen will show **the Subscription Details** box, including status, start date, subscription ID, and recurring amount.

## Notifications

You can [set up notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-notifications-in-gravity-forms/) for the [subscription related events](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-notification-events/). Each of these events can initiate a notification that you can [configure normally](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-notifications-in-gravity-forms/).
