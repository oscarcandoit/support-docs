## Introduction

In this article we will show how you can use the [Add-On Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework) to include a new field type which extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class.

## Getting Started

Create a file with your add-on slug as the filename, this file will contain your plugin headers, define the version number, and handle including the actual add-on after Gravity Forms has loaded.

Here is the content of our simplefieldaddon.php file, excluding the plugin headers.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18 | `define(``'GF_SIMPLE_FIELD_ADDON_VERSION'``,``'1.0'``);`<br>`add_action(``'gform_loaded'``,``array``(``'GF_Simple_Field_AddOn_Bootstrap'``,``'load'``), 5 );`<br>`class``GF_Simple_Field_AddOn_Bootstrap {`<br>```public``static``function``load() {`<br>```if``( ! method_exists(``'GFForms'``,``'include_addon_framework'``) ) {`<br>```return``;`<br>```}`<br>```require_once``(``'class-gfsimplefieldaddon.php'``);`<br>```GFAddOn::register(``'GFSimpleFieldAddOn'``);`<br>```}`<br>`}` |

## Define the Add-On class

1. Create a second php file, in this case we have named it class-gfsimplefieldaddon.php.

2. In this file you would include the Add-On Framework files by calling the following:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `GFForms::include_addon_framework();` |

3. Inherit the Add-On Framework by creating a new class which extends GFAddOn:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `class``GFSimpleFieldAddOn``extends``GFAddOn {}` |

4. Add [the class variables](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfaddon/#the-class-variables) to configure the add-on.





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `protected``$_version``= GF_SIMPLE_FIELD_ADDON_VERSION;`<br>`protected``$_min_gravityforms_version``=``'1.9'``;`<br>`protected``$_slug``=``'simplefieldaddon'``;`<br>`protected``$_path``=``'simplefieldaddon/simplefieldaddon.php'``;`<br>`protected``$_full_path``=``__FILE__``;`<br>`protected``$_title``=``'Gravity Forms Simple Field Add-On'``;`<br>`protected``$_short_title``=``'Simple Field Add-On'``;` |

5. Add support for getting an instance of the add-on.

When Gravity Forms is loading it initializes the add-ons, it does this by looping through each registered add-on and calling its get\_instance function. Adding a get\_instance function also helps other developers integrate with your add-on.





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9 | `private``static``$_instance``= null;`<br>`public``static``function``get_instance() {`<br>```if``( self::``$_instance``== null ) {`<br>```self::``$_instance``=``new``self();`<br>```}`<br>```return``self::``$_instance``;`<br>`}` |

6. Include the new field.

To ensure that the new field is available when entry exports are performed we will include the file containing our fields class by overriding the pre\_init() function.





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `public``function``pre_init() {`<br>```parent::pre_init();`<br>```if``(``$this``->is_gravityforms_supported() &&``class_exists``(``'GF_Field'``) ) {`<br>```require_once``(``'includes/class-simple-gf-field.php'``);`<br>```}`<br>`}` |

7. Add any custom settings and tooltips required by the field.

New settings can be defined by using the [gform\_field\_standard\_settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_field_standard_settings), [gform\_field\_appearance\_settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_field_appearance_settings), and [gform\_field\_advanced\_settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_field_advanced_settings) hooks.

Tooltips for those new settings can also be defined using the [gform\_tooltips](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_tooltips) filter.

As these hooks are only required in the admin we can include them by overriding the init\_admin() function like so:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6 | `public``function``init_admin() {`<br>```parent::init_admin();`<br>```add_filter(``'gform_tooltips'``,``array``(``$this``,``'tooltips'``) );`<br>```add_action(``'gform_field_appearance_settings'``,``array``(``$this``,``'field_appearance_settings'``), 10, 2 );`<br>`}` |





Define the tooltips function:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `public``function``tooltips(``$tooltips``) {`<br>```$simple_tooltips``=``array``(`<br>```'input_class_setting'``=> sprintf(``'<h6>%s</h6>%s'``, esc_html__(``'Input CSS Classes'``,``'simplefieldaddon'``), esc_html__(``'The CSS Class names to be added to the field input.'``,``'simplefieldaddon'``) ),`<br>```);`<br>```return``array_merge``(``$tooltips``,``$simple_tooltips``);`<br>`}` |





Define the field\_appearance\_settings function:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15 | `public``function``field_appearance_settings(``$position``,``$form_id``) {`<br>```// Add our custom setting just before the 'Custom CSS Class' setting.`<br>```if``(``$position``== 250 ) {`<br>```?>`<br>```<li``class``=``"input_class_setting field_setting"``>`<br>```<label``for``=``"input_class_setting"``>`<br>```<?php esc_html_e(``'Input CSS Classes'``,``'simplefieldaddon'``); ?>`<br>```<?php gform_tooltip(``'input_class_setting'``) ?>`<br>```</label>`<br>```<input id=``"input_class_setting"``type=``"text"``class``=``"fieldwidth-1"``onkeyup=``"SetInputClassSetting(jQuery(this).val());"``onchange=``"SetInputClassSetting(jQuery(this).val());"``/>`<br>```</li>`<br>```<?php`<br>```}`<br>`}` |

8. Include any Scripts or Styles.

See the [Including Scripts and Styles when using the Add-On Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/include-scripts-styles-with-addon-framework/) article.


## Define the Field class

1. Create a third php file, in this case we have named it class-simple-gf-field.php and located it within our plugins includes directory.

2. Within this file create a new class which extends GF\_Field:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `class``Simple_GF_Field``extends``GF_Field {}` |

3. Within the new class define the field type property:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `public``$type``=``'simple'``;` |

4. Override get\_form\_editor\_field\_title() to define the field title displayed in the form editor:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `public``function``get_form_editor_field_title() {`<br>```return``esc_attr__(``'Simple'``,``'simplefieldaddon'``);`<br>`}` |

5. Override get\_form\_editor\_button() to add the field button to the form editor:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6 | `public``function``get_form_editor_button() {`<br>```return``array``(`<br>```'group'``=>``'advanced_fields'``,`<br>```'text'``=>``$this``->get_form_editor_field_title(),`<br>```);`<br>`}` |

6. Review the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) article to see the other methods you can override to define your new fields appearance and functionality.

7. At the end of the file, after your fields class, register the new field with Gravity Forms:





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `GF_Fields::register(``new``Simple_GF_Field() );` |
