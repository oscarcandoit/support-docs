## Introduction

[![notification-events](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/notification-events-300x163.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/notification-events.png)

Since Gravity Forms 1.9.12, add-ons which extend [GFFeedAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gffeedaddon) or [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) can register custom events for which they will send notifications.

Once the events your add-on supports are registered, the user can then edit their notifications (or create new notifications) and assign them to your new events.

**The events drop down only appears on the edit notification page when multiple notification events exist for the form; it will appear between the notification name and send to settings.**

## Registering the Add-On Events

To register the events for which your add-on will trigger the sending of notifications, override supported\_notification\_events() with an array containing the event keys and labels.

In this example we are registering a number of events which the Stripe Add-On supports, but only if the form has a Stripe feed.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15 | `public``function``supported_notification_events(``$form``) {`<br>```if``( !``$this``->has_feed(``$form``[``'id'``] ) ) {`<br>```return``false;`<br>```}`<br>```return``array``(`<br>```'complete_payment'``=> esc_html__(``'Payment Completed'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```'refund_payment'``=> esc_html__(``'Payment Refunded'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```'fail_payment'``=> esc_html__(``'Payment Failed'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```'create_subscription'``=> esc_html__(``'Subscription Created'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```'cancel_subscription'``=> esc_html__(``'Subscription Canceled'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```'add_subscription_payment'``=> esc_html__(``'Subscription Payment Added'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```'fail_subscription_payment'``=> esc_html__(``'Subscription Payment Failed'``,``'gravityformsstripe'``),`<br>```);`<br>`}` |

## Triggering the Sending of the Notifications

### GFPaymentAddOn

If your add-on extends [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) and the events are listed under [Events supported by GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/notifications-custom-events-addon-framework/#events-supported-by-gfpaymentaddon), there’s nothing else to do; the payment framework will handle triggering the notifications when those payment events occur.

If your add-on overrides [callback()](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon/#callback) and specifices a callback parameter in the $action array returned then you would need to trigger the sending of notifications in the function you registered as the callback. You can do that by including the following line in your custom callback:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$this``->post_payment_action(``$entry``,``$action``);` |

### GFFeedAddOn

For add-ons which extend [GFFeedAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gffeedaddon) you would need to trigger the notifications using the [GFAPI::send\_notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/api-functions/#send-notifications) method at the appropriate time.

In this example we are triggering notifications for a custom event called **feed\_processed** at the end of the process\_feed function.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `public``function``process_feed(``$feed``,``$entry``,``$form``) {`<br>```// feed processing code here`<br>```GFAPI::send_notifications(``$form``,``$entry``,``'feed_processed'``);`<br>```return``;`<br>`}` |

## Events Supported by GFPaymentAddOn

GFPaymentAddOn() will automatically trigger the sending of notifications for the following events:

- complete\_payment
- refund\_payment
- fail\_payment
- add\_pending\_payment
- void\_authorization
- create\_subscription
- cancel\_subscription
- expire\_subscription
- add\_subscription\_payment
- fail\_subscription\_payment

- LinkedIn
