# Basics

The Design and Layout > Basics section covers background knowledge you may need to modify form presentation. There are simple changes you can make using external plug-ins and field tweaks, but the most powerful control options will require some knowledge of CSS.

## Options For Making Style Changes

1. **Field Appearance**: You can make field level layout changes using the [Appearance tab](https://docs.gravityforms.com/appearance-field-settings/) for a field within the form editor. It is the _Custom CSS Class_ option that holds hidden power, especially when combined with our [CSS Ready Classes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/css-ready-classes/).
2. **Third Party Plug-Ins**: There are a selection of third party plug-ins that give you fine-grained control over the appearance of your Gravity Forms, and can help alleviate any anxiety you may have about dealing with CSS. Search our [community plugin repository](https://www.gravityforms.com/community/?gv_search=style) for options.
3. **Modifying CSS**: The greatest amount of customization exists for those who are comfortable working with CSS. Refer to \[this article\] (https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-to-put-your-custom-css/) describing methods you can use to modify theme styles.

## CSS Reference Materials

The following documents contain lots of information on Gravity Forms CSS.

- [CSS visual guide and overview](https://docs.gravityforms.com/design-overview/) contains a visual indictaor of the classes and where they exist in the form hierarchy. An HTML and a downloadable PDF version are available.
- [CSS element naming structure](https://docs.gravityforms.com/basic-structure/) describes
- [CSS targeting examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/css-targeting-examples/) contains a large list of form element IDs, allowing you to target items such as validation messages and the submit button style.

## CSS Examples

These articles contain a few simple examples of using CSS to modify form appearance, hopefully just enough to get you started:

- [change font sizes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/changing-font-sizes/)
- [change form background color](https://docs.gravityforms.com/changing-forms-background-color/).

Then extend your knowledge with our comprehensive list of [CSS targeting examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/css-targeting-examples/).
