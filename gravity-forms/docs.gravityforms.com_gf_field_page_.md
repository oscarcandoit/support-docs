# GF\_Field\_Page

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_page/#h-introduction)
- [Settings and Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_page/#h-settings-and-properties)
- [Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_page/#h-settings)
- [Source Code](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_page/#h-source-code)

## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_Page class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Page field is rendered in the form editor. This only handles the section called “PAGE BREAK”, not the “START PAGING” or “END PAGING” sections.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, view the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#h-get-form-editor-field-settings) documentation.

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the type`<br>`$type``=``$field``-&amp;gt;type;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **conditional\_logic\_nextbutton\_setting**


Determines whether the “Enable Next Button Conditional Logic” section displays in the “PAGE BREAK” settings. This allows logic to be applied to control whether the “Next” button is displayed or hidden.

- **conditional\_logic\_page\_setting**


Determines whether the “Enable Page Conditional Logic” section displays in the “PAGE BREAK” settings. This allows logic to be applied to control whether the page is displayed or hidden.

- **css\_class\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom CSS Class” setting displays. This allows a custom css to be used for the field.

- **next\_button\_setting**


Determines whether the “Next Button” section displays in the “PAGE BREAK” settings. This section allows different text or a custom image to be used for the button.

- **previous\_button\_setting**


Determines whether the “Previous Button” section displays in the “PAGE BREAK” settings. This section allows different text or a custom image to be used for the button.

Below is a listing of the properties inherited from the parent class and ones specific to the field:

- **displayOnly** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)
