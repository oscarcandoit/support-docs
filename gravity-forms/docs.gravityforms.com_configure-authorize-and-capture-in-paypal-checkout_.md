# Configuring Authorize and Capture in PayPal Checkout

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configure-authorize-and-capture-in-paypal-checkout/#h-introduction)
- [Configuration](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configure-authorize-and-capture-in-paypal-checkout/#authorization-capture-configuration)
- [Payment Details for Authorizations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configure-authorize-and-capture-in-paypal-checkout/#authorization-capture-entry-details)

## Introduction

This feature of the official Gravity Forms PayPal Checkout Add-On allows PayPal to authorize the payment on a customer’s card at entry, but to not capture that payment (that is, collect the charge) until you choose, such as upon successful shipping of an order. Refer to [Gravity Forms Entry Payment Statuses](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-entry-payment-statuses/) article for more information about payment statuses.

See [this document from PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payments/authorize-and-capture-payments/) for more information.

## Configuration

For your PayPal compatible form, choose **Form → Settings → PayPal Checkout**. Create new, or edit an existing feed.

1. Ensure **Transaction Type** is set to **Products & Services**.

2. Select the payment amount. This can be either a specific product field from your form, or the **Form Total**.

3. Enable the **Authorize only** option under **Products & Services Settings** and save your changes.

## Payment Details for Authorizations

The [entry detail screen](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-detail/) for a payment entry will show a **Payment Details** section. When using authorization & capture, the entry will initially show a **Status: Authorized** along with transaction ID, amount, and a button that will allow you to **Capture Payment**.

[![Image showing Paymen Details in the entry view](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-19.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-19.png)

Upon capturing the payment, the notes section is updated to indicate a successful capture and the **Payment Details** section updates to **Status: Paid** along with date, transaction ID, amount and a button allowing you to **Refund Payment**.

## Related Notifications

[Notifications can be configured](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-notifications-in-gravity-forms/) to fire on the event of **Authorization Voided**. Refer to [this PayPal document](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/integration-features/auth-capture/#void-authorization) for more information on voiding an authorization.
