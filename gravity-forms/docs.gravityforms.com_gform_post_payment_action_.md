## Description

This action hook can be used to perform custom actions after processing of the following payment events has occurred:

- complete\_payment
- refund\_payment
- fail\_payment
- add\_pending\_payment
- void\_authorization
- create\_subscription
- cancel\_subscription
- expire\_subscription
- add\_subscription\_payment
- fail\_subscription\_payment
- fail\_create\_subscription

## Usage

This action hook, which would run for all payment add-on feeds, can be used like so:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_action(``'gform_post_payment_action'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **$entry** | [Entry object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object) | The entry for which the payment event occurred. |
| **$action** | [Array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array) | An associative array containing the event details. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10 | `$action``=``array``(`<br>```'type'``=>``''``,`<br>```'amount'``=>``''``,`<br>```'transaction_type'``=>``''``,`<br>```'transaction_id'``=>``''``,`<br>```'subscription_id'``=>``''``,`<br>```'entry_id'``=>``''``,`<br>```'payment_status'``=>``''``,`<br>```'note'``=>``''``,`<br>`);` |

## Examples

### 1\. Send event notification

The following example shows how you can trigger the sending of form notifications registered for the event. See the [Send Notifications On Payment Events](https://docs.gravityforms.com/send-notifications-on-payment-events) article for a more detailed tutorial.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4 | `add_action(``'gform_post_payment_action'``,``function``(``$entry``,``$action``) {`<br>```$form``= GFAPI::get_form(``$entry``[``'form_id'``] );`<br>```GFAPI::send_notifications(``$form``,``$entry``, rgar(``$action``,``'type'``) );`<br>`}, 10, 2 );` |

### 2\. Access webhook event

In some cases you may need access to the webhook event that initiated the subscription cancelation. This example demonstrates how to access that event object. Note: this object is only available if the request was initiated by a Stripe webhook.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10 | `add_action(``'gform_post_payment_action'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``my_function(``$entry``,``$action``) {`<br>```// If data from the Stripe webhook event is needed (and this hook was initiated via a Stripe webhook request), you can access event data with the following line:`<br>```$event``= gf_stripe()->get_webhook_event();`<br>```if``(``$event``) {`<br>```// Access webhook event data. For event object documentation, see: https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/object`<br>```}`<br>`}` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.
