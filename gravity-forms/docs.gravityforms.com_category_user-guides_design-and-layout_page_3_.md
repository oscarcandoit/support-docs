# Design and Layout

Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, Gravity Forms makes it easy to style your forms as you see fit.

There's a reason that designers love Gravity Forms - targeting specific elements, forms, fields, etc. is quick and easy with CSS selectors and ready classes for everything you could dream of.

When not employing a built-in form theme, Gravity Forms is un-opinionated and intentionally utilizes your theme's styles to make your forms blend seamlessly into your existing designs with minimal modifications.
