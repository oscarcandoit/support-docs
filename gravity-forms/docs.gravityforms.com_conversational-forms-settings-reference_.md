## Introduction

The following article lists the settings associated with the operation and presentation of the Conversational Forms Add-On. Note that these are shown under the standard Form Settings area for whichever form you enable conversational mode. There are no add-on area global settings.

### Enable Conversational Mode

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enable Conversational Page** | Enables conversational forms for the specific form. Once switched on, this will provide access to additional settings, as detailed in the rest of this article. |
| **Conversational Page Title** | Set the title for the page on which the conversational form will be rendered. Defaults to the form title. |
| **Conversational Page URL** | A unique permalink that users can visit to view and fill out your form. It defaults to a slugged version of the form title and is not editable until settings are first saved. If the URL is already in use on the site, then `-form` will be appended. |

### Form Design Settings

These settings can be used to tailor the look and feel of your conversational mode form.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Layout** | Set overall layout for dedicated form page. |
| **Background Color** | Set a background color. |
| **Form Accent Color** | Used for various form elements, such as buttons and progress bars. |
| **Input Accent Color** | Used for aspects of individual form inputs, such as checkmarks and dropdown choices. |
| **Text Color** | Set the text color for the form. |
| **Enable Logo** | Display a logo. |
| **Logo** | Set a logo image. |
| **Logo Link** | Set a link for the Logo to be directed to when it is clicked. |
| **Enable Background Image** | Display a background image. |
| **Background Image** | Set a background image. |
| **Background Image Brightness** | Set a link for the Logo to be directed to when clicked. |

### Welcome Screen Settings

To properly orient users to a conversational mode form, it can be good practice to use a “Welcome Screen”. This can avoid any disorientation that may happen when landing a user directly into the first question on your form. Use the welcome screen to introduce your form and provide any instructions or information needed to know before users proceed.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enable Welcome Screen** | Secondary text is used as a message on the welcome screen. |
| **Heading** | Display a welcome screen before the user begins the conversation. |
| **Description** | Text on the button used for beginning the conversation. |
| **Start Button Text** | Text used as image alt attribute for the welcome image. |
| **Image** | Display an image on the welcome screen. |
| **Image Alternate Text** | Text used as image alt attribute for welcome image. |

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Continue Button Text** | Text to be displayed on button used for progressing to next field. |

### Footer Settings

Customize the look and feel of your form navigation which appears below the form fields on all conversational mode pages.
