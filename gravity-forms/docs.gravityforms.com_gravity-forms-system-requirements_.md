## Gravity Forms Core Requirements Summary

The following table shows the **minimum version numbers** required for multiple categories.

| Component | Recommended | For Support | **Minimum** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **WordPress** | 6.8 | 6.7 | **6.5** |
| **PHP** | 8.1 | 7.4 | **7.4** |
| **MySQL** (MariaDB) | 8.0 (10.5) | — | — |

These requirements may be updated at any time. Refer to the official [Gravity Forms changelog](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravityforms-change-log/) for version-specific lists of changes and updates.

Extensive environment information can be found within your Gravity Forms **System Status** page, found under the **Forms** menu item in the admin area. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/checking-environment-details/) for more information.

## Key Requirements

**Recommended System Requirements:**

For optimal Gravity Forms performance, we recommend you use the **latest production [version of WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/)**.

To facilitate that, your environment should match or exceed the [system requirements that WordPress recommends](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). Like any software, some caution should be exhibited when contemplating upgrading to a very recent major release, especially if you have not been sandbox-testing the prior betas.

**Required to obtain Support**

To [receive official Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/help/) [support](https://www.gravityforms.com/help/), we expect your Gravity Forms solution to be running the current or previous version of WordPress. For example, if WordPress 6.8 is the current major version, we will support environments running WP 6.8.x and WP 6.7.x.

When you reach out for support, you may be required to upgrade Gravity Forms or the underlying components before you can gain assistance. Refer to this [blog post from our CEO](https://www.gravityforms.com/wordpress-version-requirements-for-support/) for more context on this.

**Minimum System Requirements**

Gravity Forms Corewill not operate properly if the minimum requirements are not met or exceeded.

## Additional Requirements for Gravity Forms Add-Ons

Official Gravity Forms Add-Ons depend upon Gravity Forms Core and the frameworks contained therein. As such, they have an additional system requirement of a minimum required Gravity Forms Core version. If your Gravity Forms Core version is not sufficient for an add-on to run, it will be identified during the installation or upgrade process.

## Further information on PHP

### Required Extensions

The following PHP extensions are required to be able to use the full functionality of Gravity Forms and its official add-ons:

- ctype
- curl
- dom
- openssl

If your PHP version is not listed on [the php.net supported versions page](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) it is a security risk and should be updated immediately.

### Newer PHP Versions

For PHP, the newest is not always the best. Substantial changes can arrive with major new versions of PHP and require extensive testing for both WordPress Core and Gravity Forms teams. We run a suite of tests against all major PHP updates, and that may also result in code changes for simple issues like closing warnings or deprecation messages or having to remove/replace code. This can take time. Before upgrading, look for articles such as those below to find details about Gravity Forms compatibility with the newest PHP versions.

- #### [Gravity Forms and PHP 8.5 Compatibility](https://docs.gravityforms.com/php-8-5-compatibility/)

- #### [Gravity Forms and PHP 8.4 Compatibility](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-and-php-8-4-compatibility/)

- #### [Gravity Forms and PHP 8.3 Compatibility](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-and-php-8-3-compatibility/)

- #### [Gravity Forms and PHP 8.2 Compatibility](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-and-php-8-2-compatibility/)

- #### [Gravity Forms and PHP 8.1 Compatibility](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-and-php-8-1-compatibility/)


## Older Environments

Gravity Forms may also work with some older versions of PHP and MySQL. Gravity Forms and official Gravity Forms Add-Ons are not tested with unsupported versions. Older versions may also expose your site to security vulnerabilities. See our article about [the importance of updates](https://docs.gravityforms.com/the-importance-of-updates/).

If you reach out for support, you may be required to upgrade before you can gain assistance.

**We do not fix issues found in older versions**. New solutions and features will always be added to the most recent Gravity Forms release only (and the version will then be updated accordingly).

**We highly recommend contacting your host to upgrade to the Preferred System Requirements.**
