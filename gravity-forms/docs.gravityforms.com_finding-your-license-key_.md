Please keep your license key secure. Abuse of your license key, even by a third party could result in it being inactivated or removed from our system, without the possibility of refund.

## How do I find my license key(s)?

To find your license key [log in](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/) and go to **Licenses & Downloads**. Refer to [this guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/account-overview/) if you need help navigating your account dashboard.

Here, you can see all of your license keys. There is also a copy button next to each key, which will copy the license key to your system clipboard.

## Where do I enter my license key?

### Pre-Requisites

- Ensure you have already [installed Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms/) on your WordPress site. You will need admin permission to your WordPress website.
- Ensure that the Gravity Forms plugin is active. (WordPress Dashboard → Plugins →  Activate Plugin for Gravity Forms)

### Steps

1. Navigate to [**Forms > Settings**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/access-your-form-settings/).
2. Under **General Settings**, paste your license key into the **Support License Key** field.
3. Click the **Save Settings** button at the bottom of the page.
4. If your license key has been activated, a green check mark will be displayed. If you don’t receive a green check mark, double-check the steps above or contact support for assistance.

## My license key would not validate!

Refer to the following knowledge base article for a list of possible validation errors, and next steps you can take to rectify them: [List of Gravity Forms license key validation errors](https://docs.gravityforms.com/license-key-validation-errors/).

## Replacing an Existing License Key

The process detailed above can be followed for a new website and also to replace an existing Gravity Forms license key with a new one on a website that is already up and running with Gravity Forms. As long as your new license key has the same or greater [features/tier](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-license-types/) as the existing key, you can replace it without any disruption to your forms.

If you are unsure what license tier you require, contact our Support team and include a copy of your system report. We will help you determine the best fit.

## What next?

For information on downloading plugins, setting up forms etc, refer to our [User Guides](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/), and especially the [Getting Started document area](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/getting-started/).
