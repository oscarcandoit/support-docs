|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_twilio_message_1'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 4 );` |

To target a specific form’s feed, append the form id and feed id to the hook name. (format: gform\_twilio\_message\_FORMID\_FEEDID)

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_twilio_message_1_1'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 4 );` |
