## Introduction

Sometimes you may find you have a Gravity Forms license key in use on your site, but do not know or cannot remember exactly which Gravity account that owns it. This prevents you from [logging in](https://gravity.com/) and performing account management operations like updating a payment method, as well as some license operations such as reviewing your site list or canceling an auto-renewal.

There are a couple of approaches you can use to try and find out the Gravity account.

## Finding A Gravity Account

The approach to finding an account depends on what information you have.

**Note:** We can not always identify a third-party owner to you due to our privacy policies related to customer data.

Using a Gravity Forms license key on your website does not mean you have the right to the Gravity account that holds that license key. The _account owner_ is defined as the owner of the email address the account is held under, and identifying information can only be provided to that validated user in most circumstances.

### I think I remember the Gravity account email…

If you have a few commonly used email addresses for sign-ups, then try using the Password Reset functionality on our Gravity account page to see if the account exists.

You can request a password reset email via the [account login page](https://gravity.com/login/) by clicking the Forgot Password link.

**Don’t forget** to check your Bulk or Spam folders. Password Reset emails often trigger spam checks and result in your legitimate request being dumped into an unseen Bulk or Suspicious folder by your email service.

Once you have reset the password and logged in you’ll be able to view your profile, licenses, and access the downloads here: [Gravity Account](https://gravity.com/) [.](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/)

### I have no clue as to what the account email might be…

You may have inherited a website with Gravity Forms installed from a previous employee, design agency or third party. This might mean that you have no idea what email address the account is held under.

We can search for your license key using some key data, and then identify the holding account.

To locate the owning account, contact the [General Questions](https://www.gravityforms.com/contact-us/) support channel for assistance and provide some of the following information.

| **If you know…** | **Then provide…** |
| --- | --- |
| The website where the license is active | The **URL** of the website where you believe the license is in use |
| The license key | The **full license key** |
| All of the following transaction details: | – Payment method (e.g. PayPal email or last 4 digits of the credit card)<br>– Transaction date<br>– Transaction amount<br>– Full name on the credit or debit card used |

From there, we can try to find the account by working backwards from the transaction.

### I used an agency or contractor to set up my website, and they never gave me the license

If you know the license is owned by a third party, then you will have to **reach out to them directly**. Only the account owner can perform certain operations, such as requesting technical support or [transferring](https://docs.gravityforms.com/transferring-your-license/) the license to you.

If you have no recollection of who you used, or no method to contact the site developer you think probably holds the license key, then we **recommend you purchase a new license and register it on your site**. This can be done without any disruption to your forms or form data, and is the only way to guarantee you have full control over your key moving forward.

You can purchase [on our website](https://www.gravityforms.com/pricing/). Be sure to obtain the license type that has access to all the [add-ons](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/) and meets the site count you require. For a quick comparison of license types, see [this help guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-license-types/).
