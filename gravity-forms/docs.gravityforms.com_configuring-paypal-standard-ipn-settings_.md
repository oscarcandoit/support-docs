# Configuring PayPal Standard IPN Settings

**Note:** PayPal will deprecate Website Payments Standard (WPS) in January 2026, with full End Of Life in January 2027. PayPal Payments Standard Add-On will be affected, and merchants must migrate to PayPal Checkout to maintain payment functionality. Refer to the [PayPal Payments Standard Add-On End Of Life](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=46377&action=edit) article for more information.

PayPal has announced that from September 2024, certain [legacy APIs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/deprecated-resources/) they provide will stop receiving support and customers using them may experience a loss of functionality. If you are using any of our Gravity Forms legacy PayPal Add-Ons ( [PayPal Payments Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-pro-add-on/), [PayPal Payments Standard Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-standard-add-on/), [PayPal Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-pro-add-on/)), we recommend you evaluate the feasibility of migrating to the PayPal Checkout Add-On to avoid possible disruption of services.

As of September 2016, the PayPal IPN will require SSL/HTTPS on all IPN callbacks. If you are using the PayPal IPN, you will need to obtain an SSL certificate.

When using the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On from Gravity Forms, PayPal talks to the add-on using IPN which simply lets Gravity Forms know that the payment has been processed by PayPal. In this article, we will show you how to set up your PayPal IPN to communicate with the Gravity Forms PayPal Payments Standard Add-On.

1. Log into your PayPal account.
2. To access your PayPal IPN settings, you may either:
   - Access the IPN settings page directly. Or:
   - From within your PayPal account, click on the account icon (looks like a gear) at the top right of the page, then click on **Profile and Settings**. Click the **My selling tools** menu item to the left of the page. Click on **Update** to the right of _Instant payment notifications_.
3. Click on the **Choose IPN Settings** button. [![paypal-ipn-1](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paypal-ipn-11-300x157.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paypal-ipn-11.png)
4. [![paypal-ipn-2](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paypal-ipn-2-300x122.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paypal-ipn-2.png) You will be prompted with a field labeled **Notification URL**. Enter the following, replacing _example.com_ with the domain that the Gravity Forms PayPal Payments Standard Add-On is installed.


`https://example.com/?callback=gravityformspaypal` (version 3.3.1+)



`https://example.com/?page=gf_paypal_ipn` (version 3.3 and older)

5. Select the radio button labeled **Receive IPN messages (Enabled)**.

6. Save your changes.

PayPal Standard IPN is now enabled. When a purchase is made, it will send a notification to the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On, letting it know that the payment was successful. If you need further information on using the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On within Gravity Forms, review our article on [setting up the PayPal Payments Standard Gravity Forms Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-paypal-payments-standard/).
