In July 2013 we moved from forum based support to a ticket based system, with the forums remaining read-only for reference. Since that time we have released more than dozens updates for Gravity Forms, many new add-ons, and numerous add-on updates.

All these updates do sadly mean that a lot of the information contained in the forums is now extremely dated and, in some cases, can cause more trouble than it’s worth. Also, since the demise of pastie.org many of the code snippets shared in the forums have also been lost.

For these reasons we phased out the forums soon after introducing our customer support ticketing system.

In 2018 though, we did introduce a community hub at the request of our dedicated advocates, our [Community Forum](https://community.gravityforms.com/). This is not an official support channel, but offers community-to-community conversation with folks who may have solved the problem you are faced with now!

## Gravity Forms Official Help Channels

- [Gravity Forms Support](https://www.gravityforms.com/support/) is staffed by our knowledgeable support engineers from around the world, and available to Gravity Forms valid license holders.
- Search the Gravity Forms documentation at [https://docs.gravityforms.com/](https://docs.gravityforms.com/)
- Ask your question on our [Community Forum](https://community.gravityforms.com/). This is not an official support channel, but offers community-to-community conversation with folks who may have already solved the problem you are faced with now!
