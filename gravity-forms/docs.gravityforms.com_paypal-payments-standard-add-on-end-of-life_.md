# PayPal Payments Standard Add-On End Of Life

- [What This Means for Gravity Forms Users](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-payments-standard-add-on-end-of-life/#h-what-this-means-for-gravity-forms-users)

## Overview

PayPal has announced the deprecation of Website Payments Standard (WPS), including the “Buy Now” and “Add to Cart” buttons, effective January 2026. This change impacts the Gravity Forms PayPal Payments Standard Add-On. To maintain uninterrupted payment processing by PayPal, migrate to the [PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypal-checkout-add-on/) as soon as possible.

## What This Means for Gravity Forms Users

The PayPal Payments Standard Add-On will cease to function after PayPal discontinues support for Website Payments Standard (WPS).

PayPal will end support for WPS integrations by **January 2026**, with only limited security updates provided until **January 2027**. After January 2027, **all WPS integrations will cease to function**, and **any payments processed through the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On will fail**.

The **Donations** and **Subscribe** buttons are **not affected** by this change.

To continue accepting payments, **ensure the** [PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypal-checkout-add-on/) **is active, configured, and using valid API credentials** as soon as possible.

## Migration to PayPal Checkout Add-On

The [PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypal-checkout-add-on/) replaces the legacy Website Payments Standard integration with a modern API that supports enhanced security, faster transaction processing, and an integrated user checkout experience. It includes support for Smart Payment Buttons, providing customers with flexible payment options, such as PayPal, Pay Later, and eligible debit or credit cards, directly within your form.

### How to Switch Existing Forms

Follow these steps to update your payment forms to use the PayPal Checkout Add-On:

1. Install, activate, and configure the PayPal Checkout Add-On. Start with our documentation [here](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-paypal-checkout-add-on/).
2. Edit a payment form and add the PayPal Checkout field below the form total. Save your changes.
3. Hover over **Settings** at the top and choose **PayPal Checkout**. Create a new feed or edit the existing one to confirm all settings are correct. For feed configuration details, see [Configuring a Feed for the PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-a-feed-for-the-paypal-checkout-add-on/).
4. Go to the PayPal Payments Standard feed screen and deactivate that feed by clicking the green **Active** button next to it.
5. Test your form to confirm that the payment process is correct.
6. Repeat these steps for any other forms using PayPal Payments Standard.

If you encounter any issues during migration or need help understanding configuration options, contact the [Gravity Forms support](http://gravityforms.com/support) team.
