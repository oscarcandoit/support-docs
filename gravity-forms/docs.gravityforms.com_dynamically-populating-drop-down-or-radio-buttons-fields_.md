## Introduction

Being able to dynamically populate the values in a select (aka drop down) field is fairly common requirement for product selection forms, product option forms, or any form that requires earlier submissions to drive choices in a latter collection field.

This walkthrough will teach you how to configure a specific example of this population, using custom code to present a list of existing posts as options in the drop down.

## Third Party Options

If you are not keen on custom code, or require more complex capabilities, check for **third party solutions** across popular WordPress Plug-In repositories, and in our very own [Community Add-On Library](https://www.gravityforms.com/community/).

Make sure you don’t miss the Add-On [Populate Anything](https://www.gravityforms.com/community/populate-anything/), a fully-featured offering from one of our Certified Developers, [GravityWiz](https://www.gravityforms.com/developers/gravity-wiz/).

## Custom Code Approach

The premise for this walkthrough is that we want to populate the options in a Gravity Form select field with all of the posts currently published on the site. There are a variety of reasons for wanting to do this, but in this example, we just want to know what the user’s favorite post is.

**IMPORTANT**: For obvious reasons, **dynamic** population can’t run when the page where your form is embedded is cached. This is not a Gravity Forms limitation but a consequence of using caching.

## The Code

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30 | `add_filter(``'gform_pre_render_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`add_filter(``'gform_pre_validation_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`add_filter(``'gform_pre_submission_filter_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`add_filter(``'gform_admin_pre_render_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`function``populate_posts(``$form``) {`<br>```foreach``(``$form``[``'fields'``]``as``&``$field``) {`<br>```if``(``$field``->type !=``'select'``||``strpos``(``$field``->cssClass,``'populate-posts'``) === false ) {`<br>```continue``;`<br>```}`<br>```// you can add additional parameters here to alter the posts that are retrieved`<br>```// more info: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts`<br>```$posts``= get_posts(``'numberposts=-1&post_status=publish'``);`<br>```$choices``=``array``();`<br>```foreach``(``$posts``as``$post``) {`<br>```$choices``[] =``array``(``'text'``=>``$post``->post_title,``'value'``=>``$post``->post_title );`<br>```}`<br>```// update 'Select a Post' to whatever you'd like the instructive option to be`<br>```$field``->placeholder =``'Select a Post'``;`<br>```$field``->choices =``$choices``;`<br>```}`<br>```return``$form``;`<br>`}` |

This code should be pasted in your theme’s _functions.php_ file.

## The Hooks

Using the [gform\_pre\_render](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_render) filter allows us to modify the form right before it is displayed. This is really useful, especially when you are looking to display content that will be constantly changing. In our case, this saves us the time and hassle of having to update our drop down of posts every time we add a new post. In addition you should use the [gform\_pre\_validation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_validation), [gform\_pre\_submission\_filter](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_submission_filter) and [gform\_admin\_pre\_render](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_admin_pre_render) filters as well.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4 | `add_filter(``'gform_pre_render_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`add_filter(``'gform_pre_validation_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`add_filter(``'gform_pre_submission_filter_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);`<br>`add_filter(``'gform_admin_pre_render_51'``,``'populate_posts'``);` |

This line tells Gravity Forms to filter the **$form** object through the **populate\_posts** function every time the form with ID of 51 is displayed. You should update the 51 here to the ID of your form.

**Please note**: A form-specific version of the [gform\_pre\_validation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_validation/) filter was added in Gravity Forms version 1.9.

Next, let’s create a **populate\_posts** function to modify our form.

## Custom Filter Function

In this example, our custom filter function is titled “populate\_posts”. Since we told Gravity Forms to call this function from the [gform\_pre\_render](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_render) filter, Gravity Forms will also send the **$form** object as a parameter to this function. This means we can modify the **$form** object with this function and then return our changes at the end of the function.

## Looping Through the Fields

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `foreach``(``$form``[``'fields'``]``as``$field``) { ... }` |

Since we have the **$form** object, let’s loop through the fields in the form and find the field(s) that we’d like to modify.

| 1<br>2<br>3 | `if``(``$field``->type !=``'select'``||``strpos``(``$field``->cssClass,``'populate-posts'``) === false ) {`<br>```continue``;`<br>`}` |

Given our premise, we only want to modify fields that are select (drop down) fields AND have a CSS class titled “populate-posts”. We _could_ check for the field ID instead of a CSS class; however, if we ever change our form we’d have to update the code to match the new field ID. Using a CSS class to identify our desired field allows us to manage which field should be targeted right from the Gravity Forms admin.

If the current field we are at in the loop is not a select OR does not have our designated CSS class, we simply skip that field and move on to the next.

## Get the Posts

Now it’s time to get an array of all the posts to display in our drop down.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$posts``= get_posts(``'numberposts=-1'``);` |

**get\_posts()** is a WordPress function that returns an array of posts based on the parameters you provide it. For more information on how to modify which posts are returned, [read here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts).

**Quick Tip:** You can retrieve any kind of post type here; even custom post types. Just pass the name of your post type with the “post\_type” parameter:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$posts``= get_posts(``'post_type=event&numberposts=-1'``);` |

## Creating an Array of Choices

The way Gravity Forms handles fields with multiple options (such as a select field) is with a “choices” property for the field which contains an array of “options”. Each option consists of:

- a “text” property (which is what the user will see in the drop down)
- a “value” property (which is what will be recorded by Gravity Forms)
- an “isSelected” property (which is used to indicate whether the option is currently selected or not)
- and a “price” property (which only applies to pricing fields)

In our scenario, we are only concerned with the “text” and “value” properties.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$choices``=``array``();` |

The first thing we do is create an array to store all of our options.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `foreach``(``$posts``as``$post``) {`<br>```$choices``[] =``array``(``'text'``=>``$post``->post_title,``'value'``=>``$post``->post_title );`<br>`}` |

Next, we’re going to loop through the posts we retrieved using the **get\_posts()** function and create an option array for each post. For the “text” property we will use the Post Title and for the “value” property we will use the same. In some cases you may want to collect the ID of the selected post. If so you’d use $post->ID instead of $post->post\_title; however, for our goal of recording the users favorite post, the post title is sufficient.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$field``->choices =``$choices``;` |

Once we’ve looped through all of the posts and created all of our options, we assign the **$choices** array (which has all of our new options) to the **$field** _choices_ property.

## Add a Placeholder Choice

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$field``->placeholder =``'Select a Post'``;` |

We also want to make the first option in the drop down a “placeholder” choice. It let’s the user know what they are supposed to do with this drop down (ie “Select a Post”). We do this by assigning the choice text to the fields placeholder property.

When the drop down is rendered on the form the placeholder choice will have an empty value for the “value” property. This ensures that if this is a required field, that the user must select an option other than the placeholder option. Failing to do so will generate a validation error.

## What about Checkboxes?

Checkbox fields can also be dynamically populated, but they require additional handling since their structure is created by a fieldset of inputs and choices. See this [example code for Dynamically Populating a Checkbox](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_render/#2-populate-choices-checkboxes) as included in our [gform\_pre\_render](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_pre_render/) documentation.

## Conclusion

That’s all there is to it! When you view your form on the front end you should now see that your select field is populated with a list of all your current posts.

This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
