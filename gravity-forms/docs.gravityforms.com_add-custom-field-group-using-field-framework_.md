# How to Add a Custom Field Group when Using the Field Framework

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/add-custom-field-group-using-field-framework/#h-introduction)
- [The add\_button() method](https://docs.gravityforms.com/add-custom-field-group-using-field-framework/#h-the-add_button-method)

## Introduction

Back in the day you could use the [gform\_add\_field\_buttons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_add_field_buttons) filter to add the buttons for custom fields and add custom field groups.

With the introduction of the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class adding a field to an existing group is a simple as overriding the get\_form\_editor\_button() method. But what about adding the field button to a custom group?

Introducing the add\_button() method.

## The add\_button() method

GF\_Field::add\_button() is responsible for adding the field button to the group specified in the array returned by get\_form\_editor\_button(), however, if the group does not exist the button won’t be added.

If you were to use the [gform\_add\_field\_buttons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_add_field_buttons) filter to add your custom group you would find the group is added but your new field isn’t added to the group, that’s because the filter runs after the fields are added to the groups. You could update your function hooked to the [gform\_add\_field\_buttons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_add_field_buttons) filter to also add the button to the group but what would be the fun in that.

The following example shows how you can override the add\_button() method to include a custom group if it doesn’t already exist.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12 | `/**`<br>```* Adds the field button to the specified group.`<br>```*`<br>```* @param array $field_groups The field groups containing the individual field buttons.`<br>```*`<br>```* @return array`<br>```*/`<br>`public``function``add_button(``$field_groups``) {`<br>```$field_groups``=``$this``->maybe_add_field_group(``$field_groups``);`<br>```return``parent::add_button(``$field_groups``);`<br>`}` |

And here’s the function which actually performs the check and then returns the updated array of groups.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23 | `/**`<br>```* Adds the custom field group if it doesn't already exist.`<br>```*`<br>```* @param array $field_groups The field groups containing the individual field buttons.`<br>```*`<br>```* @return array`<br>```*/`<br>`public``function``maybe_add_field_group(``$field_groups``) {`<br>```foreach``(``$field_groups``as``$field_group``) {`<br>```if``(``$field_group``[``'name'``] ==``'your_custom_group_name'``) {`<br>```return``$field_groups``;`<br>```}`<br>```}`<br>```$field_groups``[] =``array``(`<br>```'name'``=>``'your_custom_group_name'``,`<br>```'label'``=> __(``'The Group Label'``,``'simplefieldaddon'``),`<br>```'fields'``=>``array``()`<br>```);`<br>```return``$field_groups``;`<br>`}` |

Now when you your get\_form\_editor\_button() function looks like this your field button will be added to the custom group.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11 | `/**`<br>```* Assign the field button to the custom group.`<br>```*`<br>```* @return array`<br>```*/`<br>`public``function``get_form_editor_button() {`<br>```return``array``(`<br>```'group'``=>``'your_custom_group_name'``,`<br>```'text'``=>``$this``->get_form_editor_field_title(),`<br>```);`<br>`}` |
