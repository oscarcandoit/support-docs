# Deprecation of Google’s Universal Analytics

- [Deprecation details](https://docs.gravityforms.com/deprecation-of-google-universal-analytics/#h-deprecation-details)
- [Implications for Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On Users](https://docs.gravityforms.com/deprecation-of-google-universal-analytics/#h-implications-for-gravity-forms-google-analytics-add-on-users)
- [Gravity Forms Google Analytics Version 2.0](https://docs.gravityforms.com/deprecation-of-google-universal-analytics/#h-gravity-forms-google-analytics-version-2-0)
- [Continuing With Universal Analytics](https://docs.gravityforms.com/deprecation-of-google-universal-analytics/#h-continuing-with-universal-analytics)

## Deprecation details

On July 1, 2023, Google’s **Universal Analytics** (UA) properties will **stop processing data**. Refer to this [support section from Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en) for more information. To continue gathering site analytics this way, and in line with Google’s recommendations, sites must be switched to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) before that date. We have released Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On version 2.0 to facilitate this change.

## Implications for Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On Users

Users of the [Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/google-analytics-add-on/) before version 2.0 have been using the add-on in combination with **Google Tag Manager** (GTM) to send data to **GA4**. With Gravity Forms Google Analytics version 2.0, **GTM** is no longer required to send data to **GA4**.

With Gravity Forms Google Analytics version 2.0, users can send data using any of the three connection methods. **All users will need to reauthenticate and upgrade their feeds to continue sending data**, regardless of the connection method used.

Failure to update to version 2.0 of the Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On before the deprecation date may result in your Google Analytics feeds failing.

## Gravity Forms Google Analytics Version 2.0

**Version 2.0** of the Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On will account for the deprecation of UA properties by allowing the sending of GA4-compatible data with all three possible connection types: Google Analytics, Google Measurement Protocol, and Google Tag Manager.

Google Analytics Add-On users must update to version 2.0 and refresh their feeds to utilize the new properties.

## Continuing With Universal Analytics

Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On version 2.0 will not be compatible with Universal Analytics. If you wish to continue sending Universal Analytics data, do not update Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On to ensure you stay on a version of the add-on before 2.0. Note, however, that Google’s UA service will **no longer receive data** after July 1, 2023. From then, your UA analytics feeds will fail regardless of the version of the add-on you’re using.
