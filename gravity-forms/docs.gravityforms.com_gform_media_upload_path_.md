## Description

This filter can be used to change the location where files uploaded using the Post Image field are copied to when the post is created.

## Usage

The following would apply to all forms.

```
add_filter( 'gform_media_upload_path', 'your_function_name', 10, 3 );
```

To limit the scope of your function to a specific form, append the form id to the end of the hook name. (format: gform\_media\_upload\_path\_FORMID)

```
add_filter( 'gform_media_upload_path_5', 'your_function_name', 10, 3 );
```

## Parameters

- **$upload\_dir** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)
The upload directory path and url to be filtered.

  - **$upload\_dir\[‘path’\]** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
    Full physical path to the folder.

  - **$upload\_dir\[‘url’\]** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    Full URL to the folder.
- **$form\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The ID of the form currently being processed.

- **$post\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The ID of the post created from the entry currently being processed.


## Examples

### 1\. Log the current path

You can use this example with [logging enabled](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-and-debugging/) to find out what the current path is before using the next example to change the path.

```
add_filter( 'gform_media_upload_path', function ( $upload_dir, $form_id ) {
    GFCommon::log_debug( "gform_media_upload_path(): upload_dir for form #{$form_id} =&amp;gt; " . print_r( $upload_dir, true ) );

    return $path_info;
}, 1, 2 );
```

### 2\. Change the path and url

This example changes the upload path and url for the File Upload field.

```
add_filter( 'gform_media_upload_path', 'change_media_upload_path', 10, 3 );
function change_media_upload_path( $upload_dir, $form_id, $post_id ) {
   $upload_dir['path'] = '/home/public_html/yourdomainfolder/new/path/';
   $upload_dir['url'] = 'http://yourdomainhere.com/new/path/';

   return $upload_dir;
}
```

## Placement

## Source Code
