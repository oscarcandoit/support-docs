# Polls Block

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/polls-block/#h-introduction)
- [Inserting the Block](https://docs.gravityforms.com/polls-block/#h-inserting-the-block)
- [Polls Block Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/polls-block/#h-polls-block-settings)
- [Additional Options](https://docs.gravityforms.com/polls-block/#h-additional-options)

## Introduction

You can add a Poll or display Poll Results within a page or post using the [WP5 block editor](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-a-gravity-form-using-wordpress-5/), and the “Poll” block that is automatically included when you install the Polls add-on.

The block editor is a feature of WordPress 5+, and the Poll Block was introduced in Polls add-on v3.3

## Inserting the Block

The Poll block is inserted like any other block, and can be found under the Embeds section. Refer to [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/?p=22325&preview=true) for instructions on the various methods available to add a block.

## Polls Block Settings

When adding the Poll block, there are some Mode and Appearance settings that you are able to configure. Make sure you have the Gravity Forms + Polls block selected, and the settings will show on the right side inspector.

[![Polls Block Mode Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.08.26.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.08.26.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Mode** | Choose from the drop down to select either:<br>**Poll**: display the poll fields, allowing users to enter their choices.<br>**Results**: only displaying poll results, and do not accept any more submissions. |
| **Style** | Specifies the primary color of the bar chart when displaying the poll results. Default: Green. |
| **Display Results Percentages** | Displays the poll results as percentages at the left side of the bar chart. Enabled by default. See example image A. |
| **Display Number of Votes For Each Selection** | Display the number of votes for each poll selection at the rightmost side of the bar chart for each possible answer. Enabled by default. See example image B. |
| **Display Link to Results Below Form** | Display a link below the form to the poll results within the page. That results page will also offer a link at bottom to return the user back to the poll form. Enabled by default. See example image C. |
| **Display Results Upon Submission** | Display the poll results immediately after form submission. Enabled by default. |
