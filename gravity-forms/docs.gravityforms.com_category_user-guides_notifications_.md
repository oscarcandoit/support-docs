# Notifications

Notifications are a way to notiy and send information after a form submission. Most commonly they are used to email interested parties, such as a website administrator, a support analyst, or even just the form submitter. Typical uses include admin alerts, user receipts, and payment lifecycle notices.

Notification content can be enhanced with merge tags, attach uploaded files, and add query strings or UTM parameters for analytics.Notifications support conditional logic to enable you to send different notifications (or none) based on additional criteria.

For a quick start guide, refer to the Getting Started section titled [Confirmations and Notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmations-and-notifications/).
