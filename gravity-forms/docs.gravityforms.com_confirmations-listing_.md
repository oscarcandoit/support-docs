## Listing

The Confirmations List Page lets you see all the confirmations for a particular form. Hovering over the confirmation name reveals the quick toolbar confirmation actions, each of which is described below:

[![Image showing Confirmations List Page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1-1024x325.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png)

## Quick Toobar Actions

| **Quick Action** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Active/Inactive** | **Active** sets the current confirmation to use. **Inactive** means the confirmation exists but is not currently in use. |
| **Edit** | Allows you to make modifications to your confirmations. |
| **Duplicate** | Creates a copy of the entire confirmation. |
| **Delete** | Permanently removes the confirmation. This action cannot be undone. |

## Confirmation Columns

| **Column** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The name of your confirmation. The list may be sorted alphabetically by clicking the column header. |
| **Type** | Lists the type of confirmation. **Text** will display your entered text. **Page** links to the WordPress page you specified. **Redirect** sends users to the provided URL. See _Confirmation Settings_ for details. |
| **Content** | Displays the information included in the specified type. Example: **Type** = Redirect, **Content** = http://www.google.com. |

## Editing A Confirmation

For information on configuring a confirmation, refer to [this help article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-confirmations/).

## Default Confirmation

[![Image showing Default Confirmation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x558.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png)

Every form must always process one confirmation, so the Default Confirmation cannot be deleted, removed, or set to inactive. If you want to show a custom confirmation message, you can edit the **Default Confirmation** or create a new one with conditional logic. When no other confirmation’s logic is met, the **Default Confirmation** will be used.
