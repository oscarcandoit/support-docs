**Important:** Authorize.net is a legacy add-on. It will not be receiving further updates. We recommend switching to an alternative payment add-on, such as [Stripe](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/stripe-add-on/), [PayPal Checkout](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypal-checkout-add-on/), [Square](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/square-add-on/), or [Mollie](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/mollie-add-on/).

## Summary

To send information from your Gravity Forms form to Authorize.Net, you will first need to create [a feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/what-is-a-feed/). A feed simply allows form submission data to be sent to another source. In this instance, payment data being sent to Authorize.Net. This article describes the steps to create a basic feed to Authorize.Net.

**Note**: To use the Authorize.Net Add-On, you will need a [Credit Card field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/credit-card-field-2/) within your form. When using Page fields to create a multi-page form, the Credit Card field should be located on the last page of the form.

## Create a Feed

To create a feed to Authorize.Net using the Authorize.Net Add-On for Gravity Forms, do the following from your WordPress Admin Dashboard:

1. Click on **Forms** in the left side menu.
2. Select the form that you want to use with Authorize.Net.
3. Once within your desired form, hover over **Settings** and click on **Authorize.Net**.
4. Click **Add New** to create a new feed. You will be presented with the Authorize.Net feed settings screen. See the table below for a quick summary of all settings presented. Choosing some options will reveal additional settings.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the section as required.

You can create **multiple** Authorize.Net feeds for your form, however you must configure conditional logic (see [Other Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-authorize-net-add-on/#h-feed-settings-other-settings) section) on each of them to make their trigger conditions unique. The add-on will only process one feed during submission. If conditional logic is not configured, it will use the first feed it finds.

## Feed Settings • Basics

![authorize.net feed setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/authnet-feed1-1-1024x449.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Uniquely identifies the feed in your feed list page. **Required**. |
| **Transaction Type** | Options are **Products and Services** or **Subscription**. Products and Services are standard one time sales, while Subscription transaction types are for recurring payments. See notes below for additional settings that are revealed dependent upon your transaction type. |

## Feed Settings • Transaction Settings

Choices offered here depend upon the transaction type chosen in the basic settings.

[![authorize.net feed setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/authnet-feed2a.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/authnet-feed2a.png)

[![authorize.net feed setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/authnet-feed3b.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/authnet-feed3b.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Payment Amount** | For Products and Services transaction types, this defines what field the order total will be based on. |
| **Recurring Amount** | Define the product field that will determine the recurring payment amount. Select _Form Total_ to use the total of all pricing fields. |
| **Billing Cycle** | How often the recurring payment should occur. |
| **Recurring Times** | How many times the recurring payment should occur. By default the customer is billed until the subscription is canceled. |
| **Setup Fee** | Specifies which product field is used as the setup fee. This is a one-time charge made during the initial billing. Trial cannot be used with this option. |
| **Trial** | Enables a trial period. The user’s recurring payment will not begin until after this trial period. The trial duration is one billing cycle. For example, if you configure a subscription which recurs every month, the user will have a one month trial. Setup Fee cannot be used with this option. |

## Feed Settings • Other Settings

![authorize.net feed setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/authnet-feed4.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Billing Information** | Map each of the Authorize.Net fields to the applicable form field that will contain that information. |
| **Send Authorize.Net email receipt** | Sends a receipt via email to the user’s email address. |
| **Enable Condition** | If unchecked, every successful form submission will be sent to Authorize.Net. If you wish to set specific conditions for sending form data, then check “Enable Condition” and fill out your required criteria.<br>See also [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enabling-conditional-logic-for-feeds/) on conditional logic basics. |
| **Override Default Settings** | Ignore the settings on the Authorize.Net settings page by specifying an alternate mode and API login ID/transaction key. |

## Viewing Sales Results

After creating a feed and making your first sale, you can view the results on the Sales Results page.  Review [Viewing Sales Results](https://docs.gravityforms.com/viewing-sales-results/) article for more information.
