### WordPress.com Marketplace

Gravity Forms and its add-ons are also offered through [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) as part of their premium plugin marketplace. Those licenses are purchased directly through [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/),  and are only available for use on their site hosting plans. They are bought, managed, utilized, and supported solely via that platform, and a [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) license will _not_ appear in your Gravity Account.

For more information, see [this WordPress.com article](https://wordpress.com/plugins/gravityforms) or contact your [WordPress.com support](https://wordpress.com/support/) resource.

## Legacy License Types

- Gravity Forms **Personal** Legacy License
- Gravity Forms **Business** Legacy License
- Gravity Forms **Developer** Legacy License

These licenses were offered in the early days of Gravity Forms, but are no longer for sale. For those customers who had previously purchased them, we do allow upgrades to current licenses, as well as permitting them to continue maintaining an active legacy license by keeping up to date with all renewal payments. Refer to [our Legacy License FAQ](https://docs.gravityforms.com/legacy-license-faq/) for all the details regarding the legacy license types.
