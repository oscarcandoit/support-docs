## Introduction

The Signature Add-On for Gravity Forms allows you to capture signatures online by allowing users to sign your forms using touchscreen devices, touchpads, or a mouse by adding a new field to the Advanced Fields toolbox in the Form Editor.

Quickly and easily integrate signature capabilities into your forms without the end user having to install any special browser plugins.

With the Gravity Forms Signature Add-On you can provide a very simple user interface for allowing users to sign your forms online. It captures signature information as it is drawn and sends data to your web server where this information is converted into a PNG image and stored on your server. This happens on-the-fly as soon as the user signs the field canvas.

The Signature Add-On works on all major desktop and mobile browsers. This includes IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, iOS, Android, Blackberry, and WebOS.

## Pre-Requisites

[Setup the Signature Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/signature-add-on/)

## Configuring the Signature Field

After installing the Signature Add-On you will see a new field type added to the Advanced Fields toolbox in the Form Editor when creating or editing a Gravity Form.

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **New Form** under the Forms navigation or edit an existing form from **Forms**.
2. Add a **Signature** field to your form from the Advanced Fields toolbox.
3. Edit this new Signature field and configure the field options to your liking. Under **Appearance** you can change the color, size, background, border, and style.
4. Save your form.
5. Capture signatures!

## Entry Details

When you view the Entry Details for a Form Entry that contains a Signature field, you will see the signature included in the entry details. The signature will be presented as a thumbnail image and you can click on the thumbnail to see the full size version of the signature itself.

## Email Notifications

The signature thumbnail, which is linked to the full-sized signature on your website, will be included in the email notification when using the {all\_fields} merge tag. You can also include the captured signature image in the email notification using the individual field merge tag, and an HTML <img> tag:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `<img src=``"{Your Signature:8}"``title=``"Signature"``/>` |

If you would like to **prevent** the inclusion of the signature image in the notification (when using the `{all_fields}` merge tag) please use the [gform\_signature\_show\_in\_all\_fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_signature_show_in_all_fields/) filter.

## How Does It Work?

The Gravity Forms Signature Add-On is powered by the well-established signature capture software SuperSignature. The SuperSignature technology and source code have been licensed by rocketgenius, inc. for redistribution as an official Gravity Forms Add-On.
