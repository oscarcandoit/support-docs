# Setting Up a Legacy Zapier Zap

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-your-zapier-zap/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-your-zapier-zap/#h-introduction)
- [Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-your-zapier-zap/#h-setup)

This guide applies to Zaps created with the legacy Zapier Gravity Forms Application. New Zaps created within Zapier with Gravity Forms (as either a trigger or an action) will look different now. Additionally, web hooks and feed setting are not required under the new REST API authentication. We are working on an updated version of this guide, but until then, please refer to the official [Zapier documentation](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/create-zaps).

## Pre-Requisites

[Setup the Zapier add-on](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-zapier-add-on/)

## Introduction

Zapier is an add-on that allows you to trigger an action upon submission of a form. Unlike some other plugins, Zapier does not require an API key to be configured, making this one of the easiest plugins to set up. All that needs to be done is create a form and map a feed.

## Setup

If you would like to use a pre-existing form, you may skip to step 2. However, if you have not already created a form, you will need to create one in order to integrate the Zapier Add-On with Gravity Forms.

01. Create your form. No specific fields are required.
02. Create your **Zap**. Begin by logging in to your Zapier account. If you do not have an account, you can [sign up for one here](https://zapier.com/sign-up/).
03. Click the **Make a Zap!** button located in the header of Zapier’s site.

    ![Zapier Make A Zap Button](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Make-A-Zap-Button.png)
04. Select **Gravity Forms** as your trigger application.

    ![Zapier Choose A Trigger App](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Choose-A-Trigger-App.png)
05. Then select **New Form Submission** as the trigger.

    ![select gravity forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gravityformstrigger.png)
06. Click the **Save + Continue** button.
07. You will then be presented with the step to **Pick A Sample To Set Up Your Zap**. Directions on how to do this are displayed on the page and in the next few steps of this article.

08. Before you can click the **“OK, I did this”** button, you must set up your feed in Gravity Forms and add the displayed URL to your feed as the Webhook URL. To do this, go to the **Settings** for your form and select **Zapier**.

    ![Zapier Feeds List Page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Feeds-List-Page-1.png)
09. Click the **Add New** button.
10. Fill out the feed settings. First enter a **Zap Name**. Then copy the URL displayed on Zapier’s website into the **Webhook URL**. Next, mark the Zap as **Active**. Lastly, click the **Save Zapier Feed** button. Once you save the feed, the form fields and sample data are sent to Zapier which populates the fields available for use with the application to which you choose to send your data. For more information on setting up the feed, please see the [Creating A Feed For The Zapier Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-your-zapier-feed/) article.

    ![fill out feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/add_new_zapier_feed.png)
11. Return to your setup on Zapier’s site and click the **OK, I did this** button.

    [![Zapier Settings Test Zap Sample](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Settings-Test-Zap-Sample2-284x300.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Settings-Test-Zap-Sample2.png)
12. The form submission pulled by the Zap will display. Click **Continue**.

13. You will see **Almost finished here!** Click the link to add the **Action** step.

    ![Zapier Almost Finished Here](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Almost-Finished-Here.png)
14. Select your **Action App** and which action you wish to use. The action app is simply the application with which you want your submitted data to interact. In this example, we will be using **Gmail**. Each application has its own actions and steps to configure. If additional help is needed setting up the trigger or action application, check out [Zapier’s documentation page](https://zapier.com/help/).

    ![Zapier Choose An Action App](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Choose-An-Action-App.png)
15. Select the action you would like to happen when the form is submitted. In this case, we will be sending an email.

    ![Zapier Select App Action](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Zapier-Select-App-Action.png)
16. Click the **Save + Continue** button.
17. Finish the steps as necessary to configure your action app.
18. Test your action by clicking the **Send Test** button.
19. Once the testing is successful, click the **Finish** button.
20. Now it’s time to name your Zap, and turn it on.

    Congratulations! You have successfully created a Zap!
