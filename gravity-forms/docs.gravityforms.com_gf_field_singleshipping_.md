## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_SingleShipping class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Single Method Shipping field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the admin label`<br>`$admin_label``=``$field``->adminLabel;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **base\_price\_setting**


Determines whether the “Price” section displays. This allows a base price to be specified for shipping.

### Properties

Below is a listing of the properties inherited from the parent class and ones specific to the field.

- **adminLabel** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The label to be used on admin pages instead of the label, useful for fields with long labels.

- **allowsPrepopulate** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the field values can be dynamically populated. Default is false.

- **basePrice** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The shipping price. The value includes the formatting characters.

- **conditionalLogic** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object) for more details.

- **cssClass** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom CSS class or classes to be added to the input tag for the field.

- **description** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field description.

- **descriptionPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The placement of the field description. The description may be placed “above” or “below” the field inputs. If the placement is not specified, then the description placement setting for the Form Layout is used.

- **formId** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The form ID.

- **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The field ID.

- **inputName** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The parameter name used when dynamically populating the field.

- **inputType** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Used when the field has a sub-type. This is set to **singleshipping**. The type property will be set to **shipping**.

- **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages.

- **type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field type. This is set to **shipping**. The inputType property is set to **singleshipping**.
