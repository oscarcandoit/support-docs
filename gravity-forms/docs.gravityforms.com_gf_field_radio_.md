# GF\_Field\_Radio

- [Settings and Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_radio/#h-settings-and-properties)
- [Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_radio/#h-settings)

## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_Radio class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Radio Button field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission. This class also handles the Product, Product Option, and Shipping fields rendering when the field is a radio button.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the admin label`<br>`$admin_label``=``$field``->adminLabel;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **admin\_label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Admin Field Label” setting appears.

- **choices\_setting**


Determines whether the “Choices” setting displays. This section allows you to create different radio button selections and set associated values to each one. It also allows you to choose from a pre-defined set of data that may be used to create the radio buttons. Without this section, the radio button selections are limited to “First Choice”, “Second Choice” and “Third Choice” and may not be changed in the editor.

- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.

- **css\_class\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom CSS Class” setting displays. This allows a custom css to be used for the field.

- **description\_setting**


Controls whether the “Description” setting appears. This allows a description for the field to be displayed.

- **duplicate\_setting**


Controls whether the “No Duplicates” setting displays within the “Rules” section. This controls whether the same value may exist more than once in the database. The “Rules” setting must be active for this to display.

- **error\_message\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom Validation Message” setting which allows a custom message to be used appears.

- **label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.

- **other\_choice\_setting**


Determines whether the “Enable “other” choice” setting displays. When checked, this creates a final text input as Other and allows the user to enter their own text.

- **prepopulate\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Allow field to be populated dynamically” setting appears.

- **rules\_setting**


Controls whether the “Rules” settings section displays. The “Required” option shows when this is active.

- **visibility\_setting**


Controls whether the “Visibility” setting displays. The controls whether the option of visibility being for “Everyone” or “Admin Only” can be set.


### Properties

Below is a listing of the properties inherited from the parent class and ones specific to the field.

- **adminLabel** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The label to be used on admin pages instead of the label, useful for fields with long labels.

- **adminOnly** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines whether the field is visible to the user submitting the form, or only visible in the admin.

- **allowsPrepopulate** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the field values can be dynamically populated. Default is false.

- **choices** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array containing the the individual properties for each radio button item.
  - **text** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
    The text that is displayed

  - **value** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    The value that is used for the radio button when the form is submitted.

  - **isSelected** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

    Indicates whether the radio button item is selected

  - **isOtherChoice** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

    Indicates the radio button item is the “Other” choice.

  - **price** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    Used when the radio button is a Product, Product Option, or Shipping Field and contains the item price.

Below is what the output would look like:

```
$choices = array(
    array(
        'text'          => 'First Choice',
        'value'         => 'one',
        'isSelected'    => false,
        'price'         => '$5.00' //only populated if a product, product option or shipping field
    ),
    array(
        'text'          => 'Second Choice',
        'value'         => 'two',
        'isSelected'    => true,
        'price'         => ''
    ),
    array(
        'text'          => 'Third Choice',
        'value'         => 'three',
        'isSelected'    => false,
        'price'         => ''
    ),
    array(
        'text'          => 'Other',
        'value'         => 'gf_other_choice',
        'isSelected'    => false,
        'isOtherChoice' => true
    )
)
```

- **conditionalLogic** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)
An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object) for more details.

- **description** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field description.

- **descriptionPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The placement of the field description. The description may be placed “above” or “below” the field inputs. If the placement is not specified, then the description placement setting for the Form Layout is used.

- **enableChoiceValue** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates whether the “show values” option within the “Choices” section of the editor is checked.

- **enableOtherChoice** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates whether the “Enable “other” choice” option is checked in the editor.

- **enablePrice** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

This property is used when the radio button is a product option field and will be set to true. If not associated with a product, then it is false.

- **errorMessage** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom error message to be displayed if the field fails validation.

For instance, when the radio button is a Product, Product Option, or Shipping field, then the “type” is set to **product** when a Product field, **option** when a Product Option and **shipping** when a Shipping field. The “inputType” is set to **radio**. When the field is created, the type is initially set using the “type” property. If “inputType” is not empty, then the “inputType” property is used to create the field instead.

- **isRequired** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Marking the field as required will prevent the form from being submitted if the user does not enter a value. Default is false.

- **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages.

- **noDuplicates** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the value entered by the user may already exist in the database.

- **productField** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)
