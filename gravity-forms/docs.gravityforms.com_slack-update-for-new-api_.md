# Slack Update for New API

- [Summary](https://docs.gravityforms.com/slack-update-for-new-api/#h-summary)
- [Deprecated Features from prior Slack APIs](https://docs.gravityforms.com/slack-update-for-new-api/#h-deprecated-features-from-prior-slack-apis)

## Summary

If you have an older version of the Gravity Forms Slack Add-on (prior to v1.13), you will not be able to make a connection to Slack as the API used in those older versions has been retired by Slack and is no longer available.

If you are on a more current version of Slack, starting with Slack v2.1.0 authentication to Slack requires **[connecting the Gravity Forms Slack APP within your Slack Organization to a specific channel](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-slack-add/)**. You’ll know if you need to authenticate again if you see the following notice under Forms > Settings > Slack:

![Slack Banner Notice advising that you will need to re-authenticate your connection with Slack as part of the Gravity Forms Slack Add-On.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Slack-Add-On-Reauthenticate-Notice-1024x92.png)

This notice indicates that “Slack is updating their API to be more granular in scope, which requires re-authentication. Please disconnect and reconnect to re-authenticate with Slack and ensure the continued functionality of your feeds”.

Once you’ve connected to your Slack Organization, you will see the following message under **Form Settings** \> **Slack** showing that you are “Signed into Slack team” with your Slack Organization name:

![Slack Settings showing connected Slack Organization under Slack Add-On for Gravity Forms.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Slack-Add-On-Showing-connected-Slack-Organization-1024x281.png)

## Deprecated Features from prior Slack APIs

Previous versions of our Slack Add-On offered the ability to invite to Teams within your Slack Organization, which relied on a legacy API endpoint and the [admin scope of a legacy API token](https://api.slack.com/legacy/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens#capabilities). These APIs are no longer available at Slack.

Under the current Slack API and tokens, the endpoints offered for this feature are now only available to Slack Enterprise Grid accounts.
