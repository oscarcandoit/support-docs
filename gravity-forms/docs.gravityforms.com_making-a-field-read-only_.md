## Introduction

Sometimes, making a field read-only can be helpful, allowing you to utilize that field for a dynamic display of various messages. If you want to change a field to read-only, you must use JavaScript. The following filter and function will help you accomplish this.

## Native (Code) Solution

First, you must add a custom class to your field’s **Custom CSS Class** setting to easily target it. We will use a class named **gf\_readonly** to **target the field correctly**, but you can use a different class if you prefer.

We will use JavaScript to apply the `readonly` attribute to the targeted field type.

### Targeting a Paragraph Text field

|     |
| --- |
| `document.addEventListener(``'gform/postRender'``, (event) => {`<br>````const form = gform.utils.getNode(`````#gform_${event.detail.formId}`, document, true);``<br>```const textareas = Array.from(gform.utils.getNodes(``'.gf_readonly textarea'``,``false``, form,``true``));`<br>```textareas.forEach(textarea => {`<br>```textarea.readOnly =``true``;`<br>```});`<br>`});` |

### Targeting other fields using a text input

This will work for other field types where the HTML input is set to text, such as a Date Picker field.

|     |
| --- |
| `document.addEventListener(``'gform/postRender'``, (event) => {`<br>````const form = gform.utils.getNode(`````#gform_${event.detail.formId}`, document, true);``<br>```const inputs = Array.from(gform.utils.getNodes(``'.gf_readonly input'``,``false``, form,``true``));`<br>```inputs.forEach(input => {`<br>```input.readOnly =``true``;`<br>```});`<br>`});` |

### Targeting checkboxes fields

|     |
| --- |
| `document.addEventListener(``'gform/postRender'``, (event) => {`<br>````const form = gform.utils.getNode(`````#gform_${event.detail.formId}`, document, true);``<br>```const checkboxes = Array.from(gform.utils.getNodes(``'.gf_readonly input[type=checkbox]'``,``false``, form,``true``));`<br>```checkboxes.forEach(checkbox => {`<br>```checkbox.addEventListener(``'click'``, (event) => event.preventDefault());`<br>```});`<br>`});` |

### Targeting radio button fields

|     |
| --- |
| `document.addEventListener(``'gform/postRender'``, (event) => {`<br>````const form = gform.utils.getNode(`````#gform_${event.detail.formId}`, document, true);``<br>```const radioButtons = Array.from(gform.utils.getNodes(``'.gf_readonly input[type=radio]'``,``false``, form,``true``));`<br>```radioButtons.forEach(radio => {`<br>```radio.addEventListener(``'click'``, (event) => event.preventDefault());`<br>```});`<br>`});` |

## Placement

Reference the article [Adding JavaScript Code to the Frontend of Your Site](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-javascript-code-to-the-frontend-of-your-site/).

## Third Party Plugin Solution

If you don’t want to implement this using code, remember that third-party plug-ins have often solved common problems for you.

For read-only functionality, check out this well-known third-party plug-in by the Gravity Wiz team: [GP Read Only](https://www.gravityforms.com/community/read-only/).

_​ **Disclaimer**: Third-party se_ rvices, _plugins, or code snippets that are referenced by our Support documentation or in Support Team communications are provided as suggestions only. We do not evaluate, test or officially support third-party solutions. You are wholly responsible for determining if any suggestion given is sufficient to meet the functional, security, legal, ongoing cost and support needs of your project._

_Feedback, feature and integration requests, and other functionality ideas can be submitted on our [Gravity Forms](https://roadmap.forms.gravity.com/tabs/1-under-consideration/submit-idea), [Gravity Flow](https://roadmap.flow.gravity.com/tabs/1-under-consideration/submit-idea), or [Gravity SMTP](https://roadmap.smtp.gravity.com/tabs/15-under-consideration/submit-idea) product roadmap pages._
