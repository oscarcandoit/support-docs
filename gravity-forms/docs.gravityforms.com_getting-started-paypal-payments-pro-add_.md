PayPal has announced that from September 2024, certain [legacy APIs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/deprecated-resources/) they provide will stop receiving support and customers using them may experience a loss of functionality. If you are using any of our Gravity Forms legacy PayPal Add-Ons ( [PayPal Payments Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-pro-add-on/), [PayPal Payments Standard Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-standard-add-on/), [PayPal Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-pro-add-on/)), we recommend you evaluate the feasibility of migrating to the PayPal Checkout Add-On to avoid possible disruption of services.

Sometimes getting started with the PayPal Payments Pro Add-On can be a bit daunting. For someone who has never used it, there can be some challenges in knowing where to begin and where to continue on to. In this article, we will outline steps that you will take when setting up the PayPal Payments Pro Add-On for Gravity Forms.

## Requirements

**Important**: PayPal requires PCI compliance when using PayPal Payments Pro. For more information on PCI compliance, you will need to contact your web host.

The following articles outline the requirements for the PayPal Payments Pro Add-On:

## Installation

Before you can use this PayPal Payments Pro Add-On, you’ll need to install it. Installation is the same process as installing Gravity Forms or any other WordPress plugin from a zip file. If you need more information on how to do so, the following article will walk you through the process:

[Installing Gravity Forms Add-Ons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms-add-ons/)
