## Overview

Gravity Forms introduces new capabilities to the WordPress Role system. These capabilities are only manageable through a plugin that utilises the WordPress Role Management system.

Gravity Forms offers the following capabilities that can be controlled through role management.

## Third-Party Role Management Plugins

We recommend using the [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) plugin for role management.

**Note:** When the Members plugin is active, and the administrative role already has at least one Gravity Forms capability enabled, the hidden `gform_full_access` capability is not automatically granted, so you will need to manually enable add-on capabilities to access their settings.

The [User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) plugin can also be used, but does not list the capabilities unless they have already been granted to at least one user or role.
