## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_Date class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Date field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |
| --- |
| `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>``<br>`//get the date type`<br>`$date_type``=``$field``->dateType;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **admin\_label\_setting**

Controls whether the “Admin Field Label” setting appears.
- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**

Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.
- **css\_class\_setting**

Controls whether the “Custom CSS Class” setting displays. This allows a custom css to be used for the field.
- **date\_format\_setting**

Controls whether the “Date Format” setting displays. This provides a list of available formats from which to choose.
- **date\_input\_type\_setting**

Controls whether the “Date Input Type” drop down appears. This allows the calendar selection to be set to a “Date Field”, “Date Picker”, “Date Drop Down”.
- **default\_value\_setting**

Controls whether the “Default Values” section displays. This allows a value to be set for the field.
- **description\_setting**

Controls whether the “Description” setting appears. This allows a description for the field to be displayed.
- **duplicate\_setting**

Controls whether the “No Duplicates” setting displays within the “Rules” section. This controls whether the same value may exist more than once in the database. The “Rules” setting must be active for this to display.
- **error\_message\_setting**

Controls whether the “Custom Validation Message” setting which allows a custom message to be used appears.
- **label\_setting**

Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.
- **placeholder\_setting**

Controls whether the “Placeholders” section appears. This allows placeholder text to display for the field.
- **prepopulate\_field\_setting**

Controls whether the “Allow field to be populated dynamically” setting appears.
- **rules\_setting**

Controls whether the “Rules” settings section displays. The “Required” option shows when this is active.
- **sub\_label\_placement\_setting**

If a field has sub-labels, controls whether the “Sub-Label Placement” setting appears.
- **visibility\_setting**

Controls whether the “Visibility” setting displays. The controls whether the option of visibility being for “Everyone” or “Admin Only” can be set.

- **type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field type, which in this case is **date**.

## $entry Value

The Date field value is not stored in the format configured on the field. The submitted value is reformatted during form submission by get\_value\_save\_entry() so all Date fields are stored in the [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object) in a consistent format, Y-m-d (i.e. 2016-05-21).

## Useful Methods

GF\_Field\_Date inherits it’s available methods from [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) and overrides a few of them where necessary to provide its required appearance and functionality. Here are a few methods which can be useful when writing custom code.

### checkdate()

The checkdate() method is used when validating the date field value by looking at the month, day, and year and verifying each piece is not empty, is numeric, and that the year is 4 digits.

**Usage Example**

|     |
| --- |
| `$is_valid``=``$field``->``checkdate``(``$month``,``$day``,``$year``);` |

- **$month** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

Two digit Month.
- **$day** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

Two digit Day.
- **$year** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

Four digit Year.
- **Returns** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates if the supplied values are valid.

### get\_value\_entry\_detail()

The get\_value\_entry\_detail() method formats the entry value before it is used in notifications, confirmations, and the entry detail page. It can also be used in custom code to reformat the [$entry value](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_date/#entry-value) back to the date format specified when the field was configured.

**Usage Examples**

|     |
| --- |
| `// if you have access to the $field object`<br>`$value``=``$field``->get_value_entry_detail(``$value``);`<br>``<br>`// if you don't have access to the $field object but you do have the $form get the field first`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``,``$field_id``);`<br>`$value``=``$field``->get_value_entry_detail(``$value``);` |

- **$value** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The serialized string to be formatted.
- **$currency** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Not relevant to this field type. Default is an empty string.
- **$use\_text** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Not relevant to this field type. Default is false.
- **$format** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Not relevant to this field type. Default is html.
- **$media** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Not relevant to this field type. Default is screen.
