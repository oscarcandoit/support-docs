## Introduction

The Gravity Forms PayPal Checkout Add-On, when connected to the [PayPal Checkout](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/commerce-platform), allows you to quickly and easily accept payments from 286 million PayPal customers, in over 100 currencies and across 200 markets, with advanced Fraud Protection and unprecedented control.

This add-on was previously named **PayPal Commerce Platform** at version 1.0. Note that the [filters](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/hooks/filters/filters-addons/paypal-checkout-filters/) do still use the \_ppcp\_ naming convention, and have not been changed to avoid any issues with existing hook users.

## Prerequisites

- Your PayPal account country and account type must be listed as supported for **_onboarding before payment_** in the following [PayPal’s documentation page](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/multiparty/seller-onboarding/#link-Country%20Eligibility). If PayPal doesn’t support **_onboarding before payment_** for your account, you can’t use this add-on.
- You will need Gravity Forms version 2.4 or greater and the Gravity Forms PayPal Checkout Add-On [installed and activated](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on).
- Because of the secure nature of capturing payment information, you will be required to install an SSL certificate on your web site if you have not already done so. You will also need to configure your WordPress site to work properly with SSL.



Contact your web host if you need assistance purchasing and configuring an SSL certificate. And configure your site WordPress Address and Site Address to use the https prefix once your certificate is ready.

## Setup PayPal Checkout

Learn how to setup the PayPal Checkout Add-on in our [Setting Up The PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-paypal-checkout-add-on) article.

## Setup Your Form

Refer to the [Setting Up A PayPal Checkout Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-paypal-checkout-compatible-form) article for detailed instructions on how to setup your form to be compatible with the PayPal Checkout Add-on.

## Configuring a Feed

See the [Configuring A Feed For The PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-a-feed-for-the-paypal-checkout-add-on) article.

## Viewing Sales Results

After creating a feed and making your first sale, you can view the results on the Sales Results page.  Review [Viewing Sales Results](https://docs.gravityforms.com/viewing-sales-results/) article for more information.

## Transaction Types Supported

The PayPal Checkout Add-on supports one-time payments (aka the Products and Services transaction type) and [recurring payments (Subscriptions Transaction Type)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configure-paypal-checkout-subscriptions/). You can also configure an [Authorize and Capture transaction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configure-authorize-and-capture-in-paypal-checkout/).

## Funding Sources

When using PayPal Checkout, you may be able to offer additional payment types beyond PayPal and credit card, in the form of payment buttons that show up when a user interacts with the form. For example, Venmo.

The payment buttons offered are dependent upon PayPal’s presentation algorithm, which basis its choices on factors related to the seller and the buyer. For example, Venmo may not be offered to buyers outside the US.

For complete information on this option, refer to [this guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/additional-paypal-checkout-payment-buttons/).

## PayPal Checkout Add-On Hooks

The PayPal Checkout Add-On provides hooks that can be used to modify the default functionality or extend it. For more information, review the [PayPal Checkout Add-On Hooks](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/hooks/filters/filters-addons/paypal-checkout-filters/).

## Add-On Framework Hooks

Because the PayPal Checkout Add-On is built using the Add-On Framework it also inherits any hooks available in the framework methods it uses such as:

[gform\_{$SHORT\_SLUG}\_field\_value](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_slug_field_value/) for changing a field value before it is passed to the PayPal Checkout.
