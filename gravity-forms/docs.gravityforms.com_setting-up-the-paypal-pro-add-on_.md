# Setting Up the PayPal Pro Add-On

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-paypal-pro-add-on/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-paypal-pro-add-on/#h-setup)

**DEPRECATION NOTICE**: The PayPal Pro Add-On is no longer being updated by Gravity Forms, and is no longer available for download. It uses a legacy PayPal API no longer being actively developed by PayPal, and is not compatible with modern PayPal accounts. It has been replaced in our plug-in library by [other PayPal add-ons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/).

## Pre-Requisites

- SSL certificate installed and configured
- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the add-on
- A PayPal Pro account
- [A form with a Pricing field and a Credit Card field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-pro-add-on/#setup-your-form)

The Gravity Forms PayPal Pro Add-On requires the use of the Pricing Fields in Gravity Forms v1.6.3+ and will not work with older versions of Gravity Forms.

Because of the secure nature of capturing credit card information, you will also be required to purchase and install an SSL certificate on your web site. You will also need to configure your WordPress site to work properly with SSL.

Contact your web host if you need assistance purchasing and configuring an SSL certificate.

If you need assistance configuring your WordPress site to work with SSL, we recommend the WordPress HTTPS (SSL) Plugin which you can find here: [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/)

## Setup

1. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
3. From this page, click the **PayPal Pro** tab.
4. Select the API for PayPal Pro integration. Live uses the live PayPal Pro API for real transactions, and Sandbox uses PayPal’s developer sandbox account for test transactions. **Please Note:** Using PayPal’s Sandbox API requires a PayPal developer account which you can sign up for here: [https://developer.paypal.com/.](https://developer.paypal.com/)
5. Enter the **API Username**, **API Password**, and **API Signature** for your PayPal Pro account.
6. Verify IPN has been enabled in your PayPal Pro account in order to enable Recurring Payments.
7. Click **Update Settings**. If you’ve entered your account information correctly, you will be notified by green check marks beside each box. If you do not see green check marks, please double check this information and try again.

Once you have entered your API information, you’re ready to begin [creating a feed for the PayPal Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-paypal-pro-add-on/).
