## Overview

The **[Chained Selects Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/chained-selects/)** provides multi-level, dependent fields called cascading selects. Each selected choice is filtered by the value chosen in the preceding level, allowing you to capture structured data without exposing users to irrelevant options.

## What it does

The [Chained Selects Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/chained-selects/) shows a series of dropdowns, e.g., **Make → Model → Year**, where each dropdown only lists options that fit the choice made in the one before it.

You define the relationships in a CSV file, and the add-on uses that format to display the correct choices at each step.

## When to use it

**When a dataset is hierarchical or relational,** it would otherwise require many static fields and conditional logic rules.

**When you must prevent invalid combinations** and standardize form submissions for downstream processing, reporting, or integrations.

**When the option space is ample** and it should be progressively narrowed to keep forms performant and usable.

## How it works

1. **Prepare data** in a spreadsheet with one column per level, left-to-right in the intended selection order.
2. **Ensure headers** exist for each column (e.g., Make, Model, Year).
3. **Export as CSV** and upload it to a **Chained Selects** field in the form editor.

## Typical examples

- **Locations:** Country → State/Province → City
- **Products / Support:** Category → Sub-category → Product → Version
- **Automotive:** Make → Model → TYear
- **Education:** Faculty → Program → Course → Module

## Data notes

- Use a clean, headered CSV (UTF-8). The column order defines the selection order.
- Keep values consistent (casing/whitespace) to avoid duplicates or “orphaned” branches.
- Large datasets are supported via CSV, and developers can also populate choices dynamically using the **[Chained Selects Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/hooks/filters/filters-addons/chained-selects-filters/)** filters.

### CSV Format

This CSV defines a three-level chained select. Selecting **2015** filters the **Make** field to Acura, Alfa Romeo, or Aston Martin. Choosing **Acura** then limits the **Model** field to ILX, MDX, RDX, RLX, or TLX. Each column represents a select field in the form.
