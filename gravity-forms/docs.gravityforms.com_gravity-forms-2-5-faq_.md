## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Gravity Forms 2.5 publicly released yet?

Yes! After multiple beta releases and a few Release Candidates, Gravity Forms 2.5 was released on 27th April, 2021. This release is staggered meaning the auto-update notices will roll out to our customers over a few weeks.

### What if I want it right now, can I download it?

You can download it on-demand by logging into a Gravity Forms account and going to the [Downloads area](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/downloads/) of your dashboard. You need to have an active license to download Gravity Forms.

### Does the new Form Editor use Gutenberg? What if I have disabled the block editor?

The Gravity Forms editor does **not** use Gutenberg, but given WordPress’s commitment to the Gutenberg block editor aesthetic and usability, we have provided a similar user experience that feels native to the WordPress environment. Your use (or disabling of) the WordPress block editor has no effect on your Gravity Forms form editing environment.

### Does the form editor have column support?

Yes! This much-requested feature is now available. It currently supports up to 4 columns using drag-and-drop within the form editor. [See this article on Working with Columns in the new Form Editor for more details](https://docs.gravityforms.com/working-with-columns/).

### Are there accessibility improvements?

Accessibility was a major focus of 2.5 product development and trying to make the frontend forms as accessible as possible. We have made a lot of changes to the admin, but we can’t claim it’s fully accessible – yet! See [these Kbase articles](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/knowledge-base/accessibility/) for more information on making compatible forms. This will continue to be an area of focus in future Gravity Forms releases as well, in keeping with our [commitment to accessibility](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-commitment-to-accessibility/).

### Are existing website forms backwards compatible?

Yes. Existing forms will default to using the same markup they’ve always used (called **legacy markup**). This means you don’t need to worry about existing forms when you install Gravity Forms 2.5.

Newly created forms will use the new markup but can be updated to use the legacy markup if required.

### Will my existing custom theme or page builder work with Gravity Forms 2.5?

Our beta and RC phases were extended for over a year to give third party developers a chance to test and make updates to their products so they can work seamlessly with the new Gravity Forms. This was for the benefit of not just the [huge library](https://www.gravityforms.com/community) of third party add-ons that work with Gravity Forms, but also theme developers and third party page builders like Elementor, Beaver Builder, WPBakery, Oxygen or Divi. Many of these impose their styles and layout handlers on top of our markup, so when our layout or markup changes, they may need updating.

While many of our most popular third party plugins have been updated, we cannot provide any guarantee that all have done so for all scenarios. If you run into what looks like a new conflict using a theme or page builder (that you do not have when using the generic WP theme for example) after you upgrade, then reach out to the publisher of that plugin and ask them if they are working on compatibility updates. Our talented Support Team can help you diagnose the issue (for example, running a conflict test), but you will still need to get back to the publisher for any necessary tweaks.

### Is there a change-log/feature list/bug list available?

There are a few different places you can get further information about Gravity Forms 2.5.

- [search](https://docs.gravityforms.com/?s=Gravity+Forms+2.5) this very document site!
- check out the **many** informative articles we published on Gravity Forms 2.5 during the beta period on the [Gravity Forms blog](https://www.gravityforms.com/blog/).
- as always, keep an eye on the [official Gravity Forms change log](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravityforms-change-log/).
- see [this document](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-2-5-deprecated-items/) listing items that were deprecated in 2.5.
