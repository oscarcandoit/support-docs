# Centering an Entire Form

- [Placement](https://docs.gravityforms.com/centering-an-entire-form/#h-placement)

Here’s a quick CSS snippet used to center an entire form.

Replace 2 in #gform\_wrapper\_2 with the id of your form.

|     |
| --- |
| `/* keep it mobile friendly by only applying these styles for larger viewports */`<br>`@media only``screen``and (``min-width``:``641px``) {`<br>``<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``{`<br>```max-width``:``50%``;`<br>```margin``:``0``auto``;`<br>```}`<br>``<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``.gfield .ginput_container,`<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``.gfield .gfield_description,`<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``div.ginput_complex label,`<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``input:not([type=``'radio'``]):not([type=``'checkbox'``]):not([type=``'submit'``]),`<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``select,`<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``textarea {`<br>```text-align``:``center``;`<br>```}`<br>``<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``.top_label .gfield .gfield_label {`<br>```text-align``:``center``;`<br>```display``:``block``;`<br>```}`<br>``<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``.gform_footer,`<br>```body #gform_wrapper_``2``.gform_page_footer{`<br>```text-align``:``center``;`<br>```}`<br>``<br>`}` |

## Placement

You can add your Custom CSS to the Customizer (Appearance → Customize) or your child theme stylesheet.
