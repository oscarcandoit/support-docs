# reCAPTCHA Scores and Statuses

- [Overview](https://docs.gravityforms.com/recaptcha-scores-and-statuses/#h-overview)
- [Scores](https://docs.gravityforms.com/recaptcha-scores-and-statuses/#h-scores)
- [Statuses](https://docs.gravityforms.com/recaptcha-scores-and-statuses/#h-statuses)
- [Score and Status Reference](https://docs.gravityforms.com/recaptcha-scores-and-statuses/#h-score-and-status-reference)

## Overview

When the **reCAPTCHA Add-On** is active, entries may display either a **score** or a **status** value in the Entries List and Entry Detail pages. This article explains what those values mean.

## Scores

For forms using **reCAPTCHA v3**, a score between **0 and 1** may be displayed. A lower score indicates a higher likelihood that the request is from a bot. For details on how to interpret these scores, see [Google’s documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3#interpreting_the_score).

## Statuses

In some cases, a status is shown instead of a score. These statuses indicate configuration or service conditions.

## Score and Status Reference

| **Status/Score** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| A score between **0 and 1** | reCATPCHA v3 score indicating likelihood of good/bot interaction (1.0 is very likely a good interaction, 0.0 is very likely a bot) |
| **disabled** | reCAPTCHA is disabled in the form settings. |
| **disconnected** | No valid v3 site and secret keys are saved, or the add-on does not have an Enterprise authentication token. |
| **disconnected (reauthentication required)** | The request to refresh the Enterprise authentication token failed. Your Google Workspace session requires periodic reauthentication. Please reconnect the add-on, and contact your Google Workspace administrator if you need help with this policy. |
| **disabled (quota limit)** | The reCAPTCHA API quota limit has been reached. |
| **disabled (token refresh in progress)** | Another settings page view or form submission is currently refreshing the Enterprise authentication token. |
| **disabled (token refresh failed)** | The request to refresh the Enterprise authentication token failed. It will be retried during the next form submission or when viewing the settings page. |
