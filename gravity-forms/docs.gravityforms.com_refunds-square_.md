# Issuing Refunds with the Square Add-On

- [Initiating a Refund](https://docs.gravityforms.com/refunds-square/#h-initiating-a-refund)
- [Refund Payment Notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/refunds-square/#h-refund-payment-notifications)

**Note:** this tutorial explains how to issue a refund for **Products** and **Services** using the Square Add-On. To issue a refund for a Subscription, you must access your **[Square Dashboard](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6116-process-refunds)** and follow their subscription management and refund procedures.

## Initiating a Refund

You can initiate a refund from within your form entries for the Square Add-On. Any entry that has collected payment and has a status of Paid will display a **Refund Payment** option in the **Payment Details** section of the entry detail.

Clicking the **Refund Payment** button will refund the payment (via your Square account), and the screen will be updated with details about the pending refund.

## Refund Payment Notifications

If you have the Square Add-On installed, you can send an email notification when a Payment isRefunded. See the Notification Events documentation [here](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-notification-events/#h-payment-refunded).
