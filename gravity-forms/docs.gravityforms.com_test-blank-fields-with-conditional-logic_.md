# Testing For Blank Fields With Conditional Logic

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/test-blank-fields-with-conditional-logic/#h-introduction)
- [Choice Based Fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/test-blank-fields-with-conditional-logic/#h-choice-based-fields)
- [Non-Choice Based Fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/test-blank-fields-with-conditional-logic/#h-non-choice-based-fields)

## Introduction

You can base conditional logic on whether or not a field value is empty. The method you use depends on the type of field you are basing the conditional logic on.

## Choice Based Fields

This method applies to Dropdown, Radio Button, Checkbox, and Multi-Select fields.

1. Choose the field to base the conditional logic on in the first drop down
2. Choose the qualifier “ _is_” in the second drop down
3. If you are using a [Placeholder](https://docs.gravityforms.com/common-field-settings/#h-placeholder), select that placeholder in the last drop down. The placeholder will be the first option shown in the drop down
4. If you are not using a Placeholder, select the first option which is “Empty (no choices selected)” in the last drop down

**Example** (not using a placeholder):

**Example**(using a placeholder):

![Screenshot showing conditional logic configuration for when the placeholder text is the only thing 'selected'](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/hide-if-placeholder-1-1024x591.png)_Screenshot showing conditional logic configuration for when the placeholder text is the only thing ‘selected’_

## Non-Choice Based Fields

This method applies to any field where you can enter text or numbers freely without having to select from pre-existing choices.

1. Choose the field to base the conditional logic on in the first drop down
2. Choose the qualifier “ _is_” in the second drop down
3. Leave the value field **blank** in the last input

**Example:**
