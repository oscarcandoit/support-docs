## Description

Filters through and allows modification of the forms displayed in the Form Switcher dropdown.

## Parameters

- **$forms** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array containing the last ten forms sorted by most recently edited by the logged-in user.

## Examples

### Exclude a single form from search results

This example shows how to prevent form ID 10 from appearing in the Form Switcher search results.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8 | `add_filter(``'gform_form_switcher_forms'``,``'exclude_ten'``);`<br>`function``exclude_ten(``$forms``) {`<br>```$forms``=``array_filter``(``$forms``,``static``function``(``$element``) {`<br>```return``$element``->id !==``"10"``;`<br>```});`<br>```return``$forms``;`<br>`}` |

### Include all active forms on page load

This example shows how you can include all active forms in the Form Switcher on page load.

**Note:** this can impact admin performance for sites with lots of forms and even result in critical/fatal PHP memory errors.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12 | `add_filter(``'gform_form_switcher_forms'``,``function``(``$forms``) {`<br>```if``( wp_doing_ajax() ) {`<br>```return``$forms``;`<br>```}`<br>```$is_active``= true;`<br>```$sort_column``=``'title'``;``// or 'id', 'date_created', or 'date_updated'.`<br>```$sort_direction``=``'ASC'``;``// or 'DESC'.`<br>```$is_trash``= false;`<br>```return``GFFormsModel::get_forms(``$is_active``,``$sort_column``,``$sort_direction``,``$is_trash``);`<br>`} );` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.
