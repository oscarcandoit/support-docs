# Confirmations

A "confirmation" is the response shown immediately after a successful form submission. They can display a specific message on your page ("Thank you for your inquiry. We respond within 24 hours."), or redirect the the submitter to another page or URL. Typical uses include showing a tailored success message, routing sales leads to product specific pages, or pre-populating a follow-up form via query strings.

Multiple confirmations can be created, and you can then use conditional logic to choose the preferred post-submission action based on criteria you have set.  Confirmations also support merge tags for personalization.

For a quick start guide to confirmations, check out our Getting Started section titled [Confirmations and Notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmations-and-notifications/).
