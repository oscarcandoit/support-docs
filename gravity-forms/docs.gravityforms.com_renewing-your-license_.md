## How do I renew my license?

With the exception of some [legacy licenses](https://docs.gravityforms.com/legacy-license-faq/), Gravity Forms licenses will automatically renew within the subscription they are contained in, unless you have canceled. There is no way to renew a subscription manually.

You can review your license renewal date and payment method by [logging in](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-in/) to your [Gravity account](https://www.gravityforms.com/login).

**Note**: A [canceled license](https://docs.gravityforms.com/cancel-auto-renewals/) is not eligible for renewal, even if you have not yet passed the license expiry date.

## When will my subscription renew?

To find the _next payment date_ for your subscription, [log in](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/) to your [Gravity account](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-profile/) page, and look for the subscription you would like to know about. The renewal date is listed with each subscription on the **Licenses & Downloads** page, as well as within the **Manage Subscription** area.

## Renewal Notifications

We will notify you via email a few days prior to your renewal. Additionally, we will email you if your on-file payment method is about to expire. Finally, we will email you if your renewal payment fails to process, as that is an indication **your license may be about to be canceled**.

**Note**: For this reason, it is very important to keep your account email address current and valid and to ensure that our emails are not being classified as spam by any rules or filters you have set up. See this article for [instructions on updating your email address](https://docs.gravityforms.com/changing-your-email-address/).
