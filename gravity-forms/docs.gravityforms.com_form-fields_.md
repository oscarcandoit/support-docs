## Introduction

The Form Editor toolbox groups fields into four categories: Standard, Advanced, Post and Pricing. This post provides a quick reference to all the standard field types available in Gravity Forms.

**Note**: Some fields may require a specific Gravity Forms Add-On to be installed in order to function, and that may require a certain [Gravity Forms license type](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/). Those fields are marked with an “AO” superscript below.

Deleting a field will also delete all entry data associated with that form field.

## Standard Fields

Standard Fields are basic form fields that can be customized for just about any use. These can be used to capture and store a variety of data when an advanced field is not available to meet your needs.

| Field | Field Type |
| --- | --- |
| [**Single Line Text**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/single-line-text/) | Standard |
| **[Paragraph Text](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paragraph-text/)** | Standard |
| **[Drop Down](https://docs.gravityforms.com/drop-down/)** | Standard |
| [**Number**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/number/) | Standard |
| [**Checkboxes**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/checkboxes/) | Standard |
| [**Radio Buttons**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/radio-buttons/) | Standard |
| [**Hidden**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/hidden/) | Standard |
| [**HTML**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/html/) | Standard |
| [**Section Break**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/section-break/) | Standard |
| [**Page Break**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/page-break/) | Standard |
| [**Multiple Choice**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/multiple-choice-field/) | Standard |
| [**Image Choice**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/image-choice-field/) | Standard |

## Advanced Fields

Advanced Fields are more advanced form field types with specific usage in mind. Advanced fields may actually contain multiple fields in one container. These fields make it easy to capture data such as a users Name, Address, etc.

## Post Fields

Post Fields are form fields that enable you to capture data that is then used to create a WordPress Post. These fields make it quick and easy for you to create forms that allow users to submit content to your site. The result posts will be set as a Draft and will need to be published before they are visible.

| Field | Field Type |
| --- | --- |
| **[Post Title](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_insert_post/)** | Post |
| **[Post Body](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_insert_post/)** | Post |
| **[Post Excerpt](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_excerpt/)** | Post |
| **[Post Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_set_post_tags/)** | Post |
| **[Post Category](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_set_post_categories/)** | Post |
| **[Post Image](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/set_post_thumbnail/)** | Post |
| **[Post Custom Field](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/update_post_meta/)** | Post |
