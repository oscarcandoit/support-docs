## Summary

A feed allows form submission data to be sent to another source. In this instance, you will need to create a feed to pass data from your form data through to your Salesforce objects. In addition to mapping fields, you can specify what the Salesforce Add-On should do when Salesforce identifies the passed data as a duplicate of something that already exists.

## Create a Feed

To create a feed to Salesforce using the Salesforce Add-On for Gravity Forms, do the following from your WordPress Admin Dashboard:

1. Click on **Forms** in the left side menu.
2. Select the form that you want to use with Salesforce.
3. Once within your desired form, hover over **Settings** and click on **Salesforce**.
4. Click **Add New** to create a new feed. All the options you are presented with are described in the next section.

## Feed Settings Reference

![Image showing feed settings reference.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-05-22-a-las-12.40.20%E2%80%AFp.-m-1024x489.png)

Multiple feeds can be created for different Object Types. Each feed will be mapped to an Object Type. By creating multiple feeds and mapping them to the appropriate Object Types, you can update, e.g., a Business Address and Business Contacts using the same form.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | To identify your feed when viewing the feed list page. **Required** |
| **Object Type** | The Object Type from your Salesforce account to which you want to send data. Object Types are created and managed in the Salesforce platform. Adjust these in Salesforce to align with your data management needs. **Required** |
| **Feed Conditional Logic** | If unchecked, every successful form submission will be sent to Salesforce. If you wish to set specific conditions for sending form data to Salesfoce, check this and fill out the required criteria. |

## Field Mapping

Mapping is the way you identify which data field in your Salesforce is to be the destination for each of your form fields.

Each Salesforce object will have its own selection of data fields. The fields for the chosen object will be loaded from the object when an object type is selected in the Feed Information section above, allowing you to identify each of them for mapping.

![Image showing the feed mapping for the Address Object Type](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-06-12-a-las-10.58.09%E2%80%AFa.-m-1024x735.png)_Image showing the feed mapping for the Address Object Type_

## Duplicate Records

![Image showing duplicate records option set to disabled.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-05-21-a-las-1.26.24%E2%80%AFp.-m-1024x140.png)

This setting determines how the add-on feed will handle entries that Salesforce identifies as duplicates.

- When enabled, the feed will update existing records in Salesforce that are recognized as duplicates. This ensures that your Salesforce data remains up-to-date without creating redundant entries.

![Image showing an Entry Note with a success note about the object being updated.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-05-23-a-las-1.25.51%E2%80%AFp.-m-1024x199.png)

- When disabled, the feed will not update duplicate records. Instead, if a duplicate is found, an error will be displayed in the entry log, and that form entry will not be processed.

![Image showing an Entry Note with a failure note about the object not being updated.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-05-22-a-las-12.51.49%E2%80%AFp.-m-1024x341.png)

The criteria and rules for identifying duplicates are provided and managed from within your Salesforce account settings. Adjust these rules in Salesforce to align with your data management needs.

## Known Limitations

- The “Custom Values” option in field mapping is not supported. This does not affect mapping to custom objects or custom fields in Salesforce.

- Mapping file upload fields to Salesforce is not supported.

- Email
