## Summary

The release of [WordPress 5.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/) ushered in the block editor, and Gravity Forms embraced a completely new editor environment to provide a Gravity Forms Block within the page/post editor. This article shows the steps required to add a form to your page using the Gravity Forms block.

## How To Add The Gravity Forms Block

You can add a form to a page or post by using the block function that is a part of Gravity Forms core. This article assumes that you have already created a form. See [Create A New Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/create-a-new-form) for instructions.

1. Open the page or post that you wish to add a form to.
2. Click the **plus sign** to add a new block.
3. In the **Search for a block** field, type **gravity** or **form**.
4. Under **Embeds**, click on **Form**. This will insert the Gravity Forms block.
5. Click the **Select a Form** drop down and choose your form. This will insert the selected form.
