# Setting Up the Salesforce Add-On

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-salesforce-add-on/#h-pre-requisites)
- [First time connection](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-salesforce-add-on/#h-first-time-connection)
- [Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-salesforce-add-on/#h-setup)

## Pre-Requisites

- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the add-on
- A [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account with access to the Salesforce API.

**Note on API Access:** To utilize the Gravity Forms Salesforce Add-On, your Salesforce account must have access to the Salesforce API. For more information on this, refer to [this Salesforce developer article](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_rest_compatible_editions.htm) that outlines the license types known to provide API access. Salesforce offers many promotional and trial editions that may or may not have API access. Use our [Salesforce Connection Verification Tool](https://www.gravityforms.com/salesforce-connection-verification-tool/) to confirm your Salesforce account supports the required APIs for our Gravity Forms integration.

## First time connection

Salesforce has added [additional security requirements for new connections](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005132365&type=1) from connected apps, which are necessary for the Salesforce Add-On to function. Only administrations in an Organization or users with an explicitly assigned permission can install an app for the first time. Once it has been installed by completing an OAuth connection, anyone in the Organization should be able to use it.

If it is the first time connecting to Salesforce through the add-on, make sure that either:

- An admin does the first OAuth connection, OR
- The user installing the app has both API Access and the “Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps” permission.

If the first connection is performed by a user with either of these conditions, the connection should work correctly. After the initial connection, you should be able to switch to a non-administrator account.

## Setup

1. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
3. Click the **Salesforce** tab.
4. Click the **Connect to Salesforce** button.

Once you have successfully authenticated your account, you will see the message **Signed into Salesforce**.

[![Image showing Salesforce connection status.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-05-23-a-las-2.14.56%E2%80%AFp.-m-1024x265.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captura-de-pantalla-2024-05-23-a-las-2.14.56%E2%80%AFp.-m.png)

You can then set up a Salesforce feed using the instructions shown in [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-salesforce-add-on/).

**Note:** The Gravity Forms Salesforce Add-On does not support connecting to Sandbox environments.
