## Introduction

Scripts and styles can be included for an add-on by overriding the scripts() and styles() functions with structured arrays. All scripts and styles will be added automatically to the Gravity Forms no-conflict mode whitelist.

## Scripts

The scripts() function must return an associative array with the following properties:

- **handle** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The script will be registered with WordPress using this handle.

- **src** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The URL of the script.

- **version** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The version number to be added to the query parameters for cache busting. Set to null to disable.

- **deps** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array of handles for scripts which are required before this script is loaded.

- **in\_footer** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the scripts will be enqueued in the footer.

- **callback** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

Function that is called when the script is enqueued.

- **strings** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array of strings that can be accessed in JavaScript through the global variable _\[script handle\]\_strings_.

- **enqueue** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array of conditions for loading the script. See [Enqueue Conditions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/include-scripts-styles-with-addon-framework/#enqueue-conditions).


**Important**: When overriding this function, be sure to call parent::scripts() to ensure the base class scripts are enqueued.

### Scripts Example

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25 | `public``function``scripts() {`<br>```$scripts``=``array``(`<br>```array``(`<br>```'handle'``=>``'my_script_js'``,`<br>```'src'``=>``$this``->get_base_url() .``'/js/my_script.js'``,`<br>```'version'``=>``$this``->_version,`<br>```'deps'``=>``array``(``'jquery'``),`<br>```'in_footer'``=> false,`<br>```'callback'``=>``array``(``$this``,``'localize_scripts'``),`<br>```'strings'``=>``array``(`<br>```'first'``=> __(``'First Choice'``,``'simpleaddon'``),`<br>```'second'``=> __(``'Second Choice'``,``'simpleaddon'``),`<br>```'third'``=> __(``'Third Choice'``,``'simpleaddon'``)`<br>```),`<br>```'enqueue'``=>``array``(`<br>```array``(`<br>```'admin_page'``=>``array``(``'form_settings'``),`<br>```'tab'``=>``'simpleaddon'`<br>```)`<br>```)`<br>```)`<br>```);`<br>```return``array_merge``( parent::scripts(),``$scripts``);`<br>`}` |

## Styles

The styles() function must return an associative array with the following properties:

- **handle** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The CSS file will be registered with WordPress using this handle.

- **src** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The URL of the CSS file.

- **version** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The version number to be added to the query parameters for cache busting. Set to null to disable.

- **deps** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array of handles for scripts which are required before this script is loaded.

- **media** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The media for which this stylesheet has been defined.

- **enqueue** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array of conditions for loading the css file. See [Enqueue Conditions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/include-scripts-styles-with-addon-framework/#enqueue-conditions).


**Important**: When overriding this function, be sure to call parent::styles() to ensure the base class scripts are enqueued.

### Styles Example

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `public``function``styles() {`<br>```$styles``=``array``(`<br>```array``(`<br>```'handle'``=>``'my_styles_css'``,`<br>```'src'``=>``$this``->get_base_url() .``'/css/my_styles.css'``,`<br>```'version'``=>``$this``->_version,`<br>```'enqueue'``=>``array``(`<br>```array``(``'field_types'``=>``array``(``'poll'``) )`<br>```)`<br>```)`<br>```);`<br>```return``array_merge``( parent::styles(),``$styles``);`<br>`}` |

## Enqueue Conditions

Scripts and styles should always be loaded only when needed. The [Add-On Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework) provides a simple way to configure this for each JavaScript and CSS file. When overriding scripts() and styles(), be sure to include the “enqueue” array with any or all of the following properties:

- **callback** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

Function that is called to determine if the script or stylesheet can be enqueued.

**Example:**

|     |
| --- |
| `array``(``$this``,``'requires_script'``)` |

- **admin\_page** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

Specify one or more pages (known pages) where the script is supposed to be enqueued. When this setting is specified, scripts will only be enqueued in those pages. _Possible values: form\_editor, form\_settings, plugin\_settings, plugin\_page, entry\_view, entry\_detail, results, block\_editor_.

**Example:**

|     |
| --- |
| `array``(``'admin_page'``=>``array``(``'form_settings'``,``'plugin_settings'``) )` |

- **tab** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

Specifies a form settings or plugin settings tab in which the script is supposed to be enqueued. If none is specified, the script will be enqueued in all of the form settings or plugin\_settings pages.

**Example:**

|     |
| --- |
| `array``(``'tab'``=>``'signature'``)` |

- **query** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Specifies a set of query string ($\_GET) values. If all specified query string values match the currently requested page, the script will be enqueued. Note that \_empty\_ and \_notempty\_ can be used as “smart” values.

**Example:**

|     |
| --- |
| `array``(``'query'``=>``'page=gf_edit_forms&view=settings&id=_notempty_'``)` |

- **post** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Specifies a set of post ($\_POST) values. If all specified posted values match the current request, the script will be enqueued.

**Example:**

|     |
| --- |
| `array``(``'post'``=>``'posted_field=val'``)` |

- **field\_types** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

Specifies one or more field types that require this script. The script will only be enqueued if the current form has a field of any of the specified field types. Only applies when a current form is available.

**Example:**

|     |
| --- |
| `array``(``'field_types'``=>``array``(``'signature'``) )` |
