# Authorized Gravity Forms Sellers

- [Only Purchase from Authorized Methods](https://docs.gravityforms.com/authorized-gravity-forms-sellers/#h-only-purchase-from-authorized-methods)
- [Why You Should Not Purchase From An Unofficial Channel](https://docs.gravityforms.com/authorized-gravity-forms-sellers/#h-why-you-should-not-purchase-from-an-unofficial-channel)

## Only Purchase from Authorized Methods

If you’re wondering if the deal you’ve located is a valid one for Gravity Forms, or if you’ve found a site that is offering a discounted version of Gravity Forms that isn’t sold directly on our site, it’s likely not the real deal. These are the only authorized methods for purchasing Gravity Forms:

- Licenses that are [sold on our site](https://gravityforms.com/pricing/), which will always link to the _gravityforms.com_ to initiate purchase.
- Starter licenses are bundled as a special offer with **[Gravity Flow](https://gravityflow.io/account/gravity-forms-starter-licenses/)**.
- Licenses sold through an [official Gravity Forms affiliate](https://www.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-affiliate-program/), which will **always** link to _gravityforms.com_ for the purchase process.

For more information on Gravity Flow Starter Licenses, visit [Gravity Flow](https://gravityflow.io/account/gravity-forms-starter-licenses/).

Any other deals you find are **not legitimate**, but are someone repackaging our code. Often such sites will include something like this in their footer:

> DISCLAIMER: All items listed in the Nobuna directory are developed by third-party developers and redistributed by Nobuna under the terms of the General Public License (GPL). Nobuna is not associated with nor is endorsed by the developers of any products featured on this website.

## Why You Should Not Purchase From An Unofficial Channel

- You will not be eligible for Support from us.
- Unauthorized sites may not provide updates. You may end up missing out on security and feature updates.
- Unauthorized sites may not provide refunds. We [certainly do](https://docs.gravityforms.com/obtaining-a-refund-for-your-license/?_ga=2.43350693.125619981.1614011964-2068956694.1609772594) when you buy through our official channels.
- Unauthorized sites can bundle their own code in the package, making your website vulnerable to data extraction or other hacking.
- Because those shysters ripped off our carefully designed products with malicious intent, and the desire to profit without putting in any of the hard work, customer compassion, or careful thought that we pride ourselves on. They may dress it up with “open source” language, or try to fool you into thinking they are somehow partnered with us (burying their caveats in tiny fine print and fancy language), but they are most definitely **not** the hard-working folks of Gravity Forms, and any money they receive does not get re-invested into the product.
