## Description

This filter allows custom logic to be used to determine if a payment add-on which extends [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) should process the submission for the given amount.

## Short Slug Values

The [Gravity Forms Add-On Slugs](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-add-on-slugs) article lists the available short slugs to use with this hook.

## Usage

The base filter which would run for all forms and all fields would be used like so:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_stripe_is_valid_payment_amount'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 5 );` |

To target a specific form append the form id to the hook name. (format: gform\_{$SHORT\_SLUG}\_field\_value\_FORMID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_stripe_is_valid_payment_amount_10'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 5 );` |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **$is\_valid** | [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool) | Indicates if the amount is valid for processing. Default is `true` when the amount is greater than zero. |
| **$submission\_data** | [Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/submission-data/) | Contains the form title, payment amount, setup fee amount, trial amount, line items created using the submitted pricing field values, and any discounts from coupons. |
| **$feed** | [Feed Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/feed-object) | The feed to be processed. |
| **$form** | [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object) | The form currently being processed. |
| **$entry** | [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object) | The temporary entry containing the submitted values. |

## Examples

### 1\. PayPal custom minimum amount

This example shows how you can prevent the add-on proccessing submissions where the amount is less than $1.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `add_filter(``'gform_stripe_is_valid_payment_amount'``,``function``(``$is_valid``,``$submission_data``) {`<br>```return``floatval``(``$submission_data``[``'payment_amount'``] ) > 1;`<br>`}, 10, 2 );` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.

See also the PHP section in this article: [Where Do I Put This Code?](https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-do-i-put-this-code/)

## Since

This filter was added in Gravity Forms 2.4.18.

## Source Code

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2 | `$tag_args``=``array``( sprintf(``'gform_%s_is_valid_payment_amount'``,``$this``->get_short_slug() ),``$form_id``);`<br>`$is_valid``= (bool) gf_apply_filters(``$tag_args``,``$is_valid``,``$submission_data``,``$feed``,``$form``,``$entry``);` |

This filter is located in GFPaymentAddOn::is\_valid\_payment\_amount() in _includes/addon/class-gf-payment-addon.php_.
