**Note**:❗Refund requests received via email, social media, and forms other than our Support form will be disregarded. Please follow the process described here for the quickest refund processing.

The following is a summary only. For the full and current conditions of refunds, please review our official [refund policy](https://www.gravityforms.com/refund-policy/) terms.

## Which transactions are refundable?

We will refund **any** transaction you have made for a Gravity Forms subscription purchased through _gravityforms.com_ if your transaction date was **within the last 30 days**, no questions asked. This includes an original purchase or an upgrade transaction.

## Can I get a refund if I have upgraded my license?

Yes. The same conditions as stated above still apply.

If you have both purchased _and_ upgraded within thirty days, we will refund both transactions automatically. If your upgrade is within the last 30 days, only that transaction will be refunded.

Note that you **cannot** _downgrade_ an already upgraded license. So if you request a refund of an upgrade transaction, your license will still be immediately canceled (not downgraded to the previous license type) and any transaction older than 30 days for that license will not be refunded.

## How do I submit a refund request?

### Without access to a Gravity Forms Account

Simply [go to our refund page](https://www.gravityforms.com/refunds) and follow the instructions there.

### From your Gravity Forms Account

1. Log in to your [Gravity account](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-profile/) page. Go to **Licenses** and click **Manage Subscription**.
2. **If your subscription qualifies** for a refund, the Request Refund button will be presented below the license details on the left side of the screen.

3. Click on **Request Refund** button to open a modal. Select a reason, then click **Confirm Cancellation** **and** **Refund Request**.

4. Back on the Manage screen, there is now an alert in blue.

## What happens when I submit a refund request?

Your license and subscription will be canceled immediately at the time you submit your refund request. We will process the request within a few days, and you will receive a notification of completion. Note that your financial institution may take extra days to display your refund in your banking or credit card account.

↪️ 💳 **Refunds can only be issued to the original payment method used at the time of purchase.** We are unable to process refunds to a different credit card, issue a bank check, or return funds to an alternative payment method.
