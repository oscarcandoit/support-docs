## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_FileUpload class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the File Upload field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |
| --- |
| `// Get the field.`<br>`$field``= GFAPI::get_field(``$form_or_id``,``$field_id``);`<br>`// Get the allowed extensions.`<br>`$extensions``=``$field``->allowedExtensions;` |

### Settings

| S **etting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **admin\_label\_setting** | Controls whether the **Admin Field Label** setting appears. |
| **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting** | Controls whether the **Enable Conditional Logic** setting appears. |
| **css\_class\_setting** | Controls whether the **Custom CSS Class** setting displays, allowing a custom CSS class to be applied to the field. |
| **description\_setting** | Controls whether the **Description** setting appears, allowing a description for the field to be displayed. |
| **error\_message\_setting** | Controls whether the **Custom Validation Message** setting appears, allowing a custom validation message to be defined. |
| **file\_extensions\_setting** | Determines whether the **Allowed file extensions** section displays, where a comma-delimited list of permitted file extensions may be entered. |
| **file\_size\_setting** | Determines whether the **Maximum File Size** section displays, setting the allowed size for each uploaded file. |
| **label\_setting** | Controls whether the **Field Label** setting appears, allowing the label to be changed. |
| **multiple\_files\_setting** | Determines whether the **Enable Multi-File Upload** section displays, allowing multiple files to be uploaded and setting a file limit. |
| **rules\_setting** | Controls whether the **Rules** section displays, enabling the **Required** option. |
| **visibility\_setting** | Controls whether the **Visibility** setting displays, allowing the option to restrict visibility to **Everyone** or **Admin Only**. |

### Properties

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **adminLabel** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The label to be used on admin pages instead of the label, useful for fields with long labels. |
| **adminOnly** | [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean/) | Determines whether the field is visible to the user submitting the form, or only visible in the admin. |
| **allowedExtensions** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | A comma-delimited list of the file extensions which may be uploaded. |
| **conditionalLogic** | [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array/) | An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object/) for more details. |
| **cssClass** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The custom CSS class or classes to be added to the input tag for the field. |
| **description** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The field description. |
| **descriptionPlacement** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The placement of the field description. The description may be placed **above** or **below** the field inputs. If the placement is not specified, the Form Layout setting is used. |
| **errorMessage** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The custom error message to be displayed if the field fails validation. |
| **formId** | [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer/) | The form ID. |
| **id** | [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer/) | The field ID. |
| **isRequired** | [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean/) | Marking the field as required will prevent the form from being submitted if the user does not enter a value. Default is false. |
| **label** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages. |
| **maxFiles** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | When multiple file uploads are enabled, this property sets a limit on how many files may be uploaded. |
| **maxFileSize** | [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer/) | The maximum size an uploaded file may be. |
| **multipleFiles** | [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean/) | Indicates whether multiple files may be uploaded and changes the interface accordingly. |
| **type** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The field type, which in this case is **fileupload**. |

## Dynamic Population

Since Gravity Forms 2.9.18, the File Upload field supports dynamic population with a file URL, a comma-separated or JSON encoded list of file URLs, or an array of file URLs.

**Note:** Only the URL(s) are saved to the entry. The files are **not** copied to the uploads folder.

## Calculations Support

The File Upload field can’t currently be used with calculations.

## Conditional Logic Support

Conditional logic rules can’t currently be based on the File Upload field.

## Draft Entry Value

Since version 2.8.6, the field value found in the draft entry, returned by `GFFormsModel::create_lead()` and `GFFormsModel::get_current_lead()`, contains a JSON encoded array of details about the temporary file(s). Example:

|     |
| --- |
| `[{``"tmp_path"``:``"\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/gravity_forms\/6-13631115a0dd7370720e7c2979c2f768\/tmp\/65febb4be9e37_input_3.png"``,``"tmp_url"``:``"https:\/\/domain.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/gravity_forms\/6-13631115a0dd7370720e7c2979c2f768\/tmp\/65febb4be9e37_input_3.png"``,``"tmp_name"``:``"65febb4be9e37_input_3.png"``,``"uploaded_name"``:``"screenshot.png"``}]` |

This is the same for both the single file field and the multi-file enabled field. The array for each file contains the following:

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **tmp\_path** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The server path of the file located in the form’s tmp directory. |
| **tmp\_url** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The URL of the file located in the form’s tmp directory. |
| **tmp\_name** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The temporary name assigned to the file. |
| **uploaded\_name** | [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/) | The name of the file uploaded by the form submitter. |

To access these file properties, you’ll need to JSON decode the field entry value. Example:

|     |
| --- |
| `$field_value``= rgar(``$draft_entry``,``$field_id``);`<br>`if``(``empty``(``$field_value``) ) {`<br>```return``;`<br>`}`<br>`$files``= json_decode(``$field_value``, true );`<br>`if``(``empty``(``$files``) ) {`<br>```return``;`<br>`}` |

This will provide you with an indexed array, which can be accessed like so:

|     |
| --- |
| `foreach``(``$files``as``$file``) {`<br>```// Do something with the file.`<br>```$tmp_path``= rgar(``$file``,``'tmp_path'``);`<br>```$tmp_url``= rgar(``$file``,``'tmp_url'``);`<br>```$tmp_name``= rgar(``$file``,``'tmp_name'``);`<br>```$uploaded_name``= rgar(``$file``,``'uploaded_name'``);`<br>`}` |

They can also be accessed using the file index instead of a `foreach`. The following example is accessing the first file, which is located at index `0`.

|     |
| --- |
| `$tmp_path``= rgars(``$files``,``'0/tmp_path'``);`<br>`$tmp_url``= rgars(``$files``,``'0/tmp_url'``);`<br>`$tmp_name``= rgars(``$files``,``'0/tmp_name'``);`<br>`$uploaded_name``= rgars(``$files``,``'0/uploaded_name'``);` |

If you will be using the URL of the temporary file publicly, you might want to hide the real location of the file by using the field’s `get_download_url()` method to return a URL using a `gf-download` query string instead, e.g.

|     |
| --- |
| `$field``= GFAPI::get_field(``$form_or_id``,``$field_id``);`<br>`$file_url``=``$field``->get_download_url(``$tmp_url``,``$force_download``= false );` |

## Saved Entry Value

The saved entry value depends on how the field is configured. For the default single file configuration, the value is the URL of the uploaded file. For the multi-file configuration, the value is a JSON encoded array of file URLs.

We recommend using the following approach to access the URL(s).

|     |
| --- |
| `$field_value``= rgar(``$entry``,``$field_id``);`<br>`if``(``empty``(``$field_value``) ) {`<br>```return``;`<br>`}`<br>`$urls``= json_decode(``$field_value``, true );`<br>`if``(``empty``(``$urls``) ) {`<br>```$urls``=``array``(``$field_value``);`<br>`}`<br>`foreach``(``$urls``as``$url``) {`<br>```// Do something with the $url.`<br>`}` |
