# Timeout Confirmation

- [Overview](https://docs.gravityforms.com/timeout-confirmation/#h-overview)
- [How Timeout Confirmation Works](https://docs.gravityforms.com/timeout-confirmation/#h-how-timeout-confirmation-works)
- [Default Timeout Confirmation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/timeout-confirmation/#h-default-timeout-confirmation)
- [Using Payment Status in Confirmations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/timeout-confirmation/#h-using-payment-status-in-confirmations)

## Overview

The **Timeout Confirmation** is automatically added when using the [Stripe Card Element](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-field/#h-stripe-card-element) and alerts customers if their payment is delayed.

Timeouts happen when Gravity Forms does not receive a response from Stripe within 20 seconds. This doesn’t mean the payment failed, but indicates that the Stripe webhook response is delayed. The **Timeout Confirmation** clarifies to users that Stripe continues processing the payment in the background.

**Note**: The **Timeout Confirmation** is only available for the [Stripe Card Element](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-field/#h-stripe-card-element) payment method and when Stripe’s Payment Element is **not** enabled.

## How Timeout Confirmation Works

The confirmation flow follows three possible outcomes when a form with a Stripe feed is submitted.

| **Outcome** | **What Happens** | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Successful Payment** | Stripe responds with a success. | The default confirmation is displayed, or a custom confirmation can be shown using conditional logic with the **Active** or **Paid** payment status. |
| **Failed Payment** | Stripe responds with a failed payment. | A **form validation error** is displayed. The user can correct their payment method and resubmit. |
| **Timeout (No Response in 20 Seconds)** | Stripe does not respond within 20 seconds. | The **Timeout Confirmation** is displayed, notifying the customer that their payment is still processing and may complete once Stripe’s delayed webhook response is received. |

## Default Timeout Confirmation

When you add a Stripe feed to a form using the **Stripe Card Element, a Timeout Confirmation is created automatically**. The default Confirmation includes a generic message. You can edit this [Confirmation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmation-type-page/) just like any other Confirmation in Gravity Forms.

## Using Payment Status in Confirmations

Starting with Gravity Forms 2.9.1, confirmation conditional logic supports **Payment Status**. With Stripe 6.0, this feature is enabled for forms with Stripe feeds.

Available payment statuses for conditional logic:

- **Active**
- **Paid**
- **Processing**

[![Image showing Conditional Logic based con Payment Status for Confirmations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-5-1024x340.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-5.png)

This allows you to display different confirmation messages depending on the payment outcome. For details on setting up conditional confirmations, see [Enable Conditional Logic for Confirmations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enable-conditional-logic-for-confirmations/).
