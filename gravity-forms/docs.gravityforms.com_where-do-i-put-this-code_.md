## Introduction

Depending on what code you are trying to add, and the complexity of the theme you are using, there can be a number of different places that code snippets can be added to extend your forms. This article covers most of the common options.

## Important!

Replacing or updating your theme can overwrite the theme directory in your site folder, which means modifications like these you may have made to files there will be lost. Always keep regular back-ups, consider using [a child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/), and check out some of the [third party plugins](https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-do-i-put-this-code/#h-third-party-plug-ins) that provide safer alternatives for adding code.

## CSS

CSS code will typically look something like this:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `body .gform_wrapper {``border``:``1px``solid``red``}` |

Please see [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-to-put-your-custom-css/) for placement options.

## JavaScript/jQuery

Refer to [this](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-javascript-code-to-the-admin-side-of-your-site/) article for placement options when adding JavaScript to the admin side of your site and [this](https://docs.gravityforms.com/?p=42418) article for adding JavaScript to the front end.

## PHP

PHP code will typically look something like this:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11 | `<?php`<br>`function``gform_add_post_format(``$entry``) {`<br>```$post_id``= rgar(``$entry``,``'post_id'``);`<br>```if``( !``$post_id``)`<br>```return``;`<br>```wp_set_object_terms(``$post_id``,``'chat'``,``'post_format'``);`<br>`}` |

### Theme’s functions.php file

PHP snippets will almost always be pasted in your theme’s _functions.php_ file, after any other existing code, or after the opening **<?php** tag.

There are a few things to be aware of when adding PHP snippets:

1. Your _functions.php_ will already have an opening **<?php** tag. If the snippet you are copying also has an opening PHP tag, be sure to remove it before pasting it into your _functions.php_ file.
2. If the PHP snippet you are copying has an opening and closing PHP tag inside the code itself, do not remove these. This simply means that the code is exiting “PHP mode” to output content directly to the screen.
3. If you update your theme, you will need to add the snippet again. To avoid this situation, please use a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/).

## Third Party Plugins

Some enterprising WordPress developers have released third-party plugins to provide safer methods for adding code. Check out the [WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) to see what is available.

Here is one that has seen large install numbers: [Code Snippets Third Party Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)

[Pluginception](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pluginception/) is another option to consider. It allows you to easily create custom functionality plugins from your WordPress dashboard.

_​ **Disclaimer**: Third-party se_ rvices, _plugins, or code snippets that are referenced by our Support documentation or in Support Team communications are provided as suggestions only. We do not evaluate, test or officially support third-party solutions. You are wholly responsible for determining if any suggestion given is sufficient to meet the functional, security, legal, ongoing cost and support needs of your project._

_Feedback, feature and integration requests, and other functionality ideas can be submitted on our [Gravity Forms](https://roadmap.forms.gravity.com/tabs/1-under-consideration/submit-idea), [Gravity Flow](https://roadmap.flow.gravity.com/tabs/1-under-consideration/submit-idea), or [Gravity SMTP](https://roadmap.smtp.gravity.com/tabs/15-under-consideration/submit-idea) product roadmap pages._
