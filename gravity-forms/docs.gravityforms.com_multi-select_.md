Multi Select field as displayed in the [Form Editor](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-editor/#h-the-layout-space).

**Important:** If your choice labels contain any HTML or special characters such as ampersands, commas, hyphens or brackets of any type, you **MUST** enable the show values feature and give each choice a simple and unique value which does not contain any special characters. Failure to configure values could cause issues for features such as calculations, conditional logic, dynamic population, and validation.
