# reCAPTCHA Add-On Changelog

## 2.1.0 \| 2025-11-13

- Added a new [`gform_recaptcha_spam_score_threshold`](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_recaptcha_spam_score_threshold/) filter to control score threshold used to identify spam.
- Updated the connection error message on the settings page (shown when auth token refresh fails) to indicate when the connected Google Workspace account has a policy requiring periodic reauthentication.
- Updated to skip validation if the form or honeypot is already invalid, or it's not the first or last page, reducing the Google credit usage by some forms.
- Updated Enterprise API auth token refresh to log the response for an edge case where a 200 status is returned but a new auth token is not issued.
- Fixed an issue where the entry detail page metabox is not added when the score is 0.
- Fixed an issue where an entry note is not added when the entry is marked as spam.

## 2.0.0 \| 2025-08-20

- Added support for notifying Google (annotating the assessment) when an entry that has a reCAPTCHA score is marked as spam or not spam via the entries list or detail pages. Note: only applies to the Enterprise connection type and entries created after this version is installed.
- Fixed a JavaScript error on the Forms > Settings > reCAPTCHA page when no-conflict mode is enabled.
- Fixed an issue where the Forms > Settings > reCAPTCHA page reloads with the connection type settings displayed when attempting to connect using the Enterprise connection type.
- Fixed a PHP fatal error that can occur in some hosting environments when determining if the badge is disabled on script enqueue if $\_POST is null.
- Fixed an issue where the status displayed instead of the score on the entries list and entry detail pages is not translatable.
- Fixed an issue where new submissions not processed because of an Enterprise API auth token refresh issue save a status of disconnected to the entry meta.
- Fixed an issue where the score changes to 0 or a status (e.g. disconnected) when an existing entry is updated.
- Fixed handling of an unexpected response during the Enterprise API auth token refresh.
- Fixed an issue where an incorrect logging statement can be written to the Gravity Forms core log when using the Enterprise connection type.
- Fixed an unhandled WP\_Error during the Enterprise API auth token refresh that caused the add-on to become disconnected.

## 1.9.0 \| 2025-07-21

- Fixed an issue where reCAPTCHA Enterprise can fail if reCAPTCHA returns a response of 1 instead of 1.0.

## 1.8.0 \| 2025-07-08

- Added a new [`gform_recaptcha_enterprise_keys_page_size`](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_recaptcha_enterprise_keys_page_size/) filter to control the number of keys returned per API call.
- Fixed an issue where when connected with the Enterprise connection method, the settings page only retrieves 10 reCAPTCHA keys.
- Fixed an issue where the reCAPTCHA badge is visible on pages that don't include a form when the "Disable Google reCAPTCHA Badge" setting is enabled.
- Fixed an issue where multiple Enterprise API auth token refresh requests can occur when the site has multiple concurrent visitors, causing the add-on to become disconnected.
- Fixed an issue where the Enterprise API can be initialised multiple times during the same request.

## 1.7.0 \| 2025-06-04

- Added support for using reCAPTCHA Enterprise keys and the reCAPTCHA Enterprise API.
- Updated the connection screen to improve clarity and differentiate connection options.
- Fixed an issue where form submission fails if the reCAPTCHA quota limit has been reached.

## 1.6.0 \| 2024-07-30

- Added support for the upcoming gform/submission/pre\_submission filter that will be released with Gravity Forms 2.9.

## 1.5.0 \| 2024-04-30

- Fixed an issue where duplicate entries are created when using Conversational Forms with reCAPTCHA v3.
- Fixed an issue where form submission hangs after Stripe 3DS validation.
- Fixed an issue where all REST API submissions are marked as spam.
- Note: If used alongside the Stripe Add-On, this version of the reCAPTCHA Add-On requires version 5.5.0 or later of the Stripe Add-On.

## 1.4.0 \| 2024-01-17

- Fixed an issue where reCaptcha v3 validation is not triggered when using the Stripe Payment Element.
- Fixed the PHP 8.2 creation of dynamic property deprecation notice that occurs on form submission.

## 1.3.0 \| 2023-11-09

- Fixed an issue where a JavaScript error can occur on the front-end if the page also includes custom or third-party forms.
- Fixed an issue where the v3 settings aren't populated by the GF\_RECAPTCHA\_V3\_SITE\_KEY and GF\_RECAPTCHA\_V3\_SECRET\_KEY constants.

## 1.2.0 \| 2023-08-31

- Updated the reCAPTCHA settings link for the Captcha field "To use the reCAPTCHA field" message in the form editor.
- Fixed an issue where reCAPTCHA fails validation when using the Stripe Payment Element.
- Fixed an issue that causes the scripts for the frontend to not be available in production mode when compiled by Webpack.
- Fixed an issue where scripts are sometimes missing dependencies, and sometimes getting loaded unnecessarily.

## 1.1 \| 2021-07-21

- Fixed an issue where an undefined variable notice appears on the add-on settings page.
- Fixed an issue where forms can fail validation if they include dynamically added fields such as the honeypot.
- Fixed an issue where the reCAPTCHA response is saved and output by merge tags.
- Fixed an issue where submissions from the User Registration Add-On login form are blocked.

## 1.0 \| 2021-06-23
