## Introduction

![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversationalforms-tab-300x77.png)

The official Gravity Forms Conversational Forms Add-On allows you to present forms in a user-friendly way. Fields are presented one at a time to set a conversational tone and keep the visitor’s focus on the current question or field. The full-page container is beautifully-themed and customizable, and each conversational form can be accessed via a unique, customizable permalink.

## Prerequisites

- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the add-on.
- [Gravity Forms 2.7.11](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravityforms-change-log/) or later is required.

## Configure Conversational Form Settings

All conversational form settings are set at the form level. These can be accessed at **Form Settings →** **Conversational Forms** for your form. Refer to the article [Setting Up the Conversational Forms Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-conversational-forms-add-on/) for a description of all the available settings.

## Incompatibilities

Due to the special nature of conversational form presentation, some fields and form settings are incompatible with the conversational form layout, as described below.

- The [Repeater field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/repeater-fields/) is not supported in Conversational Forms.
- Invisible CAPTCHAs that must be placed as a field on your form (e.g. Google reCAPTCHA v2 invisible badge or an invisible [Turnstile field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-the-cloudflare-turnstile-add-on/)) are not supported in Conversational Forms. Additionally, the [CAPTCHA](https://docs.gravityforms.com/captcha/) field is not supported.
- Form Title and Form Description can be set in [form settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-settings/), but they do not display.
- Conversational Forms always use a “Label placement” value of “Top.” Any other label placement value will be ignored.
- The following [form settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-settings/) have no effect on Conversational forms: “Animated transitions”; “Enable legacy markup”.
- Conversational Forms do not support [CSS ready classes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/list-of-css-ready-classes/).
- Moving to a new field on a conversational form will not trigger a Google Analytics pagination event.
- Clicking the continue button does not save or update a partial entry like the next and previous buttons do on a regular multi-page form.
- It is not possible to [chain forms using shortcodes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-chain-forms-using-shortcodes/) in the confirmation message when Form 1 is a Conversational Form.
- If the `gform_disable_css` filter is enabled, Conversational Forms will not work properly.

## Version Requirements for Payment Fields

A conversational form can be used as a payment collecting form, but note that you may need the _most recent version of the payment add-on_ to ensure payment field compatibility. Specifically:

- Credit Card Field is supported.
- 2Checkout Field: Will be supported in a future update.
- Mollie Field: will be supported in the upcoming Mollie version 1.4.

- Name


This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
