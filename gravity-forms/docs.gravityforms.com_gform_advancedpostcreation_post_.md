| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_advancedpostcreation_post'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 4 );` |

To target a specific form, append the form id to the hook name. (format: gform\_advancedpostcreation\_post\_FORMID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_advancedpostcreation_post_1'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 4 );` |

## Examples

### Change the post content

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_advancedpostcreation_post'``,``'change_post'``, 10, 4 );`<br>`function``change_post(``$post``,``$feed``,``$entry``,``$form``){`<br>```$post``[``'post_content'``] =``'This is a test'``;`<br>```return``$post``;`<br>`}` |

### Change the post slug

This example uses merge tags to change the post slug which is taken from the post\_name property. This time we have limited the scope of the snippet to form id 1 by adding the form id to the filter name.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_advancedpostcreation_post_1'``,``function``(``$post``,``$feed``,``$entry``,``$form``) {`<br>```$slug``=``'{first name:1.3} {last name:1.6} {date:2:year}-{date:2:month}'``;`<br>```$post``[``'post_name'``] = sanitize_title( GFCommon::replace_variables(``$slug``,``$form``,``$entry``, false, false, false,``'text'``) );`<br>```return``$post``;`<br>`}, 10, 4 );` |

### Change the post excerpt

This examples uses a specific paragraph field to be written to the post excerpt. Be sure to change your code to match the field id which you are using for inputting the excerpt.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_advancedpostcreation_post'``,``'change_post_excerpt'``, 10, 4 );`<br>`function``change_post_excerpt(``$post``,``$feed``,``$entry``,``$form``){`<br>```$post``[``'post_excerpt'``] = rgar(``$entry``, 6 );``// Field 6 is the Excerpt`<br>```return``$post``;`<br>`}` |

## Placement

This code should be placed in the [functions.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Functions_File) file of your active theme.

## Since

This filter was added in the Gravity Forms Advanced Post Creation add-on version 1.0.

## Source Code

This filter is located in GF\_Advanced\_Post\_Creation::create\_post() in _class-gf-advancedpostcreation.php_.
