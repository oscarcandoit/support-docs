# Akismet Anti-Spam

- [Updates to the Akismet Integration](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-anti-spam/#h-updates-to-the-akismet-integration)
- [More Information](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-anti-spam/#h-more-information)

## Updates to the Akismet Integration

Since version 1.6, Gravity Forms has included built-in support for the Akismet Anti-Spam plugin by Automattic. When the Akismet plugin is active, Gravity Forms will automatically use it for spam detection, even if the [Gravity Forms Akismet Add-On](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/akismet/) is not installed.

**Note:** This built-in integration is planned for removal in Gravity Forms 3.0 (or a point release shortly after), and will be fully phased out in a future version. The [Gravity](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/akismet/) [Forms Akismet Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-the-akismet-add-on/) will be required to continue using Akismet with Gravity Forms.

The [Gravity Forms Akismet Add-On](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/akismet/) provides enhanced functionality, including form-level settings for more precise control over spam filtering. Submissions flagged as spam by Akismet will be marked with an entry status of [spam](https://docs.gravityforms.com/spam/), which prevents them from triggering notifications or add-ons.

## More Information

Refer to [the Akismet Add-On user guides](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/akismet-add-on/) for articles about setting up and using the [Gravity Forms Akismet Add-On](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/akismet/).
