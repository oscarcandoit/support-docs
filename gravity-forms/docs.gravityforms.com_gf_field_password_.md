# GF\_Field\_Password

- [Settings and Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_password/#h-settings-and-properties)
- [Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_password/#h-settings)

- [Source Code](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_password/#h-source-code)

## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_Password class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Password field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission. The Password field is not available in Gravity Forms by default. The [Gravity Forms User Registration Add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/user-registration/) is one of the plugins which will add this field to the list of available fields.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the password strength`<br>`$password_strength_enabled``=``$field``->passwordStrengthEnabled;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **admin\_label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Admin Field Label” setting appears.

- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.

- **css\_class\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom CSS Class” setting displays. This allows a custom css to be used for the field.

- **description\_setting**


Controls whether the “Description” setting appears. This allows a description for the field to be displayed.

- **error\_message\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom Validation Message” setting which allows a custom message to be used appears.

- **input\_placeholders\_setting**


For complex fields like the password, name, time, and address fields, this controls whether the “Placeholders” section will appear which lets you set placeholder text for the individual components of the field. When it is not a complex field, the “placeholder\_setting” controls the display of this section.

- **label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.

- **password\_strength\_setting**


Controls whether the “Enable Password Strength” section displays. This allows the minimum password strength to be set to **Short**, **Bad**, **Good**, or **Strong**.

- **rules\_setting**


Controls whether the “Rules” settings section displays. The “Required” option shows when this is active.

- **sub\_labels\_setting**


If a field has sub-labels, controls whether the setting to set them appears.

- **sub\_label\_placement\_setting**


If a field has sub-labels, controls whether the “Sub-Label Placement” setting appears.


### Properties

Below is a listing of the properties inherited from the parent class and ones specific to the field.

- **adminLabel** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The label to be used on admin pages instead of the label, useful for fields with long labels.

- **conditionalLogic** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object) for more details.

- **cssClass** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom CSS class or classes to be added to the input tag for the field.

- **description** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field description.

- **descriptionPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The placement of the field description. The description may be placed “above” or “below” the field inputs. If the placement is not specified, then the description placement setting for the Form Layout is used.

- **errorMessage** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom error message to be displayed if the field fails validation.

- **formId** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The form ID.

- **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The field ID.

- **inputs** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array containing the the individual properties for each element of the password field.


  - **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)
    The id of the input field.

  - **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    The label for the input.

  - **customLabel** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    The custom label for the input. When set, this is used in place of the label.

  - **placeholder** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    Placeholder text to give the user a hint on how to fill out the field. This is not submitted with the form.


An example of the array output is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `$inputs``=``array``(`<br>```array``(`<br>```'id'``=>``'1'``,`<br>```'label'``=>``'Enter Password'``,`<br>```'customLabel'``=>``'Password'``,`<br>```'placeholder'``=>``'Please enter your password'`<br>```),`<br>```array``(`<br>```'id'``=>``'1.2'``,`<br>```'label'``=>``'Confirm Password'``,`<br>```'customLabel'``=>``'Confirmation'``,`<br>```'placeholder'``=>``'Please confirm your password'`<br>```),`<br>```)` |

- **isRequired** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Marking the field as required will prevent the form from being submitted if the user does not enter a value. Default is false.

- **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages.

- **labelPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The placement of the main field label “Address”. The choices are top-aligned (top\_label), left-aligned (left\_label), right-aligned (right\_label). To control the sub-label placement of the fields within the address group, use the “subLabelPlacement” property.

- **minPasswordStrength** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Indicates how strong the password should be. The possible values are **short**, **bad**, **good**, **strong**.

- **passwordStrengthEnabled** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates whether the field displays the password strength indicator.

- **subLabelPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The placement of the labels for the fields (street, city, zip/postal code, etc.) within the address group. This setting controls all of the address pieces, they cannot be set individually. They may be aligned above or below the inputs. If this property is not set, the “Sub-Label Placement” setting on the Form Settings->Form Layout page is used. If no setting is specified, the default is above inputs.

- **type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field type, which in this case is **password**.
