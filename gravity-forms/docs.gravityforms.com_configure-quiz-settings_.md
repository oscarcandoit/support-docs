## Introduction

When you add a Quiz Field to your form, a new section will automatically be added to the **[Form Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/access-your-form-settings/)** that introduces Quiz specific settings that will affect **all** Quiz fields on your form.

## How to access the Form specific Quiz Settings

From within your form, hover over **Settings** and click on **Quiz**. This will take you to a panel of Quiz related settings.

If you do not see the Quiz settings panel, double check that you have the Quiz Add-On properly installed **and** that you have at least one quiz field on the form in question.

[![Form Level Quiz Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.38.52.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.38.52.png)

## Quiz Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Shuffle quiz fields** | Randomize the order of the quiz fields on this form each time the form is loaded. |
| **Instant Feedback** | Display correct or incorrect indicator (✔︎ or ❌) and explanation (if any) immediately after answer selection. Once an answer has been selected it can’t be changed unless the form is reloaded. <br>This setting **only** applies to _radio button quiz fields_ and it is intended for training applications and trivial quizzes. It should not be considered a secure option for critical testing requirements. |

## Grading Settings

By default **Grading** is set to **None**, but if you would like to add the calculation of an overall grade to your quiz, you can select either **Pass/Fail** or **Letter** grading options.

Choosing a grading type will open up an additional set of options.

### Pass/Fail Grading Options

[![Quiz Pass/Fail Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.39.18.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.39.18.png)

| Grading Options | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Pass Percentage** | Identify the percentage score the user must equal or exceed to be considered to have “passed.” |
| **Display Quiz Confirmation** | Present the user to either a pass or fail confirmation message upon submission of the quiz form. You can specify the exact text of either message in the applicable boxes using the rich text editor. |
| **Disable Auto-formatting** | WordPress will sometimes automatically add paragraph spacing to your text to help readability. If you’ve carefully crafted your layout (e.g. using HTML), select the **Disable Auto Formatting** checkbox to disable that function. |
|  |  |

### Letter Grading Options

[![Quiz Grade Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.39.45.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-13.39.45.png)

This option lets you assign a letter grade based on the percentage score achieved. Click the + sign to add more letter grades, and set the letter identifier and the minimum percentage for each.

**Display quiz confirmation** and **Disable Auto-formatting** are described in the table above.
