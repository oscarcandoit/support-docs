## Pre-Requisites

- Gravity Forms and Gravity Forms Mollie Add-On installed
- SSL Certificate Installed and Configured
- [A Mollie Account](https://mollie.com/)

## Getting to the Mollie Settings

The Mollie Settings will allow you to connect and authenticate to your Mollie account. It will allow you to connect to either your **Live** or **Test** Mollie environment.

Navigate to your Mollie Add-On Settings page:

1. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
3. Click on the **Mollie** tab.


## Mode

Specify the environment you want to send your form submissions to. Choosing **Live** will send transactions to your live/production Mollie account and may initiate real charges. **Test** will pass the form entry into your Mollie Test environment, which will not generate any real transactions.

1. Under **Mollie Account**, select the Mode to use for Mollie integration: **Live** or **Test**.
2. Continue in the sections below labeled [**Connecting to Live**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-mollie-add-on/#connecting-to-live) or [**Connecting to Test**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-mollie-add-on/#connecting-to-test).

[![Configuring the Mode in the Mollie Settings screen](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-10.36.21-2.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-10.36.21-2.png)

### Connecting to Live

1. Select the Mode **Live** and Click the **Connect with Mollie** button.
2. Your web browser will pass you to a new screen showing “Redirecting you to **Mollie…**”

![Redirecting to Mollie from the Mollie Add-on, Mollie Settings Screen](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mollie-settings-redirect-to-mollie.png)

3. Login with your Mollie Account and **Sign In**.![Authenticate to Mollie to Login to your Account](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mollie-settings-authenticate-to-mollie.png)

4. You will be directed to a **Mollie Permissions screen** with the message “Gravity Forms requests access to your Mollie Organization:” and a list of the permissions that are necessary for the feed to be properly configured. If you have multiple organizations under this account, you can select the correct organization from the drop-down list provided.

![Permissions screen for Mollie Add-on displaying permissions necessary for Gravity Forms to connect to your Mollie Account.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mollie-settings-grant-permissions-510x1024.png)

5. Click **Allow Access** to accept the listed permissions for Gravity Forms access to your Mollie account. This will connect your Mollie account to Gravity Forms.
6. You will be returned to the Mollie Settings tab. You should see “ **Connected to Mollie as”** with your Organization name.
7. A new section will also be added for **Website Profile** and a drop-down allowing you to select your Profile from your Mollie Account. Your default Business Location in Mollie will be selected, but if you have more than one in your account, you can select the correct one from this list.
8. Click **Update Settings** to finish configuring your Mollie Settings.

Once you have entered your Mollie settings, you’re ready to begin [Setting up a Mollie Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-mollie-compatible-form/).

### Connecting to Test

You can switch back and forth between **Live** and **Test** at the Mollie Settings screen once you’ve made the initial connection to your account.

1. **To Switch to Test**, select **Test** under **Mode** and Click **Update Settings**.
2. **To Switch to Live**, select **Live** under **Mode** and Click **Update Settings**.

Once you have entered your Mollie settings, you’re ready to begin [Setting up a Mollie Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-mollie-compatible-form/).

### Disconnecting your Mollie Account

To disconnect your connected Mollie Account, click the **Disconnect from Mollie** button in _Forms →_ _Settings → Mollie_, then save your changes.

[![Image showing Disconnect from Mollie button](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CleanShot-2025-08-29-at-12.53.17@2x-1024x442.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CleanShot-2025-08-29-at-12.53.17@2x.png)

## Notes

When connecting and testing transactions in Test Mode, the customer data is always shown as “Test Consumer/consumer@example.com” in the Mollie Dashboard, under Payment Details, regardless of the billing information mapped.

### Locale Compatibility with Mollie

If you’re encountering issues with localization when using Mollie, check your site’s locale settings since Mollie supports a [limited set of locale codes](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/common-data-types#locale) when processing payment requests. If your WordPress site is using a locale not supported by Mollie, it may cause issues with localized payment screens or customer facing elements.
