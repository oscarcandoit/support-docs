# Creating a Feed for the Stripe Add-On

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-stripe-feeds/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-stripe-feeds/#h-introduction)
- [Create Your Feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-stripe-feeds/#h-create-your-feed)
- [Testing](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-stripe-feeds/#h-testing)

The Stripe feed settings were modified in Stripe Add-On version 3.0. For setting up older versions, [refer to this article.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-feed-for-the-stripe-add-on-version-2-9-and-earlier)

## Pre-Requisites

- [Setup the Stripe Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-installing-the-stripe-add-on/)
- [Create a Stripe Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-stripe-compatible-form/)

## Introduction

The last step of integrating Stripe with Gravity Forms is creating a feed. A feed communicates information to Stripe each time a visitor successfully submits your form. **This is a critical step. If it is not completed, nothing is sent to Stripe for processing.**

## Create Your Feed

1. Open the form you want to link to Stripe, or create one using this guide: [Setting up a Stripe compatible form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-stripe-compatible-form/).
2. Select **Forms** from your WordPress dashboard to view your forms. Hover hover over **Settings** of the form you would like to add Stripe to, and select **Stripe** from the dropdown.

3. You will be directed to a **Stripe Feeds** page. Select **Add New** or **Create One** to begin creating your Stripe Feed.
4. Give your Feed a unique **Name**. This prevents any trouble with distinguishing the feed later on. It is not displayed to the user. See notes below.
5. Select the **Transaction Type**. **Products and Services** are single one time payments while **Subscription** is a recurring payment.

6. You will then need to complete the various panels of Feed Settings to define how you feed should work. Refer to our [Feed Settings Reference document](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-feed-settings-reference/) for a full description of all settings.

## Testing

There is a large amount of settings required for payment gateways, and their proper functioning is probably key to your forms operation. Verify that your Stripe integration is functioning as expected. We recommend sandbox testing for all form changes **and** before installing add-on updates in your production environment.
