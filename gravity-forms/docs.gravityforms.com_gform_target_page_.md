## Description

The “gform\_target\_page” filter in Gravity Forms sets the target page when submitting the form. Typically applies to multi-page forms.

## Usage

Apply to all forms.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_target_page'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );` |

Target a specific form.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_target_page_123'``,``'my_function'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **$target\_page** | [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer/) | The target page number. |
| **$form** | [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object/) | The current Form object. |
| **$current\_page** | [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer/) | The page from which the form was submitted. |
| **$field\_values** | [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array/) | Dynamic population values that were provided when loading the form. |

## Examples

This example (from the 3rd party [GP Multi-page Navigation](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-multi-page-form-navigation/) plugin) demonstrates how you can account for conditional padding that is added to the target page number when jumping from a source page to a target page with one or more conditional pages between them.
