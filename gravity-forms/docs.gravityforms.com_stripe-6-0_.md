## Summary

The Stripe Add-On 6.0 is the latest feature release for our Stripe integration. It introduces changes to how payment outcomes are handled and improves the payment flow for the **[Stripe Card Element](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-payment-collection-methods/)**. The Stripe Add-On 6.0 also adds a new filter for controlling submission timeouts.

## New Features

**Note**: Stripe 6.0’s changes are only available for the **[Stripe Card Element](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-payment-collection-methods/)** payment method and when the Stripe’s Payment Element is **not** enabled.

### Entry Creation Changes

From Stripe 6.0 onwards, the process for creating and managing entry events with the **[Stripe Card Element](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-payment-collection-methods/)** payment method has been updated to **create an entry when a payment fails.** The payment result is recorded in the Payment Status field of the entry. Starting with Stripe 6.0, an entry will be created for successful and failed payments via the Stripe Card Element.

Refer to the [**Post Payment Actions For Stripe**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/?p=44698&preview=true) article for more information.

### Timeout Confirmation

With Stripe 6.0, a new _Timeout Confirmation_ lets customers know when their payment will take longer.

When a customer submits a payment:

1. **Successful payment**. The default confirmation or one based on **Active** or **Paid** statuses is shown using conditional logic.
2. **Failed payment**. A form validation error appears, allowing the customer to update their payment method and try again.
3. **No response in 20 seconds**. The form submission times out, showing the new Timeout confirmation. This doesn’t mean the payment failed, it indicates a delay in Stripe’s webhook response.

### Payment Status Conditionals for Confirmations

In Gravity Forms 2.9.1, we added **payment status** support to **[confirmation conditional logic](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enable-conditional-logic-for-confirmations/)**, and Stripe 6.0 takes advantage of that feature. This means you will now see _Payment Status_ options for any form linked to a Stripe feed.

Stripe 6.0 supports **Active**, **Paid**, and **Processing** payment statuses forconfirmation conditional logic. This article provides more details about [Payment Status](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-entry-payment-statuses/).

### Send Notifications On Payment Failed

With the updated payment workflow in Stripe 6.0, notifications have also been improved. Previously, there was no way to notify customers when their payment failed because notifications couldn’t be triggere\\d on failure. Now, you can send notifications conditionally based on payment status, allowing you to reach out when a payment doesn’t go through automatically.

Check out [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/holding-notifications-until-after-payment/) for more information on payment notification events.

## New Filters

Stripe 6.0 introduces new filters for enhanced customization and control over form behavior and integration.
