Notice: The Gravity Forms PayPal Commerce Platform Add-On has been renamed **PayPal Checkout** as of version 2.0.

## Prerequisites

See the [Using the PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-the-paypal-checkout-add-on/) article.

## Getting to the PayPal Checkout Add-On Settings

The PayPal Checkout Settings will allow you to connect the add-on to PayPal.

Navigate to the PayPal Checkout Add-On Settings page:

1. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
3. Click on the **PayPal Checkout** tab.

![Pay Pal CheckOut Environment Setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-07-at-18.08.07.png)

## Connecting to PayPal

The PayPal Checkout Add-On supports connecting to the **Live** or **Sandbox** PayPal environments.

We recommend connecting to the **Sandbox** environment using a [developer account](https://developer.paypal.com/) when first configuring the add-on or when modifying existing forms so you can test the forms without interacting with your live PayPal account.

**Note:** PayPal does not permit connecting to a `localhost`. Attempting to do so will generate an error message, _“Hostname localhost not allowed.”_ To test locally, try to use a top-level domain such as `.local.`.

You do not need to have an existing PayPal account to connect the add-on, as PayPal will offer you the opportunity to create a new PayPal account whilst connecting the add-on.

To connect existing PayPal accounts you need to use the primary PayPal account holder login details. Otherwise PayPal will redirect you to your account dashboard instead of continuing the connection process.

Select the environment and then click the **Connect with PayPal** button.

![PayPal Commerce Platform Connect Modal](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CleanShot-2021-06-07-at-18.14.00.png)

In the PayPal modal which is displayed, follow the steps provided by PayPal to connect to an existing PayPal account or create a new PayPal account.

[![PayPal Checkout Connect Modal Done](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ppcp-connect-modal-done-208x300.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ppcp-connect-modal-done.png)

When you have completed connecting the add-on to your PayPal account, click the **Go back to Gravity Forms** button to close the modal. The add-on settings page will reload.

When the add-on is successfully connected, the **Connect with PayPal** button will be replaced with your PayPal merchant ID and the **Disconnect from PayPal** button.

[![PayPal Commerce Platform Merchant ID and Disconnect button](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-07-at-18.39.24.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-07-at-18.39.24.png)

## Account Status

This is only displayed when the add-on is connected to PayPal, it displays the current status of the PayPal account used to connect to the PayPal Checkout.

### Email confirmed

Indicates whether the primary email of the connected PayPal account has been confirmed.

PayPal requires your account email address is confirmed before you can accept payments. See the [How do I confirm my email address?](https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/how-do-i-confirm-my-email-address-faq1485) article on the PayPal Help Center site.

### Payment Receivable

Indicates whether the connected PayPal account can receive payments.

There are many reasons why PayPal can indicate your account can’t receive payments. Please contact PayPal for support with this issue.

### Credit Card field support

Indicates whether the connected PayPal account supports accepting payments using the credit card payment method of the [PayPal Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-field/)

The Custom Card Fields API is in limited release on the PayPal Checkout platform (also known as PayPal Complete Payments). Please check [PayPal’s documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/advanced/eligibility/) for a list of countries where this feature is available.

PayPal also needs to review your account to enable the feature.

Check with PayPal for the most up-to-date information on requirements and available markets.

If this feature is not enabled for your PayPal account, you can still capture payments using PayPal Checkout which is also available with the [PayPal Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-field/).

## Webhooks

Webhooks are notifications that PayPal sends to your website whenever specific events happen, such as processing a subscription, issuing a refund, or approving a payment.

**Note:** In most cases, you won’t need to manually create or configure a Webhook. It is automatically generated during the setup process. If the Webhook is not active, refer to [this guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-webhooks-in-paypal/).
