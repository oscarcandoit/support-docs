## Upgrade guide

Although `supabase_flutter` v2 brings a few breaking changes, for the most part the public API should be the same with a few minor exceptions.
We have brought numerous updates behind the scenes to make the SDK work more intuitively for Flutter and Dart developers.

## Upgrade the client library [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#upgrade-the-client-library)

Make sure you are using v2 of the client library in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```
1

supabase_flutter: ^2.0.0
```

_Optionally_ passing custom configuration to `Supabase.initialize()` is now organized into separate objects:

BeforeAfter

```

await Supabase.initialize(  url: supabaseUrl,  anonKey: supabaseKey,  authFlowType: AuthFlowType.pkce,  storageRetryAttempts: 10,  realtimeClientOptions: const RealtimeClientOptions(    logLevel: RealtimeLogLevel.info,  ),);
```

### Auth updates [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#auth-updates)

#### Renaming Provider to OAuthProvider [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#renaming-provider-to-oauthprovider)

`Provider` enum is renamed to `OAuthProvider`.
Previously the `Provider` symbol often collided with classes in the [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package and developers needed to add import prefixes to avoid collisions.
With the new update, developers can use Supabase and Provider in the same codebase without any import prefixes.

BeforeAfter

```
1
2
3

await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth(  Provider.google,);
```

#### Sign in with Apple method deprecated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#sign-in-with-apple-method-deprecated)

We have removed the [sign\_in\_with\_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) dependency in v2.
This is because not every developer needs to sign in with Apple, and we want to reduce the number of dependencies in the library.

With v2, you can import [sign\_in\_with\_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) as a separate dependency if you need to sign in with Apple.
We have also added `auth.generateRawNonce()` method to easily generate a secure nonce.

BeforeAfter

```
1

await supabase.auth.signInWithApple();
```

#### Initialization does not await for session refresh [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#initialization-does-not-await-for-session-refresh)

In v1, `Supabase.initialize()` would await for the session to be refreshed before returning.
This caused delays in the app's launch time, especially when the app is opened in a poor network environment.

In v2, `Supabase.initialize()` returns immediately after obtaining the session from the local storage, which makes the app launch faster.
Because of this, there is no guarantee that the session is valid when the app starts.

If you need to make sure the session is valid, you can access the `isExpired` getter to check if the session is valid.
If the session is expired, you can listen to the `onAuthStateChange` event and wait for a new `tokenRefreshed` event to be fired.

BeforeAfter

```
1
2

// Session is valid, no check requiredfinal session = supabase.auth.currentSession;
```

#### Removing Flutter Webview dependency for OAuth sign in [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#removing-flutter-webview-dependency-for-oauth-sign-in)

In v1, on iOS you could pass a `BuildContext` to the `signInWithOAuth()` method to launch the OAuth flow in a Flutter Webview.

In v2, we have dropped the [webview\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) dependency in v2 to allow you to have full control over the UI of the OAuth flow.
We now have [native support for Google and Apple sign in](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithidtoken), so opening an external browser is no longer needed on iOS.

Because of this update, we no longer need the `context` parameter, so we have removed the `context` parameter from the `signInWithOAuth()` method.

BeforeAfter

```
1
2
3
4
5
6

// Opens a webview on iOS.await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth(  Provider.github,  authScreenLaunchMode: LaunchMode.inAppWebView,  context: context,);
```

#### PKCE is the default auth flow type [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#pkce-is-the-default-auth-flow-type)

[PKCE flow](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-auth-sso-pkce#introducing-pkce), which is a more secure method for obtaining sessions from deep links, is now the default auth flow for any authentication involving deep links.

BeforeAfter

```

3
4
5

await Supabase.initialize(  url: 'SUPABASE_URL',  anonKey: 'SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',  authFlowType: AuthFlowType.implicit, // set to implicit by default);
```

#### Auth callback host name parameter removed [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#auth-callback-host-name-parameter-removed)

`Supabase.initialize()` no longer has the `authCallbackUrlHostname` parameter.
The `supabase_flutter` SDK will automatically detect auth callback URLs and handle them internally.

BeforeAfter

```
1
2
3
4
5

await Supabase.initialize(  url: 'SUPABASE_URL',  anonKey: 'SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',  authCallbackUrlHostname: 'auth-callback',);
```

#### SupabaseAuth class removed [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#supabaseauth-class-removed)

The `SupabaseAuth` had an `initialSession` member, which was used to obtain the initial session upon app start.
This is now removed, and `currentSession` should be used to access the session at any time.

BeforeAfter

```
1
2

// Use `initialSession` to obtain the initial session when the app starts.final initialSession = await SupabaseAuth.initialSession;
```

### Data methods [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#data-methods)

#### Insert and return data [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#insert-and-return-data)

We made the query builder immutable, which means you can reuse the same query object to chain multiple filters and get the expected outcome.

BeforeAfter

```
1

3
4
5

// If you declare a query and chain filters on itfinal myQuery = supabase.from('my_table').select();final foo = await myQuery.eq('some_col', 'foo');// The `eq` filter above is applied in addition to the following filterfinal bar = await myQuery.eq('another_col', 'bar');
```

#### Renaming is and in filter [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#renaming-is-and-in-filter)

Because `is` and `in` are [reserved keywords](https://dart.dev/languages/keywords) in Dart, v1 used `is_` and `in_` as query filter names.
Users found the underscore confusing, so the query filters are now renamed to `isFilter` and `inFilter`.

BeforeAfter

final data = await supabase  .from('users')  .select()  .is_('status', null);final data = await supabase  .from('users')  .select()  .in_('status', ['ONLINE', 'OFFLINE']);
```

#### Deprecate FetchOption in favor of `count()` and `head()` methods [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#deprecate-fetchoption-in-favor-of-count-and-head-methods)

`FetchOption()` on `.select()` is now deprecated, and new `.count()` and `head()` methods are added to the query builder.

`count()` on `.select()` performs the select while also getting the count value, and `.count()` directly on `.from()` performs a head request resulting in only fetching the count value.

```

#### PostgREST error codes [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#postgrest-error-codes)

The `PostgrestException` instance thrown by the API methods has a `code` property. In v1, the `code` property contained the http status code.

In v2, the `code` property contains the [PostgREST error code](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/errors.html), which is more useful for debugging.

BeforeAfter

```
1
2
3
4
5

try {  await supabase.from('countries').select();} on PostgrestException catch (error) {  error.code; // Contains http status code}
```

### Realtime methods [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#realtime-methods)

Realtime methods contains the biggest breaking changes. Most of these changes are to make the interface more type safe.

We have removed the `.on()` method and replaced it with `.onPostgresChanges()`, `.onBroadcast()`, and three different presence methods.

#### Postgres Changes [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#postgres-changes)

Use the new `.onPostgresChanges()` method to listen to realtime changes in the database.

In v1, filters were not strongly typed because they took a `String` type. In v2, `filter` takes an object. Its properties are strictly typed to catch type errors.

The payload of the callback is now typed as well. In `v1`, the payload was returned as `dynamic`. It is now returned as a `PostgresChangePayload` object. The object contains the `oldRecord` and `newRecord` properties for accessing the data before and after the change.

```

#### Broadcast [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#broadcast)

Broadcast now uses the dedicated `.onBroadcast()` method, rather than the generic `.on()` method.
Because the method is specific to broadcast, it takes fewer properties.

```

#### Presence [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-createuser\#presence)

Realtime Presence gets three different methods for listening to three different presence events: `sync`, `join`, and `leave`.
This allows the callback to be strictly typed.

```

* * *

## Fetch data

Perform a SELECT query on the table or view.

- By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
- `select()` can be combined with [Filters](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/using-filters)
- `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/using-modifiers)
- `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform) and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

### Parameters

- columnsOptionalString



The columns to retrieve, separated by commas. Columns can be renamed when returned with `customName:columnName`

## Update data

Perform an UPDATE on the table or view.

- `update()` should always be combined with [Filters](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to update.

### Parameters

- valuesRequiredMap<String, dynamic>



The values to update with.

```

Data source

* * *

## Upsert data

Perform an UPSERT on the table or view. Depending on the column(s) passed to `onConflict`, `.upsert()` allows you to perform the equivalent of `.insert()` if a row with the corresponding `onConflict` columns doesn't exist, or if it does exist, perform an alternative action depending on `ignoreDuplicates`.

- Primary keys must be included in `values` to use upsert.

### Parameters

- valuesRequiredMap<String, dynamic> or List<Map<String, dynamic>>



The values to upsert with. Pass a Map to upsert a single row or an array to upsert multiple rows.

- onConflictOptionalString



Comma-separated UNIQUE column(s) to specify how duplicate rows are determined. Two rows are duplicates if all the `onConflict` columns are equal.

- ignoreDuplicatesOptionalbool



If `true`, duplicate rows are ignored. If `false`, duplicate rows are merged with existing rows.

- defaultToNullOptionalbool



Make missing fields default to `null`. Otherwise, use the default value for the column. This only applies when inserting new rows, not when merging with existing rows where ignoreDuplicates is set to false. This also only applies when doing bulk upserts.

## Delete data

Perform a DELETE on the table or view.

- `delete()` should always be combined with [Filters](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
- If you use `delete()` with filters and you have RLS enabled, only rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that makes the rows visible.

## Call a Postgres function

Perform a function call.

You can call Postgres functions as Remote Procedure Calls, logic in your database that you can execute from anywhere. Functions are useful when the logic rarely changes—like for password resets and updates.

### Parameters

- fnRequiredString



The function name to call.

- paramsOptionalMap<String, dynamic>



The arguments to pass to the function call.

## Using filters

Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

If a Database function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

\
## Using modifiers\
\
Filters work on the row level. That is, they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).\
\
Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).\

## Using explain\
\
For debugging slow queries, you can get the [Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) of a query using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.\
\
Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database. It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.\
\
Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance) to enable the functionality on your project.\
\
### Parameters\
\
- analyzeOptionalbool\
\
\
\
If `true`, the query will be executed and the actual run time will be returned.\
\
- verboseOptionalbool\
\
\
\
If `true`, the query identifier will be returned and `data` will include the output columns of the query.\
\
- settingsOptionalbool\
\
\
\
If `true`, include information on configuration parameters that affect query planning.\
\
- buffersOptionalbool\
\
\
\
If `true`, include information on buffer usage.\
\
- walOptionalbool\
\
\
\
If `true`, include information on WAL record generation.\

## Create a new user\
\
Creates a new user.\
\
- By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).\
- **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.\
\
  - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.\
  - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.\
- When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).\
- If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:\
  - When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.\
  - When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.\

\
## Sign in a user through SSO\
\
- Before you can call this method you need to [establish a connection](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections) to an identity provider. Use the [CLI commands](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso) to do this.\
- If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.\
- In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `providerId` property. For example:\
\
  - Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.\
  - Using different hints to identify the correct identity provider, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.\
\

\
## Auth MFA\
\
This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.\
\
Currently, Supabase supports time-based one-time password (TOTP) and phone verification code as the 2nd factor. Recovery codes are not supported but users can enroll multiple factors, with an upper limit of 10..\
\
Having a 2nd factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup factor.\
\
Learn more about implementing MFA on your application on our guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa#overview).\
\
* * *\
\
## Enroll a factor\
\
Starts the enrollment process for a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) factor. This method creates a new `unverified` factor. To verify a factor, present the QR code or secret to the user and ask them to add it to their authenticator app. The user has to enter the code from their authenticator app to verify it.\
\
- Use `totp` or `phone` as the `factorType` and the returned `id` to create a challenge.\
- To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-challenge).\
- To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-verify).\
- To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challengeAndVerify()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-challengeandverify).\

## Get Authenticator Assurance Level\
\
Returns the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) for the active session.\
\
- Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.\
- In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` means the user has signed in with their first factor, such as email, password, or OAuth sign-in. An AAL of `aal2` means the user has also signed in with their second factor, such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).\
- If the user has a verified factor, the `nextLevel` field returns `aal2`. Otherwise, it returns `aal1`.\
\
Get the AAL details of a session\
\
```\

\
## Listen to database changes\
\
Returns real-time data from your table as a `Stream`.\
\
- Realtime is disabled by default for new tables. You can turn it on by [managing replication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes#replication-setup).\
- `stream()` will emit the initial data as well as any further change on the database as `Stream<List<Map<String, dynamic>>>` by combining Postgrest and Realtime.\
- Takes a list of primary key column names that will be used to update and delete the proper records within the SDK.\
- The following filters are available\
  - `.eq('column', value)` listens to rows where the column equals the value\
  - `.neq('column', value)` listens to rows where the column does not equal the value\
  - `.gt('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is greater than the value\
  - `.gte('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is greater than or equal to the value\
  - `.lt('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is less than the value\
  - `.lte('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is less than or equal to the value\
  - `.inFilter('column', [val1, val2, val3])` listens to rows where the column is one of the values\
\
Listen to a tableWith filter, order and limitWith an IN filterUsing \`stream()\` with \`StreamBuilder\`\
\
```\

5\
\
supabase.from('countries')  .stream(primaryKey: ['id'])  .listen((List<Map<String, dynamic>> data) {  // Do something awesome with the data});\
```\
\
* * *\
\
## Subscribe to channel\
\
Subscribe to realtime changes in your database.\
\
- Realtime is disabled by default for new tables. You can turn it on by [managing replication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes#replication-setup).\
- If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes, you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this: `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`\
\
Listen to database changesListen to insertsListen to updatesListen to deletesListen to multiple eventsListen to row level changesListen to broadcast messagesListen to presence events\

```\
\
* * *\
\
## Unsubscribe from a channel\
\
Unsubscribes and removes Realtime channel from Realtime client.\
\
- Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.\
