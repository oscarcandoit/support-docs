# Manage Point-in-Time Recovery usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You can configure [Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery) for a project by enabling the [PITR add-on](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons?panel=pitr). You are charged for every enabled PITR add-on across your projects.

## How charges are calculated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#how-charges-are-calculated)

PITR is charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that PITR is active for a project. If PITR is active for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#example)

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you activate PITR for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.

| Time Window | PITR Activated | Hours Billed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM | No | 0 |  |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM | No | 0 |  |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM | Yes | 1 | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Yes | 511 |  |

### Usage on your invoice [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#usage-on-your-invoice)

Usage is shown as "Point-in-time recovery Hours" on your invoice.

## Pricing [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#pricing)

### Pricing [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#pricing)

Pricing depends on the recovery retention period, which determines how many days back you can restore data to any chosen point of up to seconds in granularity.

| Recovery Retention Period in Days | Hourly Price USD | Monthly Price USD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | $0.137 | $100 |
| 14 | $0.274 | $200 |
| 28 | $0.55 | $400 |

For a detailed breakdown of how charges are calculated, refer to [Manage Point-in-Time Recovery usage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery).

## Billing examples [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#billing-examples)

### One project [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#one-project)

## Optimize usage [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery\#optimize-usage)

- Review your [backup frequency](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/backups#frequency-of-backups) needs to determine whether you require PITR or free Daily Backups are sufficient
- Regularly check your projects and disable PITR where no longer needed
- Consider disabling PITR for non-production databases
