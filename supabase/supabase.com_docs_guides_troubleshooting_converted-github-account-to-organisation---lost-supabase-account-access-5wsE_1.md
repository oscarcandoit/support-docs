# Converted GitHub account to organization / GitHub Account was deleted - Lost Supabase account access

[Converting](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/converting-a-user-into-an-organization) your GitHub account to a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts) will cause you to lose access to all other accounts using GitHub sign-ins.

If possible, create a new GitHub account using the **same email** as the previous GitHub account that was turned into a Organization or that was deleted. Once you sign in with that newly created account, you should have access to the old account. You can then invite any new account to have access to the Organization and Projects as needed.

If that is not possible, Supabase can help you transfer ownership of an existing organization on your account by inviting a new owner to your organization. This new user will need to have a different email from the previous one, and you will need to email [support@supabase.com](mailto:support@supabase.com) with that new email as well to confirm that you own the email address.
