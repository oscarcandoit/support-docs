# App Template Project

To assist developers to get up and running quicker, Jobber has created an App
Template Project that can be downloaded from GitHub. The project is divided into
2 main repositories, one for the frontend in React, and a second for the backend
and API portion in Ruby on Rails.

The README file contains instructions around prerequisites, setup, running the
app, and recommended deployment steps.
