## Overview

Quotes serve as professional estimates you provide to clients, outlining the services and costs associated with a potential job. Within Jobber, quotes are fully integrated with your workflow—enabling you to effortlessly convert them into jobs, schedule the work, and generate invoices when approved.

You can access and manage quotes from multiple places:

- **Client profile**: From under the “Quotes” tab within the client overview.

- **Quotes list**: Select **Quotes** from the side navigation to open the quotes list where you can sort, filter, and search through all quotes in your account.

- The **More Actions** button from **Home**
- The **More Actions** button on a **Client Page**
- The **Create** button on the side navigation
- **\+ New Quote** the **Quotes** list

**At the top of the new quote screen, you can:**

- Add a **Title** for this work. This is an internal field that only you will be able to see on the quote, it is not visible to your client. When you convert the quote to a job, the job title will transfer to the job however it will not be visible to your client.

  - **Note**: If you need the Job title field to be visible to your client, an option is to create a [custom field](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735928) then make it client facing in your [PDF settings](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009566987).
- Select a **Client**. This is the person you're doing the work for. The quote cannot be saved without a client.
- Add a **Salesperson**. This is the team member who sold this work. When added on a quote, the salesperson is visible on any jobs and invoices that come from this quote. Salespeople are also visible in the salesperson performance report. Learn more about [Salesperson Attribution](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/25806091364375).
- Fill in or add in a new **custom field** for all quotes. [Learn more about Custom Fields](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735928).

![Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 11.24.27 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/33799783466903)

**In the middle of the quote, you can:**

- Add **line items**. These are the products and services you are offering this client. Line items can be added from your products and services list, or added as a custom line item. For each line item, add a:

  - Name (required)
  - Description
  - Quantity (required)
  - Unit cost
  - Unit price
  - Total

In the line item quote description, once you've entered some text, a **Rewrite** button will appear. This button uses AI to rewrite the text you've entered to help make sure your quote line items are well-written. Once you click the button, there are options for rewrite the text to be more:

- Cheerful
- Casual
- Professional
- Shorter

If you need to provide more information; [add text to your quote](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054025193). Text is commonly used to:

- Include a description to help your clients choose between [optional line items](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046575473)
- Include information such as the scope of work
- Include details about warranties or terms of service

If you are subscribed to Jobber's [Grow Plan](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050124513), there are additional options of quotes, including adding an [optional line item](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046575473) or an [image to your line items](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049503713). Learn more about [Quoting on the Grow Plan](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049853114)

![Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 11.36.37 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/33799767842327)

**Note**: A quote can support up to 100 line items.

**From the bottom of the quote, you can:**

- Select **Add a Discount** to add a [discount](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009686768) as a dollar value or percentage. This discount transfer to the invoice that is created from the job that this quote is converted to. Discounts do not appear on jobs.
- Edit the **tax rate**. Making changes to the tax rate on a quote will only affect that one quote and not your full Jobber account. [Learn how to create a default tax rate for your account.](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014367307-Tax-Settings)
- Add a **Required Deposit** to be collected when your client approves the quote. If you have Jobber Payments enabled, clients can pay this deposit directly from their client hub. [Learn more about Deposits on Quotes](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009379007).
- Change the **Client view** for what will be visible to the client on the PDF of the quote. Click **Change** then check the boxes to adjust what clients will see on this quote, including:


  - Quantities
  - Unit prices,
  - Line item totals
  - Totals

![change client view.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/33799783468951)

![Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 11.49.56 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/33799767843607)

- Add a **Client message** for the quote. Once you've entered your message, a **Rewrite** button will appear. This button uses AI to rewrite the text you've entered into the client message field. Once you click the button, there are options for rewrite the text to be more:


  - Cheerful
  - Casual
  - Professional
  - Shorter
- Add a contract/disclaimer for this specific quote. By default the contract disclaimer on quotes is pulled from your **Client document settings** (located in your [business profile)](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735608), however it can be customized directly on the quote. Once you've added a disclaimer to the quote, check the box for **Apply to all future quotes** to use this disclaimer on new quotes going forward and replace the contract/disclaimer entered in your client document settings.

![Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 11.47.45 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/33799783471639)

## Save and update options on quotes

When you save a quote for the first time, there are two options:

- **Save quote:** This saves the quote and takes you out of the edit screen, back to the top of the quote where you can review the changes that you've made. The quote will be saved as a draft.
- **Save and...:** Click the down arrow beside the **Save Quote** button to open a list of other actions you can do in addition to saving the quote. These are things that might save you a step or a few clicks. Your options are to:
  - **Save and Send as Email:** The quote is saved and emailed to the client.
  - **Save and Send as Text Message:** The quote is saved and texted to the client.
  - **Save and Convert to Job:** The quote is saved and then converted into a job. The job will have the same line items and costs as the quote.
  - **Save and Mark as Awaiting Response:** The quote is saved and instead of being a draft, the quote status is changed to 'Awaiting Response'.

Once a quote has already been created, the button changes from **Save Quote** to **Update Quote**.

There are a number of actions that can be performed once a quote has been created. These can be found in the **More Actions** menu in the top right corner of the quote:

![more actions menu](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/23063276290967)

Under the **More Actions** menu, you can select the following:

- **Edit:** To change information for this quote.
- **Convert to Job:** To convert this quote into a scheduled job—this will change this quote's status to **Converted**
- **Create Similar Quote:** This option copies the line items on the quote and prompts you to select a client to assign this quote to.
- **Text Message:** This option sends the quote to your client via text message. They will be able to view the quote online to request changes or approve and will also receive a PDF attachment for their records. Before the text message is sent, the text message can be edited.
- **Email to Client:** By emailing the quote to your client, they will be able to view the quote online to request changes or approve and will also receive a PDF attachment for their records. Before the email is sent, it can be edited.
- **Mark as Awaiting Response:** If you print the quote to provide to your client, choose this option to change statuses so the quote no longer shows as a draft.
- **Mark as Approved:** This will change the quote status right to approved, eliminating the need for your client to approve online. This option is perfect for those times where your client agrees verbally with the outlined work.
- **Mark as Archived:** Change the status of the quote to archived. This option works well when the work will not be moving ahead.
- **Preview as Client:** View how the quote will look to a client viewing it in client hub.
- **Collect Signature:** If your client is present and you require a signature to proceed, choose this option.
- **Download PDF:** To generate a copy of what this PDF will look like when sent out to your client.
- **Print:** Opens the quote as a PDF to be printed.

**Note:** You can edit the [email and text message templates](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/9335574672151) for quotes and quote approvals by clicking the **gear icon**, selecting **Settings**, and then choosing **Emails and Text Messages**.

#### Archiving quotes

If you have a quote in Jobber that doesn't end up getting converted to a job, you can archive it. This will change the quote's status from Sent to Archived. To do this, go to the quote and click **More Actions**, then select **Archive Quote.** This option will only be available if the quote is no longer showing as a Draft.

![](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/23064529520023)![more actions menu with archived highlighted](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22326315032343)

The quote will be saved and kept on the client's profile and in the Archived section for quotes.

## Quotes list

Select **Quotes** from the side navigation to open your quotes list.

![Quotes list page showing item statuses on the right side](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22599740115607)

At the top of the list are some key metrics relating to quotes to help you understand how your business is performing, including:

- **Conversion rate**: The conversion rate is calculated as ((number of quotes converted in the date period ) / number of quotes sent in the date period) + (number of quotes with a converted date in the date period) \* 100%.

Since this measures a specific date range, it's possible that there may be more converted quotes than sent quotes within that date range, which means that the quote conversion rate may exceed 100%.

The trend indicator for the conversion rate is calculated as ((conversion rate in current date period) - (conversion rate in previous date period) / (conversion rate in previous date period) \* 100.
- **Sent quotes**: These are quotes that have a sent date within this date period. The dollar value displayed reflects the value of sent quotes after discounts and tax.

The trend indicator is calculated by ((quote sent in current date period) - (quotes sent in previous date period) / (quotes sent in previous date period) \* 100.
- **Converted quotes**: These are quotes that have been converted to a job within this date period. The dollar value displayed reflects the value of converted quotes after discounts and tax.

The trend indicator is calculated by ((quote conversion rate in current date period) - (quote conversion rate in previous date period) / (quotes conversion rate in previous date period) \* 100.

![](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22773890094103)

The quotes list is where you'll find a list of all your quotes where you can filter by [status](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009378727-Quote-Basics#h_5f401d9d-ff23-4558-8e13-88728245f382) as well as sorting by:

- Client
  - first name (A-Z)
  - first name (Z-A)
- Quote number
- Created date
- Status
- Total

### Quote statuses

There are 6 statuses a quote can be in:

1. **Draft:** This is a quote that has not been sent to your client yet, and is only visible to you. Once a quote has been sent (or marked awaiting response) it is not possible to put the quote back into draft status.
2. **Awaiting response:** This is a quote that has been sent to your client and is awaiting approval or a change request.
3. **Changes Requested:** This is a quote that a client is requesting changes on.
4. **Approved:** This is a quote that has been approved by the client, or has been marked as approved manually. [Learn more about Quote Approvals](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012715008-Quote-Approvals)
5. **Converted:** A quote that has been converted into a job. Converted is a final status for a quote,  once it's converted the status will stay converted even if the linked job is deleted.
6. **Archived:** A quote that has been archived in the system. These are only visible to you in Jobber, not to your clients in client hub.

## Quote PDFs

A PDF version of the quote can be downloaded from the quote by clicking **More Actions** then select **Download PDF**. Your client can also download a PDF of the quote in [client hub](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009571307) by clicking **Download PDF**.

When emailing a quote to a client, if you would like to include the quote PDF as an email attachment, in the attachments section of the email preview screen, make sure to check the box to include the PDF as an attachment. By default quote PDFs are not attached to the email and your client will be prompted to view the quote in client hub where they can approve the quote, request changes, and pay deposits.

![Email preview screen](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22326315125271)

You can customize your quote PDF to include custom fields for your clients and add a contract or disclaimer. The contract/disclaimer will appear in the bottom left corner of each quote PDF you send, allowing you to add agreement verbiage or terms and conditions.

To adjust these settings:

1. Click the **Gear Icon**.

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Choose **Business Profile** from the settings menu.

4. Locate the **Client Document Settings** section of your business profile and select **Edit Settings**.

5. In the pop-up window, go to the **Quotes** tab, where you'll find a field to add your contract/disclaimer and other quote document settings.
