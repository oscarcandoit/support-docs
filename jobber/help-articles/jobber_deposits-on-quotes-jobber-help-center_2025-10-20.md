### Overview

If you need to collect money upfront from your client, you can add a **Required Deposit** to quotes. Clients will see that there is a deposit on the quote so they know how much to pay you. When a deposit is recorded on a quote, it will transfer to the first invoice created for this job generated from the quote.

If you are using Jobber Payments, [clients can pay the required deposit online](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009611207) using a card.

To add a required deposit to a quote, go to the quote and click **More** **Actions > Edit**. Under the quote total click **Add Required Deposit**.

![the area at the bottom of a quote where you can add the required deposit amount.](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22329661113751)

After this is saved, you'll see the required deposit at the bottom of the quote. Your client will then see in client hub and on the quote PDF that a deposit is required to begin the work.

### Record deposits on quotes

If you are using Jobber Payments, you can email the quote to the client and they can pay the deposit amount via a button on the email. You can also click **Collect Deposit** to charge their credit card through Jobber Payments.

If a client pays by a different method, you can click **More** **Actions > Record Deposit** on the quote. A box will pop up for you to record it.

**Note**: Collect Deposit will appear when you are using Jobber Payments, Record Deposit will appear for other payment integrations as you are recording that a deposit was accepted outside of Jobber.

Deposits appear in the client's billing history box and update the account balance.

If you click on a deposit in the billing history box, it will give you the ability to send a receipt to the client, show the details of the deposit, and which quote it is associated with.

Once the full amount of the required deposit has been recorded, the required deposit on the quote will say **PAID** beside it.

### How clients pay deposits online through client hub

When a quote is emailed or texted to a client they'll be able to click **View Quote** to access that quote in client hub.

![Screen_Shot_2021-08-18_at_4.36.29_PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/19466906700311)

Once in client hub, they will need to select **Approve & Pay Deposit** to make the payment [online with Jobber Payments](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009611207).

If your client intends to pay with an offline payment method such as cash or check, they won't be able to approve the quote in client hub. Once you've received payment or gotten verbal approval from your client, this quote will need to be [marked as approved internally](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012715008-Quote-Approvals#h_01EVFESDFPBDF9YKX6QE3H7WKH) by you or a team member.

If you are not using Jobber Payments, this button will say **Approve** and there will be no online payment option to pay this quote's deposit online.

Alternatively, they can also click **Request Changes** to enter their feedback if there is anything missing from this quote.

![Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 10.39.07 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/27577401491479)

After clicking **Approve & Pay Deposit**, if you have the **Require client signatures** setting enabled (this setting is under **Gear Icon > Settings > Client hub**), your client will be prompted to sign to approve the quote. They can chose to sign their name either by drawing it or typing it. Next they will be prompted to enter their payment information. They can opt to save their credit card for future use by checking the box for **Remember this card for future payments**.

**![approve and pay 3.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/27577354837143)**

**Note**: Clients cannot make partial payments on quote deposits.

Their payment method will be processed and if the payment is successful, they will see a notification that the transaction was successful.

If you view the client's profile in Jobber.com you will see this deposit recorded in their billing history box. If the client allowed the card to be securely saved for future use you will also see that information below the billing history box.

![](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22354374370327)

If notifications are enabled for Jobber Payment receipts, administrators will be emailed a notification that the client paid.

### View deposits on jobs

When a quote with a required deposit is converted to a job, the deposit information will be visible when creating or editing the job. The deposit information does not appear on the saved job, only the create or edit screen.

### Add a deposit to an invoice

If a client has paid a deposit and the deposit needs to be applied towards an invoice, it can be added while creating the invoice or later by editing the invoice.

If you have already added a deposit towards this invoice, the applied deposit(s) will be listed in the deposit section or if you the quote (with a deposit) is converted to a job, then later an invoice is generated, the deposit will be automatically be applied to the invoice since it's linked to the original quote.

To add a deposit to an invoice, navigate to the invoice, then select **Edit**. Scroll towards the section of the invoice near the total, then select **Add deposit**.

![Add deposit](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22353102312983)

Next, you'll be prompted to either add a deposit manually or add an unapplied deposit from the client's account balance. Deposits collected through Jobber Payments can be applied to the invoice using this method as well as deposits that were paid by cash, check, or another payment method.

If you are adding a new deposit, you'll be prompted to select the payment method, deposit amount, transaction date, and add any details.

![New deposit](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22353133322775)

![Find and select which deposit record to associate with window](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22353133337495)

Once you've entered the all the information, select **Save** and the deposit will be added to the invoice. The deposit will also appear in the client's bulling history box as a record of their payment.
