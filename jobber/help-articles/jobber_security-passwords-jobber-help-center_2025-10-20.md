### Overview

Your Jobber account is connected to the email address that you sign into Jobber with. That email address is what is used if you need to reset your password to Jobber, so the second step to keeping your Jobber account secure is to make sure that your email account is equally secure with its own unique strong password.

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 3.50.15 PM (1).png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/25706266070551)

We strongly recommend that each user has their own individual login, rather than share a login. This allows permission settings to be set individually for each user to give them access to only what they need. It is also easier to tell who did what in the account. For example, when a visit is marked complete, it will show the user's name who marked it complete.

The first step to keeping your Jobber account secure is making sure that you use a secure password:

- We suggest using a strong password that contains a combination of characters, such as upper and lowercase, numbers, or symbols.
- Create a new password rather than reusing a previous password.
- Do not share your password with other people.
- Use a different password for your Jobber account than other logins.

### How to reset your own password

From the log in page online or in the app click [Forgot your password?](https://secure.getjobber.com/password_resets/new)

You will be asked to enter your email address, and an email will be sent to you to reset your password.

### How to send a password reset to a team member

An admin user can send a password reset link any user on the account by going to the **Gear Icon > Manage Team** and clicking on the user's name. From this page, click on **Send a password reset email**. They will then get an email so they can reset their password securely.

![Manage team settings for a user showing their personal info and a button to send password reset email](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22773126798231)

### What if my password has been identified as a potential security risk?

Jobber uses a third party service to detect email address and password combinations that have previously been exposed in a publicly-disclosed database incident.

![ ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/25706282014871)

If you have received the following message when signing into Jobber:

_Your password has been identified as a potential security risk, likely due to reuse across multiple services. To protect your account, we have temporarily blocked access. Please change your password to continue._

We ask that you change your password as a security measure.

To change your password, click "forgot password" on the log in page, or use this link: [https://secure.getjobber.com/password\_resets/new](https://secure.getjobber.com/password_resets/new)

### Two-step verification for Jobber Payments

Two-step verification is an extra layer of security to protect your Jobber account and uses your trusted mobile phone number to protect certain actions that are associated with Jobber Payments. With two-step verification, when making important changes to your Jobber Payments settings or following an unusual login you will be required to enter a verification code that is sent to your mobile phone via text message. While two-step verification is not required on every login, having to enter a code when making sensitive changes prevents anyone else from making changes to your account even if they know your password. This adds an additional level of security to your Jobber account.

Two-step verification can only be set up by account owners.

#### Important

For security purposes, your verification code should never be shared with anyone else. Jobber will never ask you to share your verification code with our team.
