Elementor CoreBasic

Elementor contains numerous components developers can modify to extend Elementor’s capabilities. This section contains a list of components currently covered by this documentation.

## [\#](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/getting-started/components/\#available-components) Available Components

Below is a list of Elementor components, along with a short description and links to more in-depth information:

- [Widgets](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/widgets/)

Elementor contains dozens of useful widgets in the widgets panel. Developers can create their own widgets, introducing advanced functionality not currently present in Elementor.

- [Controls](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/controls/)

Elementor Controls are input fields and UI elements used to construct an interface. Developers can customize the available settings and change the design in the editor’s preview area.

- [Dynamic Tags](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/dynamic-tags/)

Dynamic Tags are used to insert customized data based on various sources. Addon developers can create a wide range of dynamic tags, and even use external APIs to pull data to Elementor.

- [Form Actions](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/form-actions/)

Form actions are tasks taken after a visitor has submitted form data. An action can send the form data by email, redirect to a different page, or send the data to an external service.

- [Form Fields](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/form-fields/)

Form fields help users to create web forms using the Elementor Form widget. Addon developers can extend the dozens of built-in field types to add new field types.

- [Themes Conditions](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/theme-conditions/)

The theme builder uses a condition-based mechanism to display template. The mechanism cover the native WordPress Template Hierarchy, but developers can add additional conditions.

- [Themes Locations](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/themes/)

The theme builder transformed Elementor from a page builder to a full site builder. Theme developers can make their themes “Elementor compatible” with theme locations.

- [Context Menu](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/context-menu/)

When editing elements in the preview area, right clicking an element accesses actions that can be applied via a context menu. Custom actions can be added to these context menus.

- [Finder](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/finder/)

The finder offers easy access to many pages and settings on the site. Developers can extend the finder, adding and removing items and categories.


## [\#](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/getting-started/components/\#more-components) More Components

As Elementor grows, we will be adding documentation for more components. This is part of our fundamental commitment to encourage and support third-party developers. As part of this process, we are doing everything possible to simplify our codebase, making it easier for external developers to implement their ideas within the Elementor infrastructure.
