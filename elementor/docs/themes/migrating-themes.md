Elementor ProIntermediate

Now we'll see how to support Elementor theme locations in your theme. The logic behind the process is simple, you just need to wrap your code with an Elementor function/hook that checks to see if the user prefers using the Elementor template or the original theme design.

There are two ways to support Elementor locations - you can either use custom Elementor _functions_ or _hooks_. Both ways will work. With hooks, the entire logic is in the `functions.php` file. With functions, the checks are inside the theme files.
