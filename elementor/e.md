We are working on a new JS API for Elementor to make everything simpler and to have better capabilities.

As a part of the new JS API integration, in Elementor 2.7.0, the Editor UI will use parts of the new API.

To make sure that Elementor and Elementor Pro will continue to play nicely together, anyone running Elementor Pro **MUST** update Elementor Pro to v2.6.3+ prior to upgrading Elementor to 2.7.

We don’t foresee any issues arising from this implementation with any 3rd party plugin, but with that said, any 3rd party plugin/theme extension developer that implements tweaks to Elementor Library or listening on changes between screens in the panel should double-check and see that everything is running smooth.
