# Custom Roles

## Learn about using custom roles with storage schema

* * *

In this guide, you will learn how to create and use custom roles with Storage to manage role-based access to objects and buckets. The same approach can be used to use custom roles with any other Supabase service.

Supabase Storage uses the same role-based access control system as any other Supabase service using RLS (Row Level Security).

## Create a custom role [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/schema/custom-roles\#create-a-custom-role)

Let's create a custom role `manager` to provide full read access to a specific bucket. For a more advanced setup, see the [RBAC Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac#create-auth-hook-to-apply-user-role).

```

create role 'manager';-- Important to grant the role to the authenticator and anon rolegrant manager to authenticator;grant anon to manager;
```

## Create a policy [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/schema/custom-roles\#create-a-policy)

Let's create a policy that gives full read permissions to all objects in the bucket `teams` for the `manager` role.

```

create policy "Manager can view all files in the bucket 'teams'"on storage.objectsfor selectto managerusing ( bucket_id = 'teams');
```

## Test the policy [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/schema/custom-roles\#test-the-policy)

To impersonate the `manager` role, you will need a valid JWT token with the `manager` role.
You can quickly create one using the `jsonwebtoken` library in Node.js.

Signing a new JWT requires your `JWT_SECRET`. You must store this secret securely. Never expose it in frontend code, and do not check it into version control.

```

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')const JWT_SECRET = 'your-jwt-secret' // You can find this in your Supabase project settings under API. Store this securely.const USER_ID = '' // the user id that we want to give the manager roleconst token = jwt.sign({ role: 'manager', sub: USER_ID }, JWT_SECRET, {  expiresIn: '1h',})
```

Now you can use this token to access the Storage API.

```

const { StorageClient } = require('@supabase/storage-js')const PROJECT_URL = 'https://your-project-id.supabase.co/storage/v1'const storage = new StorageClient(PROJECT_URL, {  authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,})await storage.from('teams').list()
```
