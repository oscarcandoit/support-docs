# Manage Custom Domain usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You can configure a [custom domain](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains) for a project by enabling the [Custom Domain add-on](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons?panel=customDomain). You are charged for all custom domains configured across your projects.

## How charges are calculated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#how-charges-are-calculated)

Custom domains are charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that a custom domain is active. If a custom domain is active for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#example)

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you activate a custom domain for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.

| Time Window | Custom Domain Activated | Hours Billed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM | No | 0 |  |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM | No | 0 |  |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM | Yes | 1 | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Yes | 511 |  |

### Usage on your invoice [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#usage-on-your-invoice)

Usage is shown as "Custom Domain Hours" on your invoice.

## Pricing [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#pricing)

$0.0137 per hour ($10 per month).

## Billing examples [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#billing-examples)

### One project [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#one-project)

## Optimize usage [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains\#optimize-usage)
