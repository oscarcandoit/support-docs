# Reports

* * *

Supabase Reports provide comprehensive observability for your project through dedicated monitoring dashboards that visualize key metrics across your database, auth, storage, realtime, and API systems. Each report offers self-debugging tools to gain actionable insights for optimizing performance and troubleshooting issues.

Reports are only available for projects hosted on the Supabase Cloud platform and are not available for self-hosted instances.

## Using reports [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/reports\#using-reports)

Reports can be filtered by time range to focus your analysis on specific periods. Available time ranges are gated by your organization's plan, with higher-tier plans providing access to longer historical periods.

| Time Range | Free | Pro | Team | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Last 10 minutes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
