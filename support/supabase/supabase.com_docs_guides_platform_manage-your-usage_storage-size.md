# Manage Storage size usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You are charged for the total size of all assets in your buckets.

## How charges are calculated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#how-charges-are-calculated)

Storage size is charged by Gigabyte-Hours (GB-Hrs). 1 GB-Hr represents the use of 1 GB of storage for 1 hour.
For example, storing 10 GB of data for 5 hours results in 50 GB-Hrs (10 GB × 5 hours).

### Usage on your invoice [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#usage-on-your-invoice)

Usage is shown as "Storage Size GB-Hrs" on your invoice.

## Pricing [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#pricing)

$0.00002919 per GB-Hr ($0.021 per GB per month). You are only
charged for usage exceeding your subscription plan's quota.

| Plan | Quota in GB | Over-Usage per GB | Quota in GB-Hrs | Over-Usage per GB-Hr |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 1 | - | 744 | - |
| Pro | 100 | $0.021 | 74,400 | $0.00002919 |
| Team | 100 | $0.021 | 74,400 | $0.00002919 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom | Custom |

## Billing examples [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#billing-examples)

### Within quota [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#within-quota)

The organization's Storage size usage is within the quota, so no charges for Storage size apply.

| Line Item | Units | Costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pro Plan | 1 | $25 |
| Compute Hours Micro | 744 hours | $10 |
| Storage Size | 85 GB | $0 |
| **Subtotal** |  | **$35** |
| Compute Credits |  | -$10 |
| **Total** |  | **$25** |

### Exceeding quota [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#exceeding-quota)

The organization's Storage size usage exceeds the quota by 257 GB, incurring charges for this additional usage.

| Line Item | Units | Costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pro Plan | 1 | $25 |
| Compute Hours Micro | 744 hours | $10 |
| Storage Size | 357 GB | $5.4 |
| **Subtotal** |  | **$40.4** |
| Compute Credits |  | -$10 |
| **Total** |  | **$30.4** |

## View usage [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#view-usage)

### Usage page [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#usage-page)

You can view Storage size usage on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage). The page shows the usage of all projects by default. To view the usage for a specific project, select it from the dropdown. You can also select a different time period.

![Usage page navigation bar](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fimg%2Fguides%2Fplatform%2Fusage-navbar--light.png&w=3840&q=75)

In the Storage size section, you can see how much storage your projects have used during the selected time period.

### SQL Editor [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size\#sql-editor)

Since we designed Storage to work as an integrated part of your Postgres database on Supabase, you can query information about your Storage objects in the `storage` schema.
