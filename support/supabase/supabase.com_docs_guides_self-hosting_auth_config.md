# Auth Self-hosting Config

* * *

In a self-hosted environment, you do not have access to the Auth configuration such as third party OAuth provider settings through the Supabase dashboard. Instead, you configure them through the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can read more about the configuration in the [Self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#configuring-services).

You can find the complete list of available configuration parameters on the README of the [Auth repository](https://github.com/supabase/auth?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).
