# AWS Marketplace

* * *

You can purchase Supabase through the AWS Marketplace. Buying through AWS Marketplace can mean simpler billing, faster progress toward your AWS spend commitments, and centralized purchasing across all your AWS accounts. Start the purchase process from our marketplace [product page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zjciuce2qsb3q).

When you make a purchase on AWS Marketplace, AWS will calculate sales taxes, VAT, GST, service tax, etc. (“Indirect Taxes”), if applicable, based on the location of your AWS account. You can find more details in the [AWS tax help guide](https://aws.amazon.com/tax-help/marketplace-buyers/).
