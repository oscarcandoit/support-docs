# Backups Release Notes

Validated on 1 Oct 2025

## October 2025

### 1 October

- Now in public preview, you can [customize a usage-based backup plan](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/backups/how-to/enable/) for regular and GPU Droplets. This plan’s cost is based on the amount of storage your backups use, instead of a flat percentage of the Droplet’s cost. Additionally, you can configure how often backups happen and for how long you retain them.

- Backups now remain available for four weeks even if the associated Droplet is deleted. Previously, deleting a Droplet would also delete its backups.

You can view your backups and their expiration dates in the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/images/backups) and [convert them to snapshots](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/backups/how-to/convert-to-snapshot/).


## October 2018

- Droplets created from [custom images](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/custom-images/) now support snapshots and backups.


## June 2018

### 11 June

- Expanded Droplet View allows customers using the Dashboard to click a Droplet and quickly view additional information about the Droplet without having to go to the Droplet Page. It also updates the list of Droplets to display at a glance whether Backups are on/off and if a Floating IP is attached.
