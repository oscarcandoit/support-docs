## Simple. Secure. Superfast

Publitio simplifies the delivery of your media files while maintaining full functionality and security. With Publitio, your entire end-to-end image & video process is taken care of, while giving you maximum control and flexibility over your media assets.

### CDN by default

Your files have never been closer to the user (data center locations). With 6 data centers across the globe, your files will be delivered from the nearest location to the user. Plus points go to the website performance since CDN can positively influence page speed. [Publitio CDN infrastructure explained](https://publit.io/community/blog/cdn-by-default-publitio-infrastructure-explained)

![](https://assets.publit.io/images/homepage/cdn.svg)

### Change file formats on the fly with URL-based transformations

Publitio offers a URL-based form of API through which you can do all file transformations by changing parameters in the file URL. You can use it for video conversion, to transcode your files between formats, for resizing, cropping, trimming, watermarking, and/or quality adjustment. [See URL-transformations demo](https://publit.io/demo)
