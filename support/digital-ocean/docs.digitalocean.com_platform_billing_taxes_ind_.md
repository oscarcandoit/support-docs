# India Tax Information

Validated on 29 Aug 2025 • Last edited on 28 Oct 2025

As of 1 July 2017, DigitalOcean charges Goods and Services Tax (GST) to customers with a tax location in India. The current tax rate is 18%.

This complies with the Government of India’s regulations on OIDAR services (Online Information and Database Access or Retrieval Services).

If you are a business customer of DigitalOcean with a valid GSTIN in India, you can [add it to your team](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings) to remove tax charges from your invoice, but you are still subject to the reverse charge mechanism (RCM). If you have a valid GSTIN but don’t add it to your team, your invoice includes tax charges.

If your business operates in more than one state and has more than one GST Identification Number, enter the GSTIN corresponding to your primary place of business (the GSTIN corresponding to the state where your registered office is situated).

### Tax Deduction at Source (TDS)

[Tax deduction at source (TDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_deduction_at_source) is a method of collecting income tax in India. Customers are not required to withhold tax on DigitalOcean cloud computing services under the TDS scheme. As of 1 January 2025, we do not accept Form 16A or other documentation to issue TDS credits.

DigitalOcean previously complied with TDS until [this Tribunal decision](https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/amazon-484114.pdf) determined that cloud computing services should not be taxable as royalty or Fees for Technical Services under the India-US tax treaty, making TDS not applicable. The [Dehli High Court’s May 2025 ruling](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/98835372/) reiterated that cloud computing services and other SaaS services cannot be considered as royalty or FTS under Article 12 of the India-US tax treaty.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Taxes in India

### Do invoices need to be in INR for them to be GST compliant?

No. Invoices do not have to be in INR for them to be GST compliant.

### Why is the GST breakdown missing from my invoice?

When you add your GSTIN to your team, we no longer charge GST and no longer display a breakdown on your invoice. Instead, you are responsible for paying the GST under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM).

When your team does _not_ have a GSTIN, then DigitalOcean charges the GST and your invoice includes the breakdown.

### Why doesn’t the term “reverse charge” appear on my invoice?

The services offered by DigitalOcean are OIDAR services. Unlike services offered by domestic companies, there is no fixed invoice format for OIDAR services, so the term “reverse charge” does not need to appear on your invoice for you to be responsible for paying it.

If you have not entered your GSTID into your DigitalOcean team, we charge GST and it appears on your invoice. After you update your GSTIN on your team, you are not be charged for GST; in this case, as the service recipient, you are still responsible for paying GST under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM).

### Can I claim credits for the GST I paid before I entered my GST ID?

Unfortunately, no. You cannot claim credits for the GST you paid before you added your GSTIN to your team.

From the date you add your GSTIN to your DigitalOcean team, you are not be charged for GST. As the service recipient, you are still responsible for paying GST under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM). You can offset such payments against your output liability or claim them as a refund. Check with your finance team/auditor on how to claim credits.

### Does DigitalOcean have an HSN/accounting code?

Yes. Our invoices include a service tax number for affected customers. The HSN/SAC code of the services not mentioned in the invoice is 998439, which corresponds to “Other on-line contents n.e.c.”.

### Your GST number does not look like an Indian GST. Can I still get GST credit?

DigitalOcean is a non-resident OIDAR service provider, so the format of our GST number is different than the format for resident service providers. This does not affect your ability to claim GST credits or pay the GST under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM).

## Frequently Asked Questions about Taxes

### How is my tax location determined?

Your tax location is typically based on your account address, which is initially set to the payment address of your primary payment method when you sign up. In some locations, we are required by law to consider other account details, like other payment addresses or IP addresses.

### How can I change my tax location?

You can update your account address and view your account’s tax location and rate at any time on [the **Billing** page’s **Settings** tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings). If you’ve set your account address correctly but your account’s tax location is not what you expect, [contact support for help](https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/).

### Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?

USD is the only currency we accept for payments, so all invoices are in USD. We cannot provide invoices in other currencies. [Learn more about invoices](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/invoices/)
