# Zabbix Server 6.4

Generated on 25 Apr 2023
from [the Zabbix Server 6.4 catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zabbix-server-6-4)

Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution designed to monitor and track performance and availability of network servers, devices, services and other IT resources. Zabbix is an all-in-one monitoring solution that allows users to collect, store, manage and analyze information received from IT infrastructure, as well as display on-screen, and alert by e-mail, SMS or through integration with ticketing or messaging systems when thresholds are reached. Zabbix allows administrators to recognize server and device problems within a short period of time and therefore reduces the system downtime and risk of system failure. The monitoring solution is being actively used by SMBs and large enterprises across all industries and almost in every country of the world.

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=zabbix-zabbixserver64)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Zabbix Server 6.4 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Zabbix Server 6.4 Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"zabbix-zabbixserver64"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Zabbix Server 6.4

Login in to your Zabbix server via SSH. In the prompt you should see Zabbix web interface username (Admin) and randomly generated password.

Then in a web browser go to https://YourDropletIP and login with Zabbix web interface username name and password.
