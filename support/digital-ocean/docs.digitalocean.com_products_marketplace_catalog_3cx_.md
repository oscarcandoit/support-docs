# 3CX

Generated on 14 Nov 2025
from [the 3CX catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/3cx)

3CX is a business communications solution that offers companies of all sizes with a complete package for calls, video and live chat, out of the box. With integrated video conferencing, apps for Android and iOS, website live chat, SMS, Facebook and WhatsApp messaging integration, 3CX boosts employee productivity and enhances the customer experience.

3CX is open-standards, allowing you to choose from a selection of supported IP Phones and SIP Trunks that best suit your business needs and budget. Installation, management and use of 3CX is extremely easy and straightforward saving you time on phone system management and maintenance.

Pricing is based on the number of simultaneous calls you need, not on the number of users/extensions you have, which also knocks down the cost of ownership tremendously.

Choose between 3CX Dedicated PRO or Enterprise. Both come with their set of Unified Communications features all bundled in the initial price, so there are no hidden costs and extra add-ons.

You can even try 3CX free! [https://www.3cx.com/signup/?src=domarketplace](https://www.3cx.com/signup/?src=domarketplace)

## Software Included

_This Marketplace listing does not include a detailed software list._

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=3cxcommunication-3cx)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the 3CX 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB 3CX Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"3cxcommunication-3cx"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying 3CX

To start the 3CX Installation Wizard, access the following URL after the droplet has been deployed: http:// **DROPLET\_PUBLIC\_IP**: **5015**

\*Note: For security purposes, Port 22 (SSH) is not enabled in the default firewall created by the marketplace deployment. Should you need to access your instance via SSH, make sure you allow access to Port 22 from your IP. \*
