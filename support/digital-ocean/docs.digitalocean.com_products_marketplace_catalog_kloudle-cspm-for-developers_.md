# KLOUDLE - CSPM for Developers

## Discover & Fix Security Misconfigs in your DigitalOcean Cloud

Kloudle is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for DigitalOcean. It automates cloud security for your DigitalOcean account.

Kloudle automatically figures out all that is configured in your DigitalOcean cloud account. Droplets, Kubernetes, Spaces etc. etc. Kloudle calls them assets.

It figures out whether these assets are configured correctly from a security point of view. If not it will not only tell you what can go wrong if you don’t fix it but also gives you super simple steps to fix these security issues. More commonly known as misconfigs.

![Kloudle Assets](https://imgs.kloudle.com/DigitalOcean-Marketplace/Kloudle-assets-DO.gif?w=50%25)

### Why is it useful for you

Kloudle seamlessly fuses expert security knowledge in a user-friendly design. It does all the heavy lifting in the background, turning the complex process of securing cloud accounts into a straightforward workflow.

![Misconfigs in your cloud account](https://imgs.kloudle.com/DigitalOcean-Marketplace/kloudle-misconfigs-do.gif)

It’s an invaluable asset for engineers who value their time and want to ensure robust security. With Kloudle, you can keep your focus on creating and shipping stellar features, while it takes care of keeping your cloud accounts secure.

### Built for Developers and Engineers

Kloudle is built with developers and engineers in mind. It breaks from the norm of security products, which often cater primarily to security professionals. Instead, it’s designed with a keen understanding of an engineer’s priorities—building and shipping great features. Kloudle takes over the daunting, time-consuming security tasks, so you don’t have to.

Get Started by adding Kloudle as an add-on from the DigitalOcean Marketplace

![Adding Kloudle as an add-on from the DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://imgs.kloudle.com/DigitalOcean-Marketplace/adding-kloudle-addon-digitalocean-marketplace.gif)

## How does KLOUDLE work

Kloudle requires access to your DigitalOcean account. You give read only access to Kloudle by generating a personal access token.

Once you paste the token in the Kloudle app, it gets stored in a super secure security vault.

Kloudle, using the access token, starts scanning your account using the same set of APIs that you rely on when using the DigitalOcean website or doctl command line tool.

As Kloudle fetches security relevant information about your account and its assets, it starts discovering all that is misconfigured. Kloudle then enriches this data with a severity rating to help you prioritize, clear details on what has gone wrong and what kind of business impact it can lead to. This is incredibly useful to share with other people in your team who may not be as technical as you are.

Along with this information Kloudle also compiles steps you can take to fix the misconfigs. Sometimes the steps can be executed on the DigitalOcean website and sometimes only on the command line. Needless to say Kloudle provides the steps in all possible ways.
