[Frigade](https://frigade.com/) is a developer-first platform for building quality product onboarding. A powerful, flexible API and native SDKs allow you to build onboarding 10x faster, experiment more easily, and drive customer success.

Frigade supports a series of use cases such as:

- **Registration**: Maximize the number of users getting through your sign up flows with beautiful explainers, progress bars, and forms.
- **Activation**: Convert more customers by taking them through a series of key onboarding items specific to their role, permissions, or goals.
- **Adoption**: Introduce audiences to specific features that deliver value with native hotspots, tooltips, tours, and interactive product guides.
- **Engagement**: Keep active customers engaged, announce new product features, and create lifecycle specific re-onboarding flows for dormant or churned customers.
- **Retention**: Increase retention by delivering the right content at the right time, and by asking your users for feedback on the product.
