# DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform Features

Validated on 1 Jul 2025 • Last edited on 6 Nov 2025

DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform lets you build fully-managed AI agents with knowledge bases for retrieval-augmented generation, multi-agent routing, guardrails, and more, or use serverless inference to make direct requests to popular foundation models.

Gradient AI Platform is a comprehensive suite of tools and features designed to help you build, manage, and deploy AI-powered agents. This includes a variety of foundation models to choose from and a range of features to make your agents more effective and efficient, including agent routing, knowledge bases, guardrails, and more.

## Models

Models are large language models (LLMs) trained on large datasets to perform a variety of tasks. You can choose from [multiple foundation models](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/details/models/), including commercial and open-source options, depending on your use case. These models generate responses for agents or respond directly to requests without creating an agent.

You can interact with models in the following ways:

- **[Model playground](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/getting-started/use-model-playground/)**: Test and compare model performance in a web-based interface. You can adjust settings like temperature and token limits, evaluate model responses, and fine-tune how your agents behave.

- **[Serverless Inference](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/use-serverless-inference/)**: Send API requests directly to foundation models without creating or managing an agent. Serverless inference runs requests immediately using your model access key and model ID with no need to define instructions or context ahead of time.


## RAG Pipelines and Knowledge Bases

A knowledge base is a private repository of unstructured files, folders, or web pages that enhances agent responses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). When you attach a knowledge base to an agent, it can retrieve and use relevant information even if the foundation model wasn’t originally trained on it. Knowledge bases can include documentation, FAQs, and guides to help the agent deliver more accurate, context-aware responses.

Knowledge bases store raw data in [DigitalOcean Spaces object storage](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) and index it with a [DigitalOcean OpenSearch cluster](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/opensearch/). After indexing, you can attach the knowledge base to an agent to deliver more accurate and relevant responses to user queries.

You can [upload data to knowledge bases](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-manage-agent-knowledge-bases/) from the following sources:

- [DigitalOcean Spaces buckets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/details/features/)
- Local file
- Web pages from seed URLs or sitemap URLs
- Amazon S3 buckets
- Dropbox folders

We offer different [vector embedding models](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/details/models/#embedding-models) that allow you to choose a model that best captures the context of your data. Vector embeddings models organize and find patterns in unstructured data, allowing your agents to search for content that matches the user’s input.

[Activity logs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-manage-agent-knowledge-bases/#activity) give you visibility into indexing jobs for each knowledge base. You can view recent activity and download CSVs for debugging.

[Auto-indexing](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-manage-agent-knowledge-bases/#auto-index-data-source-control-panel) automatically re-indexes changes from connected sources like Dropbox, Amazon S3, and DigitalOcean Spaces. It keeps your knowledge bases up to date without manual re-ingest or custom schedulers. You can schedule recurring indexing jobs in the control panel or via the API.

## Guardrails

[Guardrails](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/manage-agent-guardrails/#attach) scan an agent’s input and output for sensitive and inappropriate content and override the agent’s output when it detects the specified problematic content. For example, they help prevent an agent from sharing login credentials or credit card information when tuned correctly for your specific use case.

We offer the following guardrails that you can attach to your agent:

- **Sensitive Data:** Identifies and anonymizes various categories of sensitive information, including credit card numbers, personally identifiable information, and location data.

- **Jailbreak:** Helps your agent maintain proper functionality by preventing malicious inputs.

- **Content Moderation:** Controls agent output by filtering responses related to inappropriate content categories, including violence and hate, sexual content, weapons, regulated substances, self-harm, and illegal activities.


## Agents

Agents are AI-powered tools that can perform a wide range of tasks, like answering questions or generating text content. Agents can use a combination of foundation models, knowledge bases, functions, and guardrails to inform their responses to user queries.

You can interact with agents in the following ways:

- **[Agent endpoints](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/use-agents/#use-endpoint)**: Each agent has an endpoint that allows you to interact with it through an API. You can integrate endpoints into your applications, customize requests to the agent, and authenticate them using access keys.

- **[Chatbot embed](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/use-agents/#use-chatbot-interface)**: We provide a code snippet for each agent that allow you to embed a chatbot interface into your website or application.

- **[Agent playground](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/getting-started/use-model-playground/)**: We provide a web-based interface for interacting with agents, allowing you to test and refine agents.

- **[Agent Tracing](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/trace-agents/)**: View a step-by-step timeline of how your agent processes prompts, including token usage, processing time, and resource access. If you [opted into storing trace data](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/view-agent-observability/#conversation), each trace also includes the full input and output for every interaction, giving you a complete record of the conversation flow.
  - **Insights**: Analyze trace data to generate recommendations for improving efficiency and accuracy. Insights send trace data to a third-party model for processing, and you receive data-driven suggestions to reduce latency, optimize token usage, and improve agent behavior. These recommendations help you troubleshoot issues, enhance performance, and lower costs.
- **[Agent templates](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-agents/#create-an-agent-from-a-template)**: We provide templates for common use cases, such as a customer support and business analysis. Templates have predefined instructions and foundation models that allow you to quickly create an agent.


## Tool (Function) Calling

Tool (function) calling enables foundation models to interact with external tools to access real-time data, perform actions, and extend their capabilities beyond their internal knowledge. The model identifies that a user request requires external information or action, and decides which tool to use. The model doesn’t execute the tool itself. Instead, it provides the necessary parameters to the external tool using a structured request to provide the required information or perform the action. The application runs the tool, and feeds the results back to the model. The model uses this information to produce a complete response.

All commercial models from Anthropic and OpenAI available on the Gradient AI Platform support tool (function) calling.

You can also call [DigitalOcean Functions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/route-agent-functions/) from your agents to enhance agent responses with real-time or external data and get more relevant responses.

## Agent Evaluations

Agent evaluations are automated tests that can provide insight into how well your agents are responding to prompts you’ve provided. Workspaces let you run evaluations on multiple agents at once.

There are [19 evaluation metrics](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/reference/agent-evaluation-metrics/) available you can use to evaluate your agents, incluidng checking for factual correctness, instruction adherence, tone, and toxicity.

The test results are percentage pass/fail scores with visualizations so you can see your agents’ performance over time.

## Agent and Function Routing

You can use agent and function routing to create more complex and dynamic responses to user queries.

- [**Agent Routing**](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/route-agents/) directs queries to the right agent based on context.

- [**Function Routing**](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/route-agent-functions/) enhances agent responses with real-time or external data.


For example, you may have one agent to answer general travel questions and another to managing booking. Agent routing automatically sends booking-related requests to the booking agent for a more accurate response. Function routing can then call a function to retrieve weather information which the booking agent can include in its reply to provide more relevant travel recommendations.
