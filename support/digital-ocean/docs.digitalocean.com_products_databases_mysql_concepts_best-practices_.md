# Best Practices

Validated on 13 Jul 2022 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

MySQL is an open source, object-relational database built with speed and reliability in mind. Its large and active developer community has created many third-party applications, tools, and libraries that expand MySQL’s functionality.

## Use VPCs

We recommend you make full use of your DigitalOcean VPC networks to improve security, facilitate connection management, and mitigate trusted source limits. To do this, add the CIDR address of a database’s VPC network to its trusted sources. This functionally adds all other resources you have in the same VPC network to the database’s trusted sources using only one address towards the limit, as long as they connect via the private connection string, instead of the public one. The CIDR address also only counts as one trusted source IP against the 100-IP limit.

First, go to the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases) and click your database. In its **Overview** tab, find the **VPC Network** section, which details the VPC’s name (such as `default-nyc3`) and its address (such as `10.108.0.0/20`). Copy the VPC’s address with its netmask to your clipboard. For example, copy `10.108.0.0/20`.

![Copy the VPC address.](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/vpc-address.dcbc3e7ffb345b1b100e0a9c148278aab48799568a87d592fa1b3c1b3001d319.png)

Then, click the **Settings** tab. Find the **Trusted Sources** section and click **Edit** to the right of it. Paste the VPC’s address without the netmask and press Enter. Click **Save** to confirm your change.

![Add a trusted source.](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/trusted-sources.d160aa387bd895e79d0b13cfc701007609f7df56fa3f973f3727e317616a71d9.png)Warning
You currently cannot add IPv6 rules to a database cluster’s trusted sources.

Now, all other resources in that same VPC network can connect to the database by using the private connection string, instead of the public one. You can find the private connection string in the database’s **Overview** tab. Under **Connection Details** select **VPC Network**, then click the drop-down menu reading **Connection Parameters** and select **Connection String**.

![View the private connection string.](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/private-connection-string.d1ffed0237b69c0a8aaaa3bf009edb03b65ec31132d353a1a399084efc959c77.png)

For improved security, we recommend you use this private connection string whenever possible and minimize the number of public connections to the database.

To establish secure, centralized connections between resources in different VPCs or platforms, you can use a proxy server, for example [ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) or [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/).

## Add Standby Nodes

Standby nodes maintain a copy of a database cluster’s primary node. If the primary node fails, a standby node is automatically promoted to replace it. Additionally, standby nodes can direct routing for read traffic.

To add standby nodes, see [How to Add Standby Nodes](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/add-standby-nodes/).
