# Invoices

Validated on 24 Feb 2025 • Last edited on 20 May 2025

DigitalOcean billing cycles are monthly. On the first day of each month, we invoice and charge your team’s primary payment method for the previous month’s usage. If your team does not use any resources, you do not receive an invoice.

Invoices include the following information:

- Charges the team has accured in a billing cycle, like resource usage
- [Credits](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/invoices/#credits) applied to the invoice, if any
- [Purchase orders](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/invoices/#purchase-orders), if any
- Reference information, like the invoice number, payment due date, and the name and email address on the team

You can update the team information displayed on invoices on the **Billing** page’s [**Settings** tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings). Any changes you make are immediately visible on invoices you view thereafter.

## View and Download Invoices

When we create an invoice, we email a PDF of it to team members with the owner or biller role. Invoices are also available directly in the control panel, as a downloadable PDF, and as a downloadable CSV file.

On the [**Overview** tab of the **Billing** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing), your latest invoice is visible in the **Month-to-date Summary** section:

![Month-to-date Summary section](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/billing/month-to-date-summary.4b8494f586d5521a13111c58dc1442651468c671874d83bb8f26f3f7991251e4.png)

In this section, you can:

- View the invoice in your browser, and expand details on the charges by resource type and individual resource
- Download a PDF of the invoice
- Download a CSV of the invoice with a more detailed breakdown of the charges, including which project each resource belongs to

To download the PDF or CSV version of the invoice, click **Download**, then click **Download as PDF** or **Download as CSV**.

You can view past invoices in the **History** tab:

![The Billing History section of the Billing page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/billing/billing-history.1f1357ec203436aec24934c8b28fa6790af80f92a8f946a67980957f1fcc18e4.png)

Like the month-to-date summary, you can similarly view historical invoices in your browser and download the PDF or CSV versions.

### Project Spend CSV File

Note
The project spend CSV file is currently in beta and is not yet available for all accounts.

The project spend CSV file contains estimates of your team spend by project.

This CSV file shows your current spend based on your actual usage, and doesn’t include any estimates of future usage for the current billing cycle. We calculate bandwidth by taking the total bandwidth charges for your team and dividing it each project’s usage.

Click here to expand an example of bandwidth charges in the project spend CSV file.

For example, say your team has currently accrued $100 of bandwidth overage charges across the following resources:

- 50% of the bandwidth usage is from a resource in Project A.
- 25% of the bandwidth usage is from another resource in Project A.
- 25% of the bandwidth usage is from a resource in Project B.

The project spend CSV file would summarize these charges in the following way:

```
Project,    Product,    Description,        USD
Project A,  Bandwidth,  Bandwidth Overage,  $75
Project B,  Bandwidth,  Bandwidth Overage,  $25
```

You can request a project spend CSV file from the control panel. On the [**Billing** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing), in the **Month-to-date Summary** section, click **Request Project Spend CSV**. When you request a project spend CSV file, we send it to the email associated with your account.

## View Credits

When your team has credits available, like credits from a [promo code](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/promo-codes/), the [**Billing** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing) has a **Credits** section:

![The Credits section of the Billing page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/billing/credits.503d4649d759298120ae4f61e3f7546b562816b728135b46cbb68de5e2f13570.png)

This displays your team’s available credits, their expiration, and their initial and remaining amounts.

Credit information is also displayed on invoices, including the month-to-date summary.

## Create and View Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are a way to track your resource usage for your reference. When you add a purchase order to your team, that information appears on your invoices. You can also view the amounts invoiced to date and remaining against your purchase orders in the control panel.

Note
Purchase orders are for your reference, and do not function as usage or payment limits. If the full amount associated with a purchase order number is invoiced, or if the purchase order number otherwise expires or terminates, we take no action and continue to bill your primary payment method for your resource usage.

To add a purchase order to your team, on the **Billing** page, click the [**Settings** tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings). In the **Purchase Orders** section, click **Create Purchase Order**.

In the window that opens, enter the purchase order number, amount, starting date, and optionally an ending date, then click **Save**. Your team’s active purchase orders are visible in an expandable table in this section:

![The Purchase Orders section of the Billing page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/billing/purchase-orders.4c127a46ea4f3a47fdbf5a816e6117bdcd6711c6674d273a402cc8c4fca48f18.png)

To cancel a purchase order, click the **…** menu next to the order you want to cancel, then click **Cancel Purchase Order**. In the window that opens, confirm the cancellation by entering the purchase order number and clicking **Cancel Purchase Order**. Your non-active purchase orders are also visible in the **Purchase Orders** section.

## Invoice Limits

The following limits apply to invoices:

- We cannot change invoice and billing dates.

- Invoices do not reflect PayPal pre-payments or credit/debit card payments. Invoices are not receipts for any such payments.

- We bill exclusively in USD and all invoices are in USD. We do not invoice in local currency.


In addition to monthly invoice emails, you can opt into [billing alerts](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/billing-alerts/), which are emails you receive when your monthly spending exceeds a threshold you define.
