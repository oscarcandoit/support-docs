Validated on 23 Apr 2024 • Last edited on 23 Jan 2025

Paperspace Deployments are containers-as-a-service that allow you to run container images and serve machine learning models using a high-performance, low-latency service with a RESTful API.

To delete a deployment, follow these steps:

1. In the Paperspace console, select the project that contains the deployment you want to delete.

2. Click the **Deployments** tab and find the deployment you want to delete.

3. Click the **…** menu and select **Delete**.
