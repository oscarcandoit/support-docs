# Folding@home

Generated on 19 Dec 2024
from [the Folding@home catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/folding-home)

Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics.

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=sharklabs-foldinghome-18-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Folding@home 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Folding@home Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"sharklabs-foldinghome-18-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Folding@home

By default when the droplet is created, Folding@home is installed and running with the default user (Anonymous), the default team (0), at medium power, and with no passkey. To configure these parameters, ssh on to the droplet and execute the following:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/FAHClient stop
FAHClient --configure
# enter your desired configuration
# copy/merge this configuration over to /etc/fahclient/config.xml
sudo /etc/init.d/FAHClient start
```
