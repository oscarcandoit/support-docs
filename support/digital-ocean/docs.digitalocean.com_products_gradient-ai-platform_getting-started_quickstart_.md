# DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform Quickstart

Validated on 8 Jul 2025 • Last edited on 22 Aug 2025

DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform lets you build fully-managed AI agents with knowledge bases for retrieval-augmented generation, multi-agent routing, guardrails, and more, or use serverless inference to make direct requests to popular foundation models.

To get started quickly with Gradient AI Platform, we recommend the following steps. You can do follow these steps in any order, but we recommend setting up your knowledge base first, which can help inform your agent’s design.

## Create a Knowledge Base (Optional)

Knowledge bases are collections of data that contain information relevant to a specific topic or domain. They provide additional context and information to the agent’s model during the generation process. For example, you can add your company’s internal documentation to a knowledge base and then add the knowledge base to an agent.

To create a knowledge base using the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click the **Create** button, and select **Knowledge Bases**.

On the knowledge base creation page, name the knowledge base, and then click the **Select data source** button. In the **Select data source** page, you can select from the following data sources:

- **Spaces bucket**: Select this option if you want to upload files from a [DigitalOcean Spaces bucket](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/).
- **File upload**: Select this option if you want to upload files from your local machine.
- **URL for web crawling**: Select this option if you want to crawl a website and extract information from it.

After selecting a data source, select whether to store the knowledge base’s data in a new or existing [DigitalOcean Managed OpenSearch cluster](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/opensearch/).

Next, select an [embedding model](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/details/models/#embedding-models). Embedding models index the data and convert it into a numerical representation that models can use to create responses. Which embedding model you choose depends on the type of data you want to store in the knowledge base and the number of tokens you want to spend indexing the data.

Finally, select the project you want to add the knowledge base to and optionally, add tags to organize and relate resources for your knowledge base. Then, review your knowledge base configurations and the estimated cost of your knowledge base indexing job, then click **Create Knowledge Base**.

Once the knowledge base is created, you can attach it to new or existing agents.

## Create an Agent

Agents are the core resource of Gradient AI Platform and you can integrate their interfaces into your applications or website.

To create an agent using the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click **Agent Platform** in the left menu, then click **Create Agent** to open the **Create an Agent** page.

Name your agent something that explicitly defines its purpose. This is helpful if you plan to [route other agents](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/route-agents/) to this one as other agents can use this context to effectively route requests.

Specify your agent instructions. [Agent instructions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/concepts/agent-instructions/) tell your agent what you want it to do and how it should do it. You can adjust these instructions in the [agent playground](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/test-agents/) after creation. Alternatively, you can start with one of the [ready-to-use agent instruction templates](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/concepts/agent-instructions/#copyable-templates) and customize it to your needs.

Choose a model. We offer several [foundation models](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/details/models/) pre-trained on large datasets and adaptable to various tasks.

You can test and compare models in the [model playground](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/getting-started/use-model-playground/) before creating your agent. This environment allows you to evaluate performance and [adjust settings](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-agents/) like max tokens, temperature, and top-p.

Optionally, [add a knowledge base](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-manage-agent-knowledge-bases/) to enable retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for your agent. Models using RAG incorporate information from a knowledge base in addition to the original training data to produce more accurate, contextually relevant responses.

Select the project you want your agent to belong to and, optionally, add tags to organize and relate resources for your agent. Review your agent configurations and the estimated cost of your agent, then click **Create Agent**.

After creating your agent, [test its performance](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/test-agents/).

## Create Access Key

Access keys authenticate requests to an agent’s endpoint, similar to an API key. Any request from outside of DigitalOcean to an agent’s endpoint must include an access key.

To add access keys to an agent, go to the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), select the agent you want to add access keys to, and then click the **Settings** tab. In the **Endpoint Access Keys** section, click the **Create Key** button.

In the **Create Agent Access Key** window, name the access key, and then click **Create**. The access key is created and displayed in the **Endpoint Access Keys** section. Copy the access key and save it in a secure location.

## Use Agent Endpoint

[Agent access keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/use-agents/#access-key) let you authenticate to an agent’s endpoint. Each key shows its name, the agent it belongs to, and when it was created.

Once you have created an agent, you can use the agent’s endpoint to generate responses to user queries. The following cURL request and Python OpenAI examples show how to use the agent’s endpoint to generate responses to user queries. They use environment variables to store the agent’s endpoint (`$AGENT_ENDPOINT`) and access key (`$AGENT_ACCESS_KEY`).

If you want the request to return retrieval information about how the response was generated, such as the knowledge base data, guardrails, and functions used, set the `include_retrieval_info`, `include_guardrails_info`, and the `include_functions_info` parameters to `true`.

cURL example

```shell
curl -i \
  -X POST \
  $AGENT_ENDPOINT/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_ACCESS_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [\
      {\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": "What is the capital of France?"\
      }\
    ],
    "stream": false,
    "include_functions_info": false,
    "include_retrieval_info": false,
    "include_guardrails_info": false
  }'
```

Python OpenAPI example

`use-agent-endpoint-key.py`

```python
# Install OS, JSON, and OpenAI libraries.
import os
import json
from openai import OpenAI

# Set your agent endpoint and access key as environment variables in your OS.
agent_endpoint = os.getenv("agent_endpoint") + "/api/v1/"
agent_access_key = os.getenv("agent_access_key")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url = agent_endpoint,
        api_key = agent_access_key,
    )

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model = "n/a",
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you provide the name of France's capital in JSON format."}],
        extra_body = {"include_retrieval_info": True}
    )

# Prints response's content and retrieval object.
    for choice in response.choices:
        print(choice.message.content)

    response_dict = response.to_dict()

    print("\nFull retrieval object:")
    print(json.dumps(response_dict["retrieval"], indent=2))
```

## Embed a Chatbot

Embedded chatbots allows users to interact with your agent through a basic chat interface.

To embed a chatbot in your application or website, you first need to set your agent’s endpoint to be publicly accessible. To do this, go to your agent’s **Overview** page. In the **Endpoint** section, click **Edit**. In the **Set endpoint availability to public** window, select **Public**, then click **Save**.

This opens the **CHATBOT** embed code below the **ENDPOINT** section. The chatbot embed code is an HTML `<script>` element that you can copy and paste into your application or website.

## Next Steps

Once you’ve set up an agent, you can fine tune it using the following features:

- **[Agent Playground](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/test-agents/)**: Allows you to test your agent’s responses to user queries, and then adjust the model’s parameters and configuration settings.
- **[Guardrails](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/manage-agent-guardrails/#attach)**: Allows you to set rules and constraints for the agent’s responses to ensure that the agent’s responses are safe.
