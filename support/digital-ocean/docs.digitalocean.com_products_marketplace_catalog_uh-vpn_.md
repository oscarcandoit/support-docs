# UH VPN

Generated on 9 Oct 2020
from [the UH VPN catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/uh-vpn)

UH VPN is a secure, fast and easy to use VPN platform designed for individuals, groups of friends or companies. It is managed through a centralised easy to use web interface at [https://uh-vpn.com](https://uh-vpn.com/) which acts as the command and control centre for all UH VPN deployments. All changes are made via this website including server settings, authorized entities, cryptography options and more.

UH VPN comes packed with state of the art client applications on all major platforms that are free to download and use. Furthermore, VPN profile distribution is done via our unique one-time-code exchange mechanism alleviating the hassle of trying to distribute sensitive VPN profiles.

UH VPN is free for personal use but has a premium tier unlocking features such as custom app branding, advanced IP routing and cryptography options.

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the UH VPN 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB UH VPN Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"ultrahorizon-uhvpn-18-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```
