# twigs

Generated on 12 Mar 2021
from [the twigs catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/twigs)

twigs droplet is a compact linux distribution with twigs and all its dependencies in a compact image. Fire it up and discover your cloud, container, source code and many other types of assets. Report them to your ThreatWatch instance and continuously assess them for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, compliance issues, information leaks and much more.

## Software Included

_This Marketplace listing does not include a detailed software list._

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=threatwatch-twigs-20-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the twigs 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB twigs Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"threatwatch-twigs-20-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying twigs

Launch the image and access the command line over ssh. You will be prompted to setup your twigs environment i.e. authenticate your ThreatWatch credentials. You can sign up to ThreatWatch by visiting [https://threatwatch.io](https://threatwatch.io/). You may choose to set up your twigs environment later by running ’twigs login'

Refer to the twigs user guide for a complete description of all twigs options here: [https://threatwatch.io/twigs-user-guide/](https://threatwatch.io/twigs-user-guide/)
