## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=plesk-20-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Plesk 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Plesk Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"plesk-20-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Plesk

The easiest way is by using the root username and password that you define while creating a droplet.

### **To log in to Plesk for the first time using a root password:**

See the video instruction: `https://youtu.be/ZvxiBEQ1ay4`

1. Copy the droplet IPv4 address and then open the `https://your_droplet_public_ipv4` link in your browser.
2. Ignore the “Your connection is not private” warning in your browser and proceed. It is safe to do so because the connection to your Plesk server is actually secure and encrypted with a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate.
3. On the Plesk login page, specify the root username, the root password you have created earlier, and then click **Log in**.
4. You will be redirected to the Plesk welcome screen. Follow the instructions on this screen and then click **Enter Plesk** to log in to Plesk.

**Note:** If you log in to a Plesk instance that is still being deployed, you will see the maintenance screen. Once the deployment is finished, the maintenance screen will be gone and you will be able to start using Plesk.

You can also [log in to Plesk using SSH keys](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/deployment-guide/plesk-installation-and-upgrade-on-public-cloud-services/installing-plesk-on-digitalocean.79699/#accessing-plesk-for-the-first-time) if you have chosen this way when creating a droplet.

### Next steps

Your Plesk is completely ready to work and you can start adding your first domain. However, we recommend that you also make the following steps:

- [Set up DNS hosting in DigitalOcean DNS](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/deployment-guide/plesk-installation-and-upgrade-on-public-cloud-services/installing-plesk-on-digitalocean.79699/#setting-up-dns-hosting).
- [Assign a floating IP address to your droplet](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/deployment-guide/plesk-installation-and-upgrade-on-public-cloud-services/installing-plesk-on-digitalocean.79699/#assigning-floating-ip-addresses).
