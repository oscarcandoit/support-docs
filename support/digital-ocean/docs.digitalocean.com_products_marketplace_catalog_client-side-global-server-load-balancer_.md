from [the Client-side Global Server Load Balancer catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/cs-gslb)

**EASY DEPLOYMENT**

Deploy your application in 3 easy steps by using the DynConD Client-side Global Server Load Balancer!

1. Sign up and register on the user portal my.dyncond.com

2. Add all your servers

3. Implement the DynConD library into your application and you are ready to go!


**UNPARALLELED USER EXPERIENCE**

Deliver a high quality, smooth and uninterrupted user experience by using the fastest GSLB solution on the market.

DynConD uses its proprietary Client-side GSLB method, a real-time Dynamic Server Selection calculation process that will ensure your end-users will always have the lowest possible latency and will enjoy using your application!

DynConD’s service will ensure that your application is available at all times, even if one of your servers or server clusters goes down, your application will still be available to all your users.

**EASE OF USE**

Control all your servers through the central DynConD user portal. Add more or remove servers as you require with just a few clicks, track their status, and get notified if one of them is down!

**HOW DOES THE SERVICE WORK?**

The Client-side GSLB collects and measures real-time data about actual network distance, service response time, and current server load and makes the decision about which particular server is optimal for each user. This is the new, modern, and more efficient way of load balancing and doesn’t rely on outdated methods or geographical approximation. The technical workings of the Client-side Global Server Load Balancer are explained in great detail on the company website [www.dyncond.com](http://www.dyncond.com/).

**OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOR MULTI-CLOUD AND HYBRID CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE**

Tired of overpaying for expensive cloud services, but are afraid to make the switch? DynConD’s Client-side GSLB now enables customers to make the transition to a multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environment in a few simple and easy steps, totally stress-free!

**GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT**

In case of any issues, the support team is available via email, WhatsApp, phone, or video chat. Special Teamviewer/AnyDesk sessions can be scheduled in case of implementation difficulties.
