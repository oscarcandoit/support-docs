# Projects Quickstart

Validated on 5 Apr 2024 • Last edited on 18 Apr 2024

Projects let you organize your DigitalOcean resources into groups that fit the way you work. Create projects that align with the applications, environments, and clients that you host on DigitalOcean.

All of your DigitalOcean resources start in a single default project. You can move resources between projects in bulk or one at a time, and you can populate new projects when you create them.

To create a new project from the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), in the left menu, click **\+ New Project**. There are two steps:

1. Create the project. Fill out a name, description, and purpose for the project, then click **Create Project**.

2. Move resources into the project. Type in the text box to search for existing resources, or click **Skip for now** to add resources later.


You can switch between projects by clicking the project name in the left menu. You can move resources into a project by clicking the **Move Resources** button in the top right. Moving a resource removes it from its original project and adds it to a different project.

[Project-based resources](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/#resources) must belong to a project. To remove it, you can either destroy the resource or move it to a different project.

The default project appears at the top of the **Projects** list in the main menu. To set a different project as default, in the left menu, click the project’s name. Click the **Settings** tab, then check the box next to **This is my default project** and click **Save**.

You can delete a project that has no resources and is not the default project on the same **Settings** tab.
