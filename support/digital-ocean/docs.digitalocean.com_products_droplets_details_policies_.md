# Droplet Policies

Validated on 23 Jan 2019 • Last edited on 3 Jun 2025

DigitalOcean Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.

## Droplet Access

Droplets are completely unmanaged; DigitalOcean does not have direct access to user Droplets. If you experience issues with your Droplet, you can [open a support ticket for help](https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/), but our support team members still cannot access your Droplets directly.

## Droplet Passwords

If you choose not to use SSH keys for authentication when you create a Droplet, you must create a root password. If you lose or forget the root password, you can [reset your Droplet’s root password via the control panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/how-do-i-reset-my-droplets-root-password/).

## Tor Relays

If you are running a Tor service, you are responsible for the sub-users that connect to it. There is no way to tell the difference between abuse from a user and abuse from sub-users, so malicious activity from your sub-users flags your account. This can lead to us suspending your account and destroying your Droplets.

Because of the risk to your account, we do not recommend running open services where any user can connect. While we do not restrict the software you choose to install, you are responsible for how it is used and how freely available you make the service.

## Tor Exit Nodes

We do not specifically disallow Tor exit nodes, but as the account holder, you are responsible for all the traffic going through your Droplet (including traffic that an exit node may generate), and we do prohibit some of the traffic types that may go through a typical Tor exit node.

If you are unable to stop prohibited traffic like torrents, spam, SSH probes, botnets, and DDoS attacks, running a Tor exit node may lead to us suspending or terminating your account. We send you an email in the event of a violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms/), and you must address these issues as soon as possible.
