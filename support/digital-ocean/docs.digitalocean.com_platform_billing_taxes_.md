## Frequently Asked Questions about Taxes

### How is my tax location determined?

Your tax location is typically based on your account address, which is initially set to the payment address of your primary payment method when you sign up. In some locations, we are required by law to consider other account details, like other payment addresses or IP addresses.

### How can I change my tax location?

You can update your account address and view your account’s tax location and rate at any time on [the **Billing** page’s **Settings** tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings). If you’ve set your account address correctly but your account’s tax location is not what you expect, [contact support for help](https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/).

### Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?

USD is the only currency we accept for payments, so all invoices are in USD. We cannot provide invoices in other currencies. [Learn more about invoices](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/invoices/)
