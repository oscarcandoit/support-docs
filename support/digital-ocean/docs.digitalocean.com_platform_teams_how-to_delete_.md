# How to Delete Teams

Validated on 15 May 2024 • Last edited on 18 Mar 2025

Deleting a team permanently removes it from the control panel.

## Prerequisites

To delete a team that you own, you must first destroy all [Droplets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/destroy/), [Spaces buckets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/destroy/), [DigitalOcean Managed Databases](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/how-to/destroy/), and [DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/destroy-clusters/) on the team.

Once these resources are destroyed, owners can delete a team to remove it from the control panel. We automatically destroy the following resources when a team is destroyed: App Platform apps, volumes, DOCR container registries, snapshots, custom images, domains and PTR records, reserved IPs, load balancers, VPCs, firewall rules, alert policies, SSH keys, SSL certificates, projects, personal access tokens, Spaces access keys, OAuth applications, external app authorizations, and security history.

Deleting a team removes all team members from the team but does not deactivate any individual accounts.

## Delete a Team

Once a team has no blocking resources (Droplets, Spaces, DigitalOcean Managed Databases, and DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters), an owner can delete it.

To delete a team, you need to switch to that team. Click the account drop-down in the top right of the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), then click **Switch Teams** and click the team that you want to delete.

Next, click **Settings** in the left menu to go to the main [**Team** settings tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/team).

![The Team tab](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/teams/profile-tab.4e338296520f1d85ed0b83f7abece59e6311788b3fd753cedf3ee30204f92e78.png)

Click **Edit Information**. In the **Edit Team Profile** window that opens, click **Delete team**.

![The Edit Team Profile window](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/teams/edit-team-profile.f0f88b9f547bb0092eb276658c1a4ca6bd2219be6ebdf2286f70d467d02f8b99.png)

Confirm the deletion by clicking **Yes, Permanently Delete \[Team Name\]**.

When you confirm the deletion, owners receive an email confirmation that the team has been deleted and the team no longer appears in the control panel. The payment method associated with the team is charged for the team’s final balance, and billers and owners on the team receive the receipt for the final charge.

Once a team is deleted, you can reuse the name for a new team.
