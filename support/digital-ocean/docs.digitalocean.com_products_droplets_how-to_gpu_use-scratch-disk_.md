# How to Use the Scratch Disk on DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI GPU Droplets

Validated on 21 Mar 2025 • Last edited on 15 Aug 2025

DigitalOcean Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.

Like CPU Droplets, all GPU Droplets have a _boot disk_, which is a local, persistent disk on the Droplet to store data for software like the operating system and ML frameworks.

Additionally, some GPU Droplets have a _scratch disk_, a local, non-persistent disk to store data for staging purposes, like inference and training. The scratch disk is not included in snapshots of the Droplet, and if you destroy or recreate a GPU Droplet, the scratch disk is lost. The scratch disk has no redundancy, so hardware failures may also lead to loss of data.

We strongly recommend storing data you want to keep on the boot disk, and using the scratch disk for ephemeral data as intended.

## Configure Automatic Mounting

The scratch disk that comes with a GPU Droplet is pre-formatted with a single ext4 GPT partition, but it is not automatically mounted.

To configure automatic mounting, first create a mount point directory (like `/scratch`):

```shell
mkdir /scratch
```

Then add the following configuration to `/etc/fstab`:

```
LABEL=DOSCRATCH	/scratch	ext4	discard,errors=remount-ro	0 2
```

Replace `/scratch` with the mount point directory you chose.

Finally, mount the scratch disk’s filesystem to make it available to the Droplet.

```shell
mount /scratch
```

Our [existing documentation for working with block storage volumes](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/how-to/) can be helpful for reformatting and partitioning, expanding partitions, and other block storage actions.
