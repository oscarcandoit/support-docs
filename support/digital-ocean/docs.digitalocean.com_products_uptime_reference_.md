# Uptime Reference

Validated on 21 Jun 2024 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

DigitalOcean Uptime is a monitoring service that checks the health of any URL or IP address. Use Uptime to monitor the latency, uptime, and SSL certificates of any website or host, and receive email or Slack alerts at thresholds you choose.

## Additional Tools for Uptime

### The DigitalOcean API

The [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/) lets you manage resources programmatically with standard HTTP requests. All actions available in the control panel are also available through the API.

To create, edit, delete, and list Uptime checks and alerts via the DigitalOcean API, see the [Uptime section of our API reference](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Uptime).

### The DigitalOcean Command Line Client, doctl

[`doctl`](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) is the command-line interface for the DigitalOcean API. It supports most of the same actions available in the API and DigitalOcean Control Panel.

To create, edit, delete, and list Uptime checks and alerts with `doctl`, see the [Uptime section of our `doctl` command reference](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/monitoring/uptime/).
