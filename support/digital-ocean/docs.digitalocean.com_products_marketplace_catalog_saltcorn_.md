# Saltcorn

Saltcorn is the easiest way to build web and mobile applications with a wide range of functionality, from customer relationship and project management to niche social networks. Create your database, forms and views of tables, and pages with our point-and-click, drag-and-drop user interface without writing a single line of code. Saltcorn takes care of the front-end, the back-end and all the between-ends in one open-source platform

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=saltcorn-20-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Saltcorn 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Saltcorn Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"saltcorn-20-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Saltcorn

After launching your droplet, navigate to http://your\_droplet\_public\_ipv4 in your browser where you will be prompted to create the first user. This account will have administrative privileges. You may have to wait a few seconds after droplet creation before the droplet will connect.

When you first login, go to Settings->About application->System to upgrade to the latest version of Saltcorn.

You can enable HTTPS encryption in the settings when you have associated a domain with your droplet.

Multitenancy can be enabled in the site identity settings.
