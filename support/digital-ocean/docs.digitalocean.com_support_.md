How do I generate my app's SSL certificate?

App Platform automatically generates and issues the SSL certificate during the configuration.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why am I receiving 520 status codes from my app?

Your app may have crashed while trying to receive an upload or return a response larger than it has been configured to manage.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why am I receiving a forbidden error when making changes to my App Platform app?

Your team balance may be past due. Pay your balance to lift restrictions on actions you can take on the platform.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Where can I find the client IP address of a request connecting to my app?

You can find the client IP address of a request connecting to your app in the `do-connecting-ip` HTTP header.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my app's database connection timing out?

Timeouts can be caused by high CPU utilization, so check your app’s CPU utilization and consider scaling your app.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why can't I route traffic to my app's dedicated egress IP address?

Dedicated egress IPs route egress (outbound) traffic from an app. To route ingress (inbound) traffic to an app, use one of App Platform’s public ingress IPs.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why doesn't my app's wildcard subdomain work?

Add the root domain to the list of domains in the app’s settings along with the wildcard subdomain.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my app not resolving .gov domains?

App Platform apps may be slow or unable to resolve `.gov` domains because the domain administrators have blocked DigitalOcean’s IP addresses. To fix this, you can contact the domain administrator or use a custom DNS resolver.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why can't I find my app even after paying my past due balance?

My PHP app is timing out and throwing 5xx errors

Increase your app’s maximum execution time in its .user.ini file to give it more time to complete requests.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my domain pointing to my old static site app?

Remove the domain from the old app before deleting the old app, or wait 24 hours for the DNS to update.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why am I receiving a "user does not exist" error when building my Docker app on App Platform?

In your Dockerfile, the `USER` instruction needs to be after the `FROM` and `WORKDIR` instructions.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why am I receiving an "invalid dockerfile\_path" error when building my Docker app on App Platform?

Ensure your Dockerfile’s path is correctly defined using the `dockerfile_path` parameter in your app spec file.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why are there multiple 408 errors in App Platform's runtime logs?

Multiple 408 errors are often caused by your app sending health checks with very short timeouts to App Platform. They typically don’t affect the functionality of the app.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my App Platform build or deployment failing with an out of memory error?

App Platform builds have a fixed amount of memory available, so try optimizing your builds to stay within the 8 GB limit. You can increase the amount of memory in App Platform deployments by upgrading to a different plan.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I back up my dev database on App Platform?

Why am I receiving “1001 DNS Resolution Error” when accessing my app's subdomain?

You need to explicitly add the subdomain in your app’s settings.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I stop, pause, or disable my app on App Platform?

You cannot pause, stop, or disable an app. You can delete the app and re-create it when needed.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why are my App Platform environment variables not updating?

Component-level variables override app-level variables, so you may have defined environment variables at both levels.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why does my app fail to build while trying to connect to a DigitalOcean Managed Database?

App Platform does not support connecting to DigitalOcean Managed Databases during the build process if the database has trusted sources enabled.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I back up my app on App Platform?

App Platform does not support backups, but you can use DigitalOcean Managed Databases to back up your data.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

What region is my app's dev database located in and can I change it?

Dev databases are located in the same region as your app and cannot be migrated to another region.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why are large files failing to upload to my app on App Platform?

Your upload may be exceeding your app’s allotted file storage space or it could be timing out.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why does my app have a US-based IP address when I created it in a different region?

You see the CDN load balancer’s IP address. Use `dig` to see the dynamic IP address of the app.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why does my app keep restarting on App Platform?

Application crashes, high memory consumption, and high disk usage are usually responsible for apps restarting.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I add an A record to my app on App Platform?

Apps do not have static IP addresses so you cannot point an A record at an app.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why can't I access my environment variables at build time when building from a Dockerfile on App Platform?

Environment variables are only available as build-args for Dockerfile builds in App Platform.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I change my app's GitHub repository on App Platform?

You can change an app’s source repository by updating the app’s spec.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why am I receiving a missing module error when building my Node.js app on App Platform ?

Ensure the missing module is listed in the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I inject certificates or other files into my app at build time?

App Platform does not currently support injecting values as files on disk. Use environment variables to create files at run time.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

My app failed to build and I received an exit code

How to Troubleshoot Apps in App Platform

Review some common troubleshooting techniques for App Platform.

## Backups

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I restore individual files or directories from a snapshot or a backup?

The only way to restore files from an image is to recreate a Droplet or volume from the image and copy the flies from there.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I change my Droplet's backup schedule and frequency?

Yes, you can choose between daily and weekly backups and customize the backup window.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How can I destroy my Droplets while maintaining my backups?

Convert your backups to snapshots to save them indefinitely.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I download a backup or snapshot?

You cannot currently download DigitalOcean backups or snapshots, but you can use third-party tools to save your data locally.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How long will my backup or snapshot take to complete?

Creating a backup or snapshot takes roughly 2 minutes per GB of used space.

## Bare Metal GPUs

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I make BIOS-level changes to bare metal GPUs?

You can submit a support ticket to request a change in the BIOS.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is a speed test for my bare metal GPU showing slower network speeds?

Public speed test servers may not accurately reflect network performance in data center environments. We recommend using tools like `iperf` for end-to-end tests.

## Billing

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why do I need to enter a payment method?

We use payment information to verify your identity, which allows us to keep DigitalOcean safe against spammers and bots.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why does DigitalOcean require prepayment for PayPal?

When you connect PayPal as a payment method, the small prepayment verifies your account.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I have a refund?

We do not offer refunds.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I prepay for my support plans?

No, you cannot prepay for DigitalOcean support plans.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why don't I see Apple Pay as a payment option?

Apple Pay is available on the Safari browser. Try these troubleshooting steps if Apple Pay isn’t visible on your account.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why don't I see Google Pay as a payment option?

Google Pay is available on Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. Sometimes there are issues with password managers like 1Password. Try these troubleshooting steps if Google Pay isn’t visible on your account.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

I don't recognize a charge on my invoice

Download the CSV version of your invoice for more detailed billing information.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

What if I'm unable to pay my invoice?

We do not offer extensions, but we can help you find other solutions.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I update my contact and company details on my invoice?

You can edit your personal account settings on the **My Account** page. You can edit your team settings on the **Settings** page. You can update your billing address, tax location, or add a tax ID on the **Billing Settings** page.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why was my card declined?

Your card may be declined for a number of reasons, including banking restrictions, unavailable funds, or trying to use a prepaid card.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

I've paid my bill so why aren't my services online?

Once you pay a past-due balance, you need to manually turn your resources (like Droplets) back on using the control panel.

## Reserved IPs

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I use my Droplet's IP as a Reserved IP?

You cannot convert a Droplet IP address into a Reserved IP.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I preserve my Droplet's IPv4 address when I transfer the Droplet?

You cannot retain a Droplet’s IPv4 when you transfer the Droplet to a new region. Use a reserved IP address to maintain a static IP address.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I choose my Droplet's IP address?

You cannot create Droplets with a specific IP address, but you can use reserved IPs for a static address that you can migrate between Droplets.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I get a Droplet's dedicated IP address?

Droplets do not have a dedicated IP address, but you can create a Reserved IP, which is a reassignable static IP address.

## SnapShooter

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

I got a Permission Denied error when running a SnapShooter backup.

Either remount the tmp folder with exec permissions or set the backup engine to use the home directory instead.

## Snapshots

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I restore individual files or directories from a snapshot or a backup?

The only way to restore files from an image is to recreate a Droplet or volume from the image and copy the flies from there.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why can't I create a Droplet from a snapshot?

You cannot create Droplets in certain datacenters due to limited capacity. If you have snapshots in a limited capacity datacenter, transfer them to another datacenter to create Droplets from them.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I downsize a Droplet using a snapshot?

You cannot downsize a Droplet from a snapshot. Data is not always stored sequentially in memory, so reducing the size of a disk can result in data loss or corruption.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my snapshot's size different from reported disk usage?

Snapshots of Droplets are a best estimate based on the disk usage. Snapshots of volumes operate at the block storage level, so the snapshot size may not match what the filesystem reports.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I fix a "The resource you were accessing could not be found" error when restoring a Droplet from a snapshot?

This error happens when the Droplet you’re trying to restore no longer exists, so try creating a new Droplet from the snapshot instead.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Do snapshots retain the IP address of the Droplet they were created from?

No, but you can use reserved IPs to assign the same address to new or redeployed Droplets.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I download a backup or snapshot?

You cannot currently download DigitalOcean backups or snapshots, but you can use third-party tools to save your data locally.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How long will my backup or snapshot take to complete?

Creating a backup or snapshot takes roughly 2 minutes per GB of used space.

## Spaces

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I back up Spaces buckets?

Create another bucket to transfer data to, save your files locally, or use an automatic backup tool.

## Teams

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Do paid DigitalOcean support plans support multiple teams?

No, each team needs their own plan.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I transfer a domain between teams?

We do not support directly transferring domain ownership from one team to another. Instead, you can download a zone file with all of the domain’s DNS information.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my account now a team?

Team collaboration is built into the DigitalOcean experience from sign-up.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I transfer a Droplet to someone else?

You can transfer snapshots of Droplets to others by email address or by team.

## Third-Party Applications

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How can I renew Let's Encrypt certificates?

You can renew your certificate manually using Certbot.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I install cPanel or WHM on my Droplet?

You can install cPanel and WHM on AlmaLinux, Rocky, and Ubuntu Droplets.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I use Windows on a Droplet?

No, we do not provide Windows images for Droplets or support Windows custom images.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I have more than one WordPress instance installed?

Yes, you can serve multiple WordPress instances from a single Droplet.

## Volumes

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I attach a volume to multiple Droplets?

No, but you can mount a remote filesystem on a Droplet with the volume attached using software like SSHFS or NFS.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why does my Droplet show almost 100% disk usage even after attaching a new volume?

Adding a volume to your Droplet doesn’t increase its main disk size. You need to resize the Droplet to increase its main disk size.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why is my resized volume smaller than I expected?

Filesystem tools often don’t report the capacity reserved for metadata and the root user, and some report size in different units.

## VPC

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I add an old Droplet to a VPC without changing its IP address?

Older Droplets that did not have VPC enabled prior to October 2020 cannot be added to a VPC network without changing its IP address.
