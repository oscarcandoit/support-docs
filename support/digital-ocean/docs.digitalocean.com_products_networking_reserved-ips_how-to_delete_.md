# How to Delete Reserved IPs

Validated on 17 Jun 2025 • Last edited on 18 Sep 2025

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Assign and reassign reserved IP addresses to Droplets as needed, or implement an automated failover mechanism with reserved IPs to build a high availability infrastructure.

Deleting a reserved IP unassigns it and permanently removes it from your account.

## Delete an Assigned IP Using Automation

How to Delete a Reserved IPv4 Using the DigitalOcean CLI

1. [Install `doctl`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/), the official DigitalOcean CLI.
2. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and save it for use with `doctl`.
3. Use the token to grant `doctl` access to your DigitalOcean account.




```shell
doctl auth init
```

4. Finally, run `doctl compute reserved-ip delete`. Basic usage looks like this, but you can [read the usage docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/compute/reserved-ip/delete/) for more details:




```shell
doctl compute reserved-ip delete <reserved-ip> [flags]
```



The following example deletes the reserved IP address `203.0.113.25`:




```shell
doctl compute reserved-ip delete 203.0.113.25
```


How to Delete a Reserved IPv4 Using the DigitalOcean API

1. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and save it for use with the API.
2. Send a DELETE request to [`https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/reserved_ips/{reserved_ip}`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean//#operation/reservedIPs_delete).

### cURL

Using cURL:

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/reserved_ips/45.55.96.47"
```

### Go

Using [Godo](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo), the official DigitalOcean API client for Go:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "os"

    "github.com/digitalocean/godo"
)

func main() {
    token := os.Getenv("DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN")

    client := godo.NewFromToken(token)
    ctx := context.TODO()

    _, err := client.ReservedIPs.Delete(ctx, "45.55.96.34")
}
```

### Ruby

Using [DropletKit](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet_kit), the official DigitalOcean API client for Ruby:

```ruby
require 'droplet_kit'
token = ENV['DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN']
client = DropletKit::Client.new(access_token: token)

client.reserved_ips.delete(ip: '45.55.96.47')
```

### Python

Using [PyDo](https://github.com/digitalocean/pydo), the official DigitalOcean API client for Python:

```python
import os
from pydo import Client

client = Client(token=os.environ.get("DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN"))

resp = client.reserved_ips.delete(reserved_ip="45.55.96.47")
```

How to Delete a Reserved IPv6 Using the DigitalOcean CLI

1. [Install `doctl`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/), the official DigitalOcean CLI.
2. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and save it for use with `doctl`.
3. Use the token to grant `doctl` access to your DigitalOcean account.




```shell
doctl auth init
```

4. Finally, run `doctl compute reserved-ipv6 delete`. Basic usage looks like this, but you can [read the usage docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/compute/reserved-ipv6/delete/) for more details:




```shell
doctl compute reserved-ipv6 delete <reserved-ipv6> [flags]
```



The following example deletes the reserved IPv6 address `5a11:a:b0a7`:




```shell
doctl compute reserved-ipv6 delete 5a11:a:b0a7
```


How to Delete a Reserved IPv6 Using the DigitalOcean API

1. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and save it for use with the API.
2. Send a DELETE request to [`https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/reserved_ipv6/{reserved_ip}`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean//#operation/%25!s(%3Cnil%3E)).

## Delete an Assigned IP Using the Control Panel

To delete a reserved IP from the [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click **Networking** in the main menu, then click the **Reserved IPs** tab. Open the **More** menu of the reserved IP you want to delete, then click **Delete**.

![Reserved IP with more menu open](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/reserved-ips/reserved-ips-assign.e365e5a632472195d6c8a090d17fe4f959e2f0f21477a0a99574174560ffc3e0.png)

In the confirmation window, click **Delete Reserved IP** to perform the deletion.
