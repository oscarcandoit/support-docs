# DigitalOcean Teams

Validated on 14 Aug 2024 • Last edited on 30 Sep 2025

On DigitalOcean, you manage your infrastructure and billing with teams. You can group related teams into [organizations](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/organizations/) for consolidated billing, payment, and invoicing. Your [personal account](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/accounts/) lets you manage your team membership and your name, sign-in method, and email subscriptions.

When you sign up for DigitalOcean, you are the only member of your default team. You can always work by yourself on a team of one.

You can also collaborate with others by inviting them to teams you own. Teams are available at no cost and you can create multiple teams with any number of team members. Each team is billed separately and has its own payment information.

Team Roles

Each team member has a role which determines their permissions on the team. Permissions grant varying levels of access to the team’s shared resources, billing information, and settings.
