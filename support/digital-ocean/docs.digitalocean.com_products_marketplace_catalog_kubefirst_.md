# kubefirst

Generated on 28 May 2024
from [the kubefirst catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/kubefirst)

Kubefirst is a free, fully automated, and instantly operational open source platform that includes some of the most popular open source tools available in the Kubernetes space, all working together in a click.

By running our installer in your cloud, you’ll get a GitOps cloud management, cluster management, and application delivery ecosystem complete with automated Terraform workflows, Vault secrets management, GitLab or GitHub integrations with Argo, Single Sign On for your team, and a demo application that demonstrates how it all pieces together.

## Software Included

_This Marketplace listing does not include a detailed software list._

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to install a Kubernetes 1-Click Application. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters/new?addonslug=kubefirst&nodePools=s-1vcpu-2gb%3A3)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating kubefirst using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 3 node DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster made up of Basic Droplets in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `doctl` command. You need to authenticate with `doctl` with your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and replace the `$CLUSTER_NAME` variable with the chosen name for your cluster in the command below.

```shell
doctl kubernetes clusters create --size s-4vcpu-8gb $CLUSTER_NAME --1-clicks kubefirst
```

## Getting Started After Deploying kubefirst

## kubefirst

Kubefirst delivers instant GitOps platforms so you can have the most popular open source platform tools working together in minutes.

### Access your console

```
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <your cluster name>
kubectl --namespace kubefirst port-forward svc/kubefirst-console 8080:8080
```

visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
