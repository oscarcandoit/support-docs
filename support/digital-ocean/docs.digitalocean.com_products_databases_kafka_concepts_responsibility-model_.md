# Shared Responsibility Model

Validated on 5 Jan 2023 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

Kafka is an open-source distributed event and stream-processing platform built to process demanding real-time data feeds. It is inherently scalable, with high throughput and availability.

As a managed service provider, DigitalOcean provides stability and security to your database clusters. However, some best practices for database management still fall under the user’s responsibility. For example, while DigitalOcean takes full responsibility for hosting physical infrastructure and ensuring network security, users are responsible for managing client-side encryption, the database firewall, and access to data.

To ensure the security of your database clusters, the following shared responsibility model describes exactly which operations and security measures users are responsible for and which DigitalOcean is responsible for:

| User’s Responsibilities | DigitalOcean’s Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Manage users and their permissions | Ensure physical security of servers and OS |
| Control network access through trusted sources | Provide backup and recovery options (PITR, restore from backup, fork databases) |
| Monitor database performance by creating alert policies | Monitoring via health checkups and auditing database logs |
| Add high availability and scalability | Provide standby and read-only nodes, automated failover |
| Protect cluster’s data (unauthorized access, data validation) | Encrypt data at rest (LUKS) and in transit (SSL) |
| Optimize databases and queries | Provide data durability and redundancy |
| Change variables via the DO API | Restart databases |
|  |  |
