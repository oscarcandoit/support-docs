# Custom Images

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

Custom images are Linux and Unix-like images you import to DigitalOcean. You can create Droplets based custom images, which lets you migrate and scale your workloads without spending time recreating your environment from scratch.

## Latest Updates

### 1 July 2022

- The following pricing changes are now in effect:


  - A new $4 Droplet with 512MB of memory, 10GB of storage, 1 vCPU, and 500GB of outbound data transfer is now available in NYC1, FRA1, SFO3, SGP1, and AMS3. The slug is `s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb`.

  - We have simplified pricing for DigitalOcean Kubernetes and some managed databases for better accuracy and predictibility.

  - The prices of Droplets, Snapshots, Load Balancers, Reserved IPs, and Custom Images have increased.


There is no change to pricing for Spaces, backups, volumes, DigitalOcean Container Registry, or App Platform. There are also no changes to inbound data transfer or bandwidth pricing.

This is our first major price change in 10 years, and we believe the new model better fits our understanding of our customers and the expanded breadth of our offerings. For a more detailed breakdown of the changes, see [our blog post on our new pricing](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/new-4-dollar-droplet-updated-pricing).

### 31 August 2021

- You can now assign [floating IP addresses](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/) to Droplets that use [custom images](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/custom-images/).


### 11 March 2020

- Users can now [upload custom images](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/custom-images/how-to/upload/) using FTP URLs.
