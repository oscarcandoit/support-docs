# How to Manage DigitalOcean Personal Account Settings

Validated on 14 May 2024 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

Note
DigitalOcean's terms of service prohibit accounts registered to addresses from OFAC-sanctioned countries. For more information, including a list of countries, see section 5.7 of our **Rules of Conduct** in [our terms of service](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/).

On your [**My Account** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/profile), you can edit account information and settings, like your name, password, sign-in method, two-factor authentication, team membership, and email subscriptions.

To access your account settings from the control panel, click the profile icon in the top right:

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/accounts/profile-icon-menu.d9516ea95d5d74421e062e35c0036b1cc93671e20207676320f4a03c7ccac58f.png)

In the menu that opens, click **My Account** to go to your [**My Account** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/profile).

## Name

At the top of the **Profile** tab, the **Name** section displays the name on your account. Click the **Edit** button to change it.

## Sign-in Method

The **Sign-in method** section lets you choose how you log in to your DigitalOcean account. You can use:

- Email and password
- Google SSO
- GitHub SSO

To change from one sign-in method to another, click **Change** to open the drop-down menu and select the option you want to use.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/accounts/profile/sign-in-method.86fcaf4619de22f2ba338ed7fdeff59959ad6a8a60816e74127c2982eddca705.png)

### Email Address and Password

If you currently use email and password to sign in, you can choose **Update email address** to change your email address.

Enter your new email address into **Enter new email address** field. Then enter your current password into **Confirm password** field to confirm the change. Click **Update** to submit the change.

We send a confirmation email to your new email address to finalize the change. The change does not take effect until you click the link in the confirmation email.

For security reasons, we don’t display your password here. Click **Reset Password** to change your password. If you don’t remember your current password, after clicking **Reset Password**, you can click **Reset Via Email**.

If you’re using an email and password to log in to DigitalOcean, the **Two-factor authentication** section lets you enable or disable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/accounts/2fa/). 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to provide a code along with your username and password when you log in.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/accounts.svg)

How to Manage Two-Factor Authentication for DigitalOcean Accounts

Use 2FA to add an additional layer of security against unauthorized access to your DigitalOcean account.

### Google or GitHub Accounts

If you currently sign in with a Google or GitHub account, the account email address is displayed in the **Sign-in method** section.

To switch to another account with the same provider, you need to switch to a different login option and then switch back to select a different account.

Note
To use GitHub SSO, the email addresses on your GitHub account and your DigitalOcean account must match. If you change your GitHub email address before changing your DigitalOcean email address first, you cannot use GitHub to log in to DigitalOcean.

When using Google or GitHub to sign into DigitalOcean, we strongly recommend that you enable two-factor authentication on your [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9096865) or [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) account.

## Email Preferences

The **Email subscriptions** section includes a link to the [Subscriptions Preference Center](https://anchor.digitalocean.com/Email_Preferences.html), which lets you opt in or out of the emails you receive from us.

## Your Teams

The **Your teams** section lists any [DigitalOcean Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/) you are part of. The team **name**, your **role** (member, biller, or owner), **status** (invited or joined), and join date (if applicable) are listed here.

![The Your Teams section of the Profile page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/accounts/profile/your-teams.92c0b10cf68898965b822e3a4219a129c7254b886d76ce3a232cd24074df5dc7.png)

The **…** menu next to each team has several options:

- **Go to team** switches to the team account and returns you to the control panel.
- If you are a team owner, **Manage team settings** takes you to the team settings page.
- If you are a team owner or biller, **Manage billing** takes you to the team billing page.
- **Leave team** opens a window to confirm that you want to leave the team. If you are the last owner on a team, leaving the team deletes the team and charges the payment method associated with the team for the team’s final balance.

You can also **Create a Team** in this section.

## Deactivate Account

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/accounts.svg)

How to Deactivate DigitalOcean Accounts and Purge Account Data

Deactivate an account to stop billing and prohibit future resource creation. Optionally purge your account data to permanently remove the account from DigitalOcean and prevent account reactivation.

The **Deactivate Account** section allows you to deactivate your account and purge all of your account data, including email addresses and payment information.

![The Deactivate Account section of the Profile page.](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/accounts/profile/deactivate-account-section.9c7b816fc3407a2e01ef31820f167d13ab360a853fa5ba679a7a127d4697cdf7.png)

Before you deactivate your account, you must delete or transfer ownership of any teams your team you own and resolve any outstanding bills.
