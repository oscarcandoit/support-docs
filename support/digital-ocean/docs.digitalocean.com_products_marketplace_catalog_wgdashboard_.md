## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the WGDashboard 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB WGDashboard Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"wgdashboard"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying WGDashboard

Once you installed:

1. `ssh root@your_droplet_public_ipv4`
2. Enter `sudo systemctl status wg-dashboard.service` to check the status
3. If you see the service is **Active**, use your browser to visit `http://your_droplet_public_ipv4:10086`
4. Once you finished the welcome session, you should see a pre-defined configuration `wg0` is ready for you. You’ll just need to add peers, download it to your device and enjoy!
