The [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/) is the home for Droplet 1-Click Apps, Kubernetes 1-Click Apps, SaaS Add-Ons, and 1-Click Models from DigitalOcean and third-party vendors.

Marketplace has several offerings:

Droplet 1-Click Apps are pre-built Droplet images that come with preconfigured software, features, and settings.

DigitalOcean Marketplace Kubernetes 1-Click Apps

Kubernetes 1-Click Apps are pre-configured applications for Kubernetes with software, features, and configuration details already in place.

DigitalOcean Marketplace SaaS Add-Ons

SaaS Add-Ons are third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings provided by external vendors.

DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI 1-Click Models

1-Click Models let you deploy third-party generative AI models on [DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI GPU Droplets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/gpu/) with no additional setup or configuration.

You can explore the available offerings in the [Marketplace catalog](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/), which includes documentation, package versions, initial setup, and API creation instructions.

DigitalOcean Marketplace Catalog

Launch services, tools, and components without manual configuration using Marketplace offerings.

When an app is supported by DigitalOcean, DigitalOcean actively updates and maintains it. Apps supported by SharkLabs are experimental and may not be actively maintained or updated. We convert popular SharkLabs apps into DigitalOcean apps. Apps that are not supported by DigitalOcean or SharkLabs are maintained by the app’s third-party vendor.

## For Vendors

If you’d like to bring your app, tool, or service to our community, [learn more about becoming a Vendor](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/vendors/getting-started-as-a-digitalocean-marketplace-vendor). Once you create your listing, developers and teams can discover your product in our catalog and quickly deploy it from our Cloud Control Panel and API.
