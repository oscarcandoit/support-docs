# Yacht

Generated on 19 Feb 2021
from [the Yacht catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/yacht)

**Keep in mind, this is still in alpha and is not recommended for production use yet**

A web interface for managing docker containers with an emphasis on templating to provide easy deployments. The goal of Yacht is to make docker easy for anyone to use and manage. Templates, template variables, and an intuitive UI make that goal possible.

## Software Included

| Yacht | [v0.0.4-hf1](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht/releases/tag/v0.0.4-hf1) | [MIT](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht/blob/master/LICENSE.md) |
| Docker CE | [19.0.3.13](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v19.03.13) | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/blob/master/LICENSE) |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=selfhostedpro-yacht-20-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Yacht 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Yacht Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"selfhostedpro-yacht-20-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Yacht

Once your droplet is created Yacht will be available at `http://your_droplet_public_ipv4:8000`

The default username is [admin@yacht.local](mailto:admin@yacht.local). The default password is `pass`. Please change it as soon as you’ve logged in using the user menu available by clicking your username in the top right.
