# DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI 1-Click Models

Validated on 25 Oct 2024 • Last edited on 15 Aug 2025

1-Click Models let you deploy third-party generative AI models on [DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI GPU Droplets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/gpu/) with no additional setup or configuration.

1-Click Models are optimized to run on GPU Droplets, and they’re pre-configured to eliminate the need for additional setup. You can deploy popular models like Meta LLama 3 and Mistral directly on GPU Droplets and start querying model endpoints immediately after provisioning.

To create a GPU Droplet using a 1-Click Model, click the **Create Droplet** button on any Marketplace 1-Click Model page. View the full list of 1-Click Models in the Marketplace catalog:
