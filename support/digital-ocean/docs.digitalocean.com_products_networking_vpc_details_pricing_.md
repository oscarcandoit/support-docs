# VPC Pricing

Validated on 19 Nov 2025 • Last edited on 19 Nov 2025

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network interface for collections of DigitalOcean resources. VPC networks are inaccessible from the public internet and other VPC networks, and traffic on them doesn’t count against bandwidth usage. You can link VPC networks to each other using VPC peering connections.

## VPC Networks

Network traffic is free within a VPC network or between peered VPC networks in the same datacenter.

## VPC Peering

Bandwidth between peered VPC networks in two different datacenters costs $0.01 per GiB.

## VPC NAT Gateway

NAT Gateways cost $40.00 per month per increment of size.

Each increment provides 25 Mbps of symmetrical bandwidth and includes 100 GiB of outbound data transfer per month. Inbound data transfer is free.

Outbound data transfer beyond the included amount costs $0.01 per GiB. When multiple NAT gateways are in the same team account, their outbound data transfer is combined into a single pool. Any existing Droplet data transfer allotment does not apply to traffic through NAT gateways.

## Partner Network Connect

Partner attachments are billed based on the selected maximum bandwidth. There is no additional cost for data transfer:

| Maximum bandwidth | Price per month |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Gbps | $840 |
| 2 Gbps | $1540 |
| 5 Gbps | $2520 |
| 10 Gbps | $3850 |

Megaport also charges for any infrastructure you create on their side of the connection. Refer to the Megaport documentation for [MCR Pricing and Contract Terms](https://docs.megaport.com/finance/mcr-pricing/) and [Megaport Internet Pricing and Contract Terms](https://docs.megaport.com/finance/megaport-internet-pricing/) for details.
