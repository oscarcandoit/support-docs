# How to Connect to MySQL Database Clusters

Validated on 19 Aug 2020 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

MySQL is an open source, object-relational database built with speed and reliability in mind. Its large and active developer community has created many third-party applications, tools, and libraries that expand MySQL’s functionality.

You can connect to DigitalOcean Managed Databases using command line tools and other third-party clients. This guide explains where to find your MySQL database’s connection details and how to use them to configure tools and clients.

## Retrieve Database Connection Details Using the CLI

How to Retrieve Database Connection Details Using the DigitalOcean CLI

1. [Install `doctl`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/), the official DigitalOcean CLI.
2. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and save it for use with `doctl`.
3. Use the token to grant `doctl` access to your DigitalOcean account.




```shell
doctl auth init
```

4. Finally, run `doctl databases connection`. Basic usage looks like this, but you can [read the usage docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/databases/connection/) for more details:




```shell
doctl databases connection <database-cluster-id> [flags]
```



The following example retrieves the connection details for a database cluster with the ID `f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6`:




```shell
doctl databases connection f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
```


## Retrieve Database Connection Details Using the API

This API call retrieves the information about your database, including its connection details. The connection details are located in the returned `connection` JSON object.

How to Retrieve Database Connection Details Using the DigitalOcean API

1. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and save it for use with the API.
2. Send a GET request to [`https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/databases/{database_cluster_uuid}`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean//#operation/databases_get_cluster).

### cURL

Using cURL:

```shell
curl -X GET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/databases/9cc10173-e9ea-4176-9dbc-a4cee4c4ff30"
```

### Go

Using [Godo](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo), the official DigitalOcean API client for Go:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "os"

    "github.com/digitalocean/godo"
)

func main() {
    token := os.Getenv("DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN")

    client := godo.NewFromToken(token)
    ctx := context.TODO()

    cluster, _, err := client.Databases.Get(ctx, "9cc10173-e9ea-4176-9dbc-a4cee4c4ff30")
}
```

### Python

Using [PyDo](https://github.com/digitalocean/pydo), the official DigitalOcean API client for Python:

```python
import os
from pydo import Client

client = Client(token=os.environ.get("DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN"))

get_resp = client.databases.get_cluster(database_cluster_uuid="a7a89a")
```

## View MySQL Cluster Connection Details

You use your database’s connection details to configure tools, applications, and resources that connect to the database. To view your database’s connection details, click the name of the cluster on [the Databases page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases) to go to its **Overview** page.

![Databases Overview screen showing connection string](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/connection-details.b18206f6861c63d5a396b1c98934b93c5588ce48c46b27582d6f20337d848ccd.png)

You can view customized connection details based on how you want to connect to the database:

- **Public network** and **Private network** ( [VPC](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/)) options generate connection details based on if you want to connect via the cluster’s public hostname or the cluster’s private hostname. Only other resources in the same VPC network as the cluster can access it using its private hostname.

- The **Database** field updates the connection details based on which database you want to connect to.

- The **User** field updates the connection details with the [user credentials](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/manage-users-and-databases/) that you would like to connect with.


You can also choose to view the connection details in three different formats:

- **Connection parameters:** Database information meant for application configuration, such as configuring connections for MySQL Workbench and Sequel Ace.

- **Connection string:** A condensed string that you can pass to a client on the command line.

- **Flags:** A complete `mysql` command that supplies the connection variables as individual flags.


We recommend the flags format because the readability can help if you want to customize the way you connect. The only required parameter is `sslmode`, but MySQL supports many [options for customizing connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-command-options.html).

By default, the control panel doesn’t reveal the cluster’s password for security reasons. Click **Copy** to copy connection details with the password, or click **show-password** to reveal the password.

## Anatomy of the Flags Format

The connection string passes different parameters to MySQL via **Flags**. Here’s a high-level breakdown of what information those flags correspond to:

- **Hostname and Port**:
The hostname is specified with the `-h` flag, and tells your client computer how to reach the cluster. Port is specified with the `-P` flag (notice it’s upper case). If you do not specify a port, the client will attempt to use the default MySQL port, `3306`.

- **Username and Password**:
The username and password are specified with the `-u` flag for user and the `-p` flag for password. By default your database has only one accessible user, `doadmin`. If you leave the `-p` flag blank, you will be prompted for the user’s password.

- **Database**:
The database is specified with the `-D` flag (notice it’s upper case), this tells the MySQL client which database you want to access.

- **Other Flags**:
You can find a more comprehensive list of the flags you can pass to the MySQL command on the official documentation for MySQL at [`mysql` Client Options](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html).


## Download the SSL Encryption

Each managed database comes with an SSL certificate. You can use this SSL certificate to encrypt connections between your client applications and the database.

To download your database’s SSL certificate, click the name of the cluster on [the Databases page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases) to go to its **Overview** page. In the **Connection Details** section, click **Download CA certificate**.

![Databases connection details with Download CA Certificate selected](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/dbaas-ssl-certificate.8b2c955e8e43aa8e36b56bc98564bd42da5a9ba716eff506e1c174ca2d678d47.png)

When you configure your client applications, you can use the certificate’s location on your local system. Each client application is configured differently, so check the documentation for the tool you’re using for more detail on setting up SSL connections.

## Connect to the Database

You can connect and manage the database using a command line tool or an application that has a graphic user interface (GUI). In this guide, we show you how to connect to the database using the command line tools, `mysql` and MySQL Shell (`mysqlsh`), and the visual database management application, MySQL Workbench.

`mysql` is an SQL shell with input line editing capabilities, while MySQL Shell has more advanced features, like X DevAPI integration and multi-connection support.

Connect Using mysql

To connect to MySQL database clusters using `mysql`, you need three things:

- To add your local computer [to the database’s trusted sources](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/secure/#firewalls).

- To install the MySQL client on your local computer. We recommend either [MySQL version 8 or greater](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-latest-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04), which lets you use the `mysql` command in a terminal.


Note
MySQL 5.x clients, such as Sequel Pro, are not compatible with the higher password encryption requirements of MySQL 8.x. You can [change the password encryption](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/manage-users-and-databases/#password-encryption) of your database’s users if you are receiving [authentication errors](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/how-do-i-fix-the-authentication-error-when-connecting-to-mysql/).

- To reference the [database cluster’s connection details](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/connect/#connection-details), which tells your client how to connect to the cluster.

To connect using the flags format with `mysql` using the `doadmin` user, paste the entire command from the control panel into your terminal:

```bash
$ mysql -u doadmin -p<your_password> -h mysql-test-do-user-4915853-0.db.ondigitalocean.com -P 25060 -D defaultdb
```

You can also leave the password out when using the above commands and you will be prompted to enter it before you can connect.

To connect using [the database’s SSL certificate](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/connect/#download-the-ssl-certificate), update the flags commands with the `--ssl-ca` flag and the path to the certificate on your local system:

```shell
mysql -u doadmin -p<your_password> -h mysql-test-do-user-4915853-0.db.ondigitalocean.com -P 25060 -D defaultdb --ssl-ca=path/to/your-ssl.crt
```

When you successfully connect, the shell displays some information about the MySQL server and your prompt changes. Successful `mysql` connections look like this:

Successful connection with mysql

```shell

```

Once you’re connected, you can manage your MySQL databases via command line. The [official MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) includes a guide to MySQL commands.

If you’re having trouble connecting to the database, you can [troubleshoot the connection using our Support page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/mysql/), or you can reference [MySQL’s connection documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connecting.html).

Connect Using MySQL Shell

To connect to MySQL database clusters using MySQL Shell, you need three things:

- To add your local computer [to the database’s trusted sources](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/secure/#firewalls).

- [To install the MySQL Shell client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html) on your local computer, which lets you use the `mysqlsh` command in a terminal.


Note
MySQL 5.x clients, such as Sequel Pro, are not compatible with the higher password encryption requirements of MySQL 8.x. You can [change the password encryption](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/manage-users-and-databases/#password-encryption) of your database’s users if you are receiving [authentication errors](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/how-do-i-fix-the-authentication-error-when-connecting-to-mysql/).

- To reference the **[database cluster’s connection details](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/connect/#connection-details)**, which tells your client how to connect to the cluster.

To connect with `mysqlsh` using the flags format, paste the entire flags command from the control panel into your terminal and replace the first term, `mysql`, with `mysqlsh`:

```bash
$ mysqlsh -u doadmin -p<your_password> -h mysql-test-do-user-4915853-0.db.ondigitalocean.com -P 25060 -D defaultdb
```

You can also leave the password out when using the above commands and you will be prompted to enter it before you can connect.

To connect using [the database’s SSL certificate](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/connect/#download-the-ssl-certificate), update the flags commands with the `--ssl-ca` flag and the path to the certificate on your local system:

```shell
mysqlsh -u doadmin -p<your_password> -h mysql-test-do-user-4915853-0.db.ondigitalocean.com -P 25060 -D defaultdb --ssl-ca=path/to/your-ssl.crt
```

When you successfully connect, the shell displays some information about the MySQL server and your prompt changes. Successful `mysqlsh` connections look like this:

Connect with MySQL Workbench

To connect to MySQL database clusters using MySQL Workbench, you need three things:

- To add your local computer [to the database’s trusted sources](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/secure/#firewalls).

- [To install the MySQL Workbench client](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) on your local computer.


Note
MySQL 5.x clients, such as Sequel Pro, are not compatible with the higher password encryption requirements of MySQL 8.x. You can [change the password encryption](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/manage-users-and-databases/#password-encryption) of your database’s users if you are receiving [authentication errors](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/how-do-i-fix-the-authentication-error-when-connecting-to-mysql/).

- To reference the **[database cluster’s connection details](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/connect/#connection-details)**, which tells your client how to connect to the cluster.

To connect to your MySQL database using a standard TCP/IP connection, open MySQL Workbench, then click the **Database** drop-down menu and select **Manage Connections…**. Click **New** in the Manage Server Connections window.

In the Manage Server Connections window, create a descriptive name for the connection in the **Connection Name** field, and then select the **Standard (TCP/IP)** option from the **Connection Method** drop-down menu.
