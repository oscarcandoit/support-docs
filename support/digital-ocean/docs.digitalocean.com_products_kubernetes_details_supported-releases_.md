# DigitalOcean Kubernetes Supported Releases

Validated on 25 Mar 2021 • Last edited on 19 Nov 2025

DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) is a Kubernetes service with a fully managed control plane, high availability, and autoscaling. DOKS integrates with standard Kubernetes toolchains and DigitalOcean’s load balancers, volumes, CPU and GPU Droplets, API, and CLI.

This section outlines DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) release process and when we end support for unsupported upstream Kubernetes releases. You can find version availability and deprecation announcements in the Kubernetes [changelog](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/details/changelog/) and [release notes](https://docs.digitalocean.com/release-notes/kubernetes/).

We release new minor versions of DOKS as soon as possible (usually a month) after an upstream Kubernetes release. We release new patch versions of DOKS, which integrate new upstream patches as well as improvements to DOKS-specific components, about once a month. When an upstream Kubernetes release becomes unsupported, we stop updating the DOKS patch releases for that release.

Currently, you can create new clusters on the three most recent minor releases. In addition, you can keep existing clusters on older minor releases and apply patch upgrades to them.

## Supported Releases Policy

Our supported releases policy helps you take advantage of the latest upstream Kubernetes features and bug fixes as well as helps us provide better support and security.

- We enforce upgrades for clusters that are on unsupported releases.

Clusters are upgraded using [the upgrade process](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/upgrade-cluster/) and follow the [end-of-support timeline](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/details/supported-releases/#end-of-support-timeline). During their scheduled maintenance windows, they are automatically upgraded to the next minor release 30 days after the release they are running becomes unsupported. You can manually trigger an update at any time before or during this window. You receive notification emails 30 days, 7 days, and a day before an automatic upgrade.

We automatically upgrade clusters running on unsupported versions to the next minor release 30 days after the release they are running becomes unsupported regardless of whether you have enabled auto upgrades for those clusters.

- We provide [support](https://www.digitalocean.com/company/contact/support) for clusters running unsupported releases during the 30-day window on a best-effort basis.

- If a serious security vulnerability is identified in the version your cluster is running, we may end support for that patch version and schedule an upgrade to the latest patch version of the cluster’s current minor version. We notify you at least 7 days before the upgrade, as well as the day before the upgrade starts.

- You can continue to create new clusters on any currently-supported Kubernetes minor release. When a release goes beyond its support window, we immediately disable creation of new clusters on that release.


## End-of-Support Timeline

The following table shows the end-of-support timeline for all DOKS releases that are currently in use. The table follows the [upstream end of maintenance support](https://endoflife.date/kubernetes).
