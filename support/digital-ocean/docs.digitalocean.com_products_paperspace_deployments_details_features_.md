# Deployments Features

Validated on 14 Dec 2023 • Last edited on 13 Feb 2024

Paperspace Deployments are containers-as-a-service that allow you to run container images and serve machine learning models using a high-performance, low-latency service with a RESTful API.

Gradient Deployments are containers-as-a-service which let you deploy your machine learning model as an API endpoint.

With Deployments, you can:

- Train a model using pre-configured templates and sample projects.

- Schedule jobs, provision resources, and manage clusters with managing the servers.

- Scale up training with GPUs with no runtime limits.

- Automatically tag and version your models and compare performance over time.

- Collaborate with teams and leverage publicly-available projects.
