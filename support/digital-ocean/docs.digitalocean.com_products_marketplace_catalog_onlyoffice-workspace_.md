# ONLYOFFICE Workspace

Generated on 13 Mar 2024
from [the ONLYOFFICE Workspace catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/onlyoffice-workspace)

ONLYOFFICE Workspace is a bundle of web apps designed to handle multiple processes: document editing and real-time co-authoring, managing files, projects, customers, mail and calendars, building diversified communication hub.

Powerful ONLYOFFICE Docs for text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations are highly compatible with .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx files. Other popular formats such as .doc, .odt, .rtf, .txt, .pdf, .xls, .ods, .csv, .ppt, .odp, etc. are also supported. You are able to edit complex docs using multiple styling and formatting tools, e.g. shapes, charts, Text Art, drop caps, footnotes, bookmarks, mirror and gutter margins, and more. The pre-installed plugin set as well as the possibility to add your own plugins allows you to implement extra functionality.

You can read and annotate PDF files, create and fill out PDF forms.

With multiple collaborative features you can work on the same document together with your teammates: real-time and paragraph-locking co-editing modes, track changes, comments, built-in chat, version history.

Various productivity tools such as mail, projects, CRM, multi-format media player, Gantt chart, time tracking, reports, calendar, chat, blogs, forums, polls, and others ensure greater team workflow.

With a wide range of security tools and services like data encryption at rest and in transit, 2FA, SSO, activity tracking, audit reporting, flexible access rights management, etc., your data is kept safe on all fronts.

The package also includes an intuitive control panel for easy configuration and customization of your workspace.

The multitenancy option allows creating a separate workspace for each branch or department. With customization options, you can choose modules and tools you need, apply the color style and add your logo to fit your corporate brand. Integration with various third-party services of your choice (e.g. Google, Dropbox, DocuSign, Twilio, WordPress, etc.) allows creating a cross-functional working environment that meets all of your needs.

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=ascensiosystem-onlyoffice-18-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the ONLYOFFICE Workspace 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB ONLYOFFICE Workspace Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"ascensiosystem-onlyoffice-18-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying ONLYOFFICE Workspace

After you create your ONLYOFFICE One-Click Droplet:

- Briefly visit the Droplet via SSH `ssh root@My_Droplet_IP` to finalize the configuration.
- Then visit `http://My\_Droplet\_IP` in the browser and launch your new ONLYOFFICE portal.

For additional information on configuring, operating, and updating ONLYOFFICE Workspace Community Edition, please refer to the official [Help Center](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/workspace-community-index.aspx).

Support for the free community version is provided via the [User Forum](https://forum.onlyoffice.com/). If you need additional paid support, please [send your re quest](mailto:sales@onlyoffice.com).
