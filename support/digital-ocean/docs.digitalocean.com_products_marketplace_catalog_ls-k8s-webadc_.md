# ls-k8s-webadc

Generated on 18 May 2023
from [the ls-k8s-webadc catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ls-k8s-webadc)

LiteSpeed WebADC in Kubernetes is a Load Balancer and Ingress controller. It uses the best of both Kubernetes and LiteSpeed to provide Load Balancing and backend support with high performance and outstanding features. Unlike other Load Balancers, the LiteSpeed WebADC controller does not require internal resets. Instead, it uses its ZeroConf update feature for dynamic updates of Ingress resources, changed secrets and the like, resulting in maximum uptime, performance and reliability.

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to install a Kubernetes 1-Click Application. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters/new?addonslug=ls-k8s-webadc&nodePools=s-1vcpu-2gb%3A3)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating ls-k8s-webadc using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 3 node DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster made up of Basic Droplets in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `doctl` command. You need to authenticate with `doctl` with your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and replace the `$CLUSTER_NAME` variable with the chosen name for your cluster in the command below.

```shell
doctl kubernetes clusters create --size s-4vcpu-8gb $CLUSTER_NAME --1-clicks ls-k8s-webadc
```

## Getting Started After Deploying ls-k8s-webadc

Installation is via helm and is intended to be 1-click. The documentation is here: [https://github.com/litespeedtech/helm-chart/blob/main/helm-chart-sources/ls-k8s-webadc/README.md](https://github.com/litespeedtech/helm-chart/blob/main/helm-chart-sources/ls-k8s-webadc/README.md)
