# Custom Images Pricing

Validated on 25 Sep 2018 • Last edited on 8 May 2024

Custom images are Linux and Unix-like images you import to DigitalOcean. You can create Droplets based custom images, which lets you migrate and scale your workloads without spending time recreating your environment from scratch.

Custom images are free to upload and charged at $0.06 per GB per month to store. There is no additional charge to add an image to additional regions.

When you create Droplets from a custom image, pricing is based on the Droplet price with no additional fees.
