# Reference for App Specification

Validated on 6 Oct 2020 • Last edited on 9 Sep 2025

App Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to publish code directly to DigitalOcean servers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

As an alternative to configuring your app in the control panel, you can define an [application specification](https://docs.digitalocean.com/glossary/app-spec/)
using YAML. YAML-based app specs are useful for deploying fully-configured apps with the [DigitalOcean API or `doctl`, the DigitalOcean command-line tool](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/).

## Example App Spec

This example app spec defines a single service, `api`, and a single static site, `website`. A CORS exception is defined for `internal.example-app.com`, and an alert is triggered in the event of deployment failure.

When writing your app spec, reference \[Supported Buildpacks\] for your `environment_slug` and [App Platform pricing](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/details/pricing/#current-plans) for your `instance_size_slug`.

A working example app spec

```yaml
alerts:
- rule: DEPLOYMENT_FAILED
- rule: DOMAIN_FAILED
features:
- buildpack-stack=ubuntu-22
ingress:
  rules:
  - component:
      name: api
    match:
      path:
        prefix: /api
  - component:
      name: website
    cors:
      allow_origins:
      - prefix: https://internal.example-app.com
    match:
      path:
        prefix: /
name: your-app
region: nyc
services:
- environment_slug: go
  github:
    branch: main
    deploy_on_push: true
    repo: git-user-name/api
  http_port: 8080
  instance_count: 2
  instance_size_slug: apps-s-1vcpu-1gb
  name: api
  run_command: bin/api
  source_dir: /
static_sites:
- environment_slug: html
  github:
    branch: master
    deploy_on_push: true
    repo: git-user-name/website
  name: website
  source_dir: /
```

## YAML File Structure

This reference covers all possible values that can be defined in an app spec. Whitespace defines hierarchy in YAML files, so this reference uses whitespace to nest child values under parent values. Where the string `(array)` appears, you can define more than one of the child values, but you must prefix them with a `-` dash as shown, per YAML syntax.
