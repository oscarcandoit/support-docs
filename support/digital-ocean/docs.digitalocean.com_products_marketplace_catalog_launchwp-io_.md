## Creating Your LaunchWP Droplet

03. Next, you should arrive on the Create Droplets screen. You should select a region that is closest to the majority of your audience.
04. You can skip the Choose an image section, as the LaunchWP image should already be selected.
05. You can skip the Additional Storage section.
06. Under Choose Authentication Method, we recommend the SSH Key option as it’s the most secure.
07. We recommend you select the Add improved metrics monitoring and alerting (free) option, as DigitalOcean’s built-in monitoring tools come in very handy.
08. Expand Advanced Options and select Enable IPv6 (free) if you’d like to enable IPv6.
09. The rest of the options can be ignored. Click Create Droplet.

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the LaunchWP.io 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB LaunchWP.io Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"launchwp-launchwpio"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying LaunchWP.io

After your LaunchWP Droplet has been successfully deployed, you’ll want to SSH into the server using the root user and SSH key or password you provided when configuring the droplet:

**ssh root@your\_droplet\_public\_ipv4**

Once you can login, you can now proceed to connect it to LaunchWP. To connect your DigitalOcean droplet to LaunchWP, you would need the Droplet IP address, the SSH Port (Which is 22 by default), the Username (Which should be ‘root’), and the SSH Key File or the Root Password, whichever you used when creating the droplet.

Log in to your [LaunchWP Server dashboard](https://app.launchwp.io/) and navigate under Servers > Add Server. You need to fill out the fields with the necessary information:

**Provider name** – Just an identifier for yourself. Doesn’t matter for connection.

**IP address** – The IP address of your Server.

**Port number** – The Port for connecting via SSH. Default 22.

**SSH username** – The SSH username for connecting. Heavily recommended to connect via ‘root‘

**Authentication method** – Enter your Password or connect via the SSH Key command.

SSH login using password authentication is the easiest way, but if that’s disabled, you will need to SSH into the server and paste the given command in your terminal, and hit Enter. Hit Connect Server. For specific documentation regarding any specific providers, check out our [documentation](https://launchwp.io/docs) or our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LaunchWP), there might be the perfect steps you are searching for.

Congratulations! You’re all set to create your first site with LaunchWP. Our [Getting Started](https://launchwp.io/docs/install-wordpress-on-any-vps-with-launchwp/) doc will show you how to add a new site to your server.
