# OriginTrail DKG mainnet node

Generated on 15 Sep 2023
from [the OriginTrail DKG mainnet node catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/origintrail-dkg-mainnet-node)

## **Introduction to OriginTrail:**

OriginTrail is an open, decentralized two-layer system synergizing blockchains (OriginTrail consensus layer comprised of multiple blockchains) and knowledge graph technology (OriginTrail Decentralized Network layer). The OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) is a permissionless peer-to-peer network of OriginTrail Nodes, coordinated according to the OriginTrail protocol, implemented via its integrated blockchains.

The ODN hosts the [OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)](https://docs.origintrail.io/general/dkgintro), composed of an interconnected network of Knowledge Assets which can be created by anyone without permission, owned and marketed, discovered and verified for information provenance. More information on OriginTrail can be found on the official website [https://origintrail.io](https://origintrail.io/).

## **OriginTrail Decentralized Network mainnet node:**

**OriginTrail DKG mainnet node** operates on the **OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN)**. Anyone can run an OriginTrail node and become part of the ODN, contributing to the network capacity and hosting the OriginTrail DKG. The OriginTrail node is the ultimate data service for data and knowledge intensive Web3 applications and is used as the key backbone for trusted AI applications (see [https://chatdkg.ai](https://chatdkg.ai/)).

As a developer using the OriginTrail DKG node you can create and maintain Knowledge Asset graphs - queryable, verifiable data structures based on standardized technologies such as **W3C RDF/SPARQL**, **JSON-LD**, **DID**, **Verifiable Credentials** and thus compatible with various other **W3C** and **GS1** standards.

Anyone with sufficient technical capacity can operate an OriginTrail DKG node and thus contribute to the network, providing services according to the OriginTrail Protocol in return for service compensation in [TRAC tokens](https://origintrail.io/technology/trac-token) (read more about TRAC tokenomics in the [OT-RFC-14](https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-14-dkg-v6-trac-tokenomics-886ff2b6b8cb)).

## Software Included

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph node | 6 |  |
| MySQL | 8 |  |
| Node.js | 16 |  |
| Blazegraph | 2.1.6 |  |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=origintrail-origintraildkgma)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the OriginTrail DKG mainnet node 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB OriginTrail DKG mainnet node Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"origintrail-origintraildkgma"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying OriginTrail DKG mainnet node

After successfully deploying the OriginTrail DKG node via DigitalOcean marketplace, a few additional preparations are needed before starting your node:

1. Preparing keys (wallets) for your OriginTrail DKG node
2. Configuring and starting your OriginTrail DKG node
3. Setting up [Houston](https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/node-setup-instructions/houston-v6-node-command-center) (node command center) and configuring your node tokenomics settings (service ask and deployed stake)

## **OriginTrail DKG Node wallets preparation:**

To execute the wallet preparation, please follow the instructions available on this [link](https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/node-setup-instructions/installation-prerequisites#1.-node-wallets).

## **Configuring and starting your OriginTrail DKG node:**

Add previously prepared wallets into the configuration file (.origintrail\_noderc) which is located at the **“root/ot-node”**:

```
"sharesTokenSymbol": "<myExampleNode01>",
"sharesTokenName": "<My example node 01>",
"evmOperationalWalletPublicKey": "",
"evmOperationalWalletPrivateKey": "",
"evmManagementWalletPrivateKey": "",
"evmManagementWalletPublicKey": ""
```

Note: _You are free to define any name and the tokenSymbol for your node and add them to the **“sharesTokenSymbol”** and **“sharesTokenName”** placeholders._

**Starting your node:**

- Start your node by executing: **otnode-start** or **systemctl start otnode.service**
- Check your node logs: **otnode-logs** or **journalctl -u otnode –output cat -f**

## **Setting up Houston (node control center) and configuring ASK and STAKE:**

After your node is successfully started, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/node-setup-instructions/dkg-node-installation-instructions#1.4-setup-finalization-setting-the-node-stake-and-service-ask-parameters) in order to configure Houston control center, STAKE and ASK.
