# Reserved IP Features

Validated on 18 Sep 2025 • Last edited on 18 Sep 2025

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Assign and reassign reserved IP addresses to Droplets as needed, or implement an automated failover mechanism with reserved IPs to build a high availability infrastructure.

Reserved IPs let you redirect network traffic between any of your Droplets within the same datacenter. Assigning a reserved IP to a Droplet doesn’t replace or change its original public IP address.

You can use reserved IPs to create server infrastructures without single points of failure, but a reserved IP alone does not automatically provide high availability. For a setup to be highly available, you need to implement a failover mechanism to automate the process of detecting failures of the active server and reassigning the reserved IP to a passive server.

For example, you can assign a reserved IP to a Droplet that is running a web application. You can then write a script that uses the [DigitalOcean Monitoring API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Monitoring) to monitor the Droplet’s performance and then reassign the IP address to a backup Droplet ( [using the API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Reserved-IPs)) if the original Droplet’s performance becomes unstable or poor.

## Bring Your Own IP

Bring your own IP (BYOIP) lets you provision your own IPv4 network prefixes to your account, then assign those IPs to your DigitalOcean resources. BYOIP supports the following features:

- IPv4 addresses
- Network sizes of anywhere from `/24` (256 addresses) to `/18` (16,384 addresses)
- Same API and management interface as our existing reserved IPs feature
- Assignable to Droplets only
