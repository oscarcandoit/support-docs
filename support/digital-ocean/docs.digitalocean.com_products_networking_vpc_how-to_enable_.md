# How to Enable VPC Networking on Existing Droplets

Validated on 30 Jun 2021 • Last edited on 17 Apr 2025

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network interface for collections of DigitalOcean resources. VPC networks are inaccessible from the public internet and other VPC networks, and traffic on them doesn’t count against bandwidth usage. You can link VPC networks to each other using VPC peering connections.

Note
All DigitalOcean Droplets, Kubernetes clusters, managed databases, and load balancers created after 1 October 2020 are automatically added to a VPC network (either the account’s default network or a user-created network).

If you enabled VPC networking on your Droplet before 1 October 2020 but didn’t configure the Droplet’s private network interface, use this guide to configure the network interface necessary for the Droplet to communicate with the region’s default VPC network.

You can also [migrate the Droplet into any specified VPC network using a snapshot](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/how-to/migrate-resources/). We do not support VPC networks between Droplets in different datacenter regions.

## Enable VPC Networking on Existing Droplets

To enable VPC networking on an existing Droplet, you need to power the Droplet down. This safest way to do this is by logging into your Droplet and using the `shutdown` command with the `h` flag:

```shell
sudo shutdown -h now
```

The `-h` flag halts the system completely.

Once the Droplet is off, the next step is to enable private networking from the control panel. This gives you the address information you need to then configure it on the Droplet itself.

On the **Droplets** page, click the name of the Droplet, then click **Networking** in the left menu. In the **Private network** section, click the **Enable** button.

![The Droplet Networking page with the private networking enable button highlighted](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/vpc/resources/enable.2581078c438d8eef4f59ee1b34a4cf7fe717ba20bfff2a368151e2dbc67ec18d.png)

The page updates automatically and lists the private network information assigned to the Droplet. When you’re done, click the **OFF** button to switch the Droplet back **ON**.

![Powering on the Droplet by clicking the On/Off switch in the control panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/droplets/switch-on.ff337f00913f223f83a0b8d6f5c3098ef9ec49da1ec5cc77314c10138f03d377.png)

The Droplet is booted when the switch turns green and the label says **ON**.

### Network Configuration by Operating System

If your Droplet is apart of a VPC network but its private network interface hasn’t been enabled to communicate with the VPC network, you need to manually configure the private network interface on the Droplet itself. How you do this depends on which Linux distribution your Droplet is running.

Ubuntu 18.04

On Ubuntu 18.04, you need to use [Netplan](https://netplan.io/) to define the network interface using the Droplet’s private IP address and the MAC address for the Ethernet interface. You can learn more about Netplan and the files in `/etc/netplan` in [this section of What’s New in Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-s-new-in-ubuntu-18-04#netplan-and-systemd-networkd).

To get the MAC address, use `lshw` to list the details of your server’s network-class hardware.

```shell
lshw -class network
```

Locate `*-network:1` in the output. The `serial` value is the MAC address you need.

```text
. . .
*-network:1
    description: Ethernet controller
    . . .
    *-virtio1 DISABLED
        description: Ethernet interface
        physical id: 0
        bus info: virtio@1
        logical name: ens4
        serial: ex:am:pl:e3:65:13
. . .
```

At the bottom of `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`, add the following stanza.

`/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`

```yaml
        eth1:
            addresses:
            - 198.51.100.0/16
            match:
                macaddress: ex:am:pl:e3:65:13
            set-name: eth1
```

Replace the `addresses` value with the private IP address of the Droplet followed by the `/16` subnet prefix. Replace the `macaddress` value with the MAC address you found with `lshw`.

Errors in your syntax can disrupt your networking and force you to use the [Droplet console](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) to restore connectivity, so check the file’s syntax before you apply the changes.

```shell
sudo netplan apply --debug
```

If the file has syntax errors, this command returns the errors and doesn’t apply the changes. When the file’s syntax is correct, the command returns no output and applies the changes.

Reboot the Droplet one more time for the changes to take effect, and to verify that the configuration remains after the system is restarted:

```shell
sudo reboot
```

Ubuntu 16.04

On Ubuntu 16.04, you need to disable [consistent network device naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Network_Device_Naming) to make sure public traffic uses the `eth0` interface and private traffic uses the `eth1` interface.

Open `/etc/default/grub.d/50-cloudimg-settings.cfg` and edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` setting. At the end of the line, within the quotations, add `net.ifnames=0`:

`/etc/default/grub.d/50-cloudimg-settings.cfg`

```text
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="console=tty1 console=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
```

Save and close the file, then update GRUB with the new settings and reboot the Droplet.

```shell
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

After the Droplet finishes rebooting, reconnect with SSH.

Open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg` in a text editor and add a new section at the bottom of the file to define the interface for the VPC network. Substitute the IP address (`198.51.100.0`) in the `address` field for the Droplet’s private IP address located in the **Private Network** section of the Droplet’s **Networking** tab.

`/etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg`

```text
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 198.51.100.0
        netmask 255.255.0.0
```

Save and close the file then restart networking, which checks the configuration for errors and load the network interface.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

When the command is successful, it doesn’t return output.

Debian and Ubuntu 14.04

Warning
Standard support for [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ended](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) in April 2019. Because this distribution has reached end of life, we recommend [migrating to a newer release](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-migrate-linux-servers-part-1-system-preparation) so your Droplets remain supported and secure.

To add a private network interface to Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian distributions, open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor. Add a new section at the bottom of the file to define the interface for the VPC network. Substitute the IP address (`198.51.100.0`) in the `address` field for the Droplet’s private IP address located in the **Private Network** section of the Droplet’s **Networking** tab.

`/etc/network/interfaces`

```text
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 198.51.100.0
        netmask 255.255.0.0
```

Save and close the file, then use `ifup` to bring up the interface.

```shell
ifup eth1
```

When the command is successful, it doesn’t return output. If run more than once, the command returns `ifup: interface eth1 already configured`.

CentOS and Fedora

On CentOS and Fedora, get the hardware address for `eth1` with `ifconfig`.

```shell
sudo ifconfig -a
```

On **CentOS 7 and Fedora**, use the `ether` value in the `eth1` section:

```
eth1: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        ether 12:23:34:45:56:67  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
```

On **CentOS 6**, use the value of `HWaddr` in the `eth1` section:

```
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 12:23:34:45:56:67
        BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
```

Next, create and open a new file in the interface configuration directory called `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1`.

Enter the content below, substituting the values for the specific Droplet. `HWADDR` is the value from the `ifconfig` output, and the `IPADDR` value is displayed on the Droplet’s **Networking** tab in the **Private network** section.

`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1`

```text
DEVICE="eth1"
HWADDR=info_from_ifconfig
IPADDR=198.51.100.0
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT="yes"
NETMASK=255.255.0.0
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
IPV6INIT="no"
DEFROUTE="no"
```

Save and close the file, then use `ifup` to bring up the new network interface.

```shell
ifup eth1
```

When the command is successful, it doesn’t return output.

FreeBSD

On FreeBSD, you need to edit `/etc/rc.conf`.

In this file, locate the line which reads `# DigitalOcean Dynamic Configuration lines and the immediate line below it, are removed each boot`. Directly above that comment, add the following line, substituting in the private IP from on the Droplet’s **Networking** tab in the **Private network section**. The file should look like this:

`/etc/rc.conf`

```text
ifconfig_vtnet1="inet 198.51.100.0 netmask 255.255.0.0"

# DigitalOcean Dynamic Configuration lines and the immediate line below it,
# are removed each boot.
```

Save and close the file, then restart networking, which verifies the syntax of the changes and applies them.

```shell
sudo /etc/netstart
```

When the interface is successfully enabled, the output contains a `vtnet1` section with the private IP address.

## Verify the Configuration

You can verify the private network configuration with `ifconfig`.

```shell
sudo ifconfig
```

The output should contain a section for the interface that includes the private IP address and shows the status as `UP` and `RUNNING`.

On Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and Fedora), look for the `eth1` section:

```text
eth1: flags=4163< UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 198.51.100.0  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 192.0.2.255
        inet6 xxxx::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxx  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 12:34:46:78:98:10  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 258  bytes 13872 (13.5 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 146  bytes 10640 (10.3 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

On FreeBSD, look for the `vtnet1` section:

```text
vtnet1: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 1500
        options=6c07bb<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,JUMBO_MTU,VLAN_HWCSUM,TSO4,TSO6,LRO,VLAN_HWTSO,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6>
        ether 12:34:46:78:98:10
        hwaddr 12:34:46:78:98:10
        inet6 xxxx::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxx%vtnet1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x2
        inet 198.51.100.0 netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast 192.0.2.255
        nd6 options=21<PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>
        media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T <full-duplex>
        status: active
```

To fully test that the network is configured, try pinging the newly-enabled Droplet from a second Droplet on the VPC network.
