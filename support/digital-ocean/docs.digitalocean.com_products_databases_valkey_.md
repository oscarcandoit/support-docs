## Latest Updates

### Upcoming Changes

- [DigitalOcean Managed Caching](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/redis/) is being discontinued on 30 June 2025.

To replace Managed Caching, we are offering [Managed Valkey](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/valkey/), a Redis-compatible alternative with RDMA and higher throughput. All existing Managed Caching clusters automatically convert to Valkey clusters by 30 June 2025 during your [upgrade window](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/redis/how-to/schedule-updates/), retaining all data.


### 7 May 2025

- You can now [manually convert your Caching cluster to a Valkey cluster](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/valkey/getting-started/convert/). All Caching clusters automatically convert to Valkey clusters by the [Managed Caching discontinuation date](https://docs.digitalocean.com/release-notes/caching/).
