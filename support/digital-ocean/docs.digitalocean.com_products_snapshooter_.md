## Latest Updates

### 13 September 2024

- SnapShooter can now back up and restore cluster-internal resources such as databases on DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters. The new feature automatically installs a backup agent into your cluster, allowing SnapShooter to back up a variety of database types running in DOKS.

See [How to Back Up Resources on DigitalOcean Kubernetes with SnapShooter](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/snapshooter/how-to/back-up-doks/) for more details.


### 1 May 2024

- SnapShooter has removed support for Exoscale due to [Exoscale API deprecations](https://changelog.exoscale.com/en/deprecation-api-v1-as-of-may-1st-2024-uVYHUVZ3).

Customers who no longer require snapshot services after this change should [contact support](https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/) for a prorated refund.


### 21 November 2023

- SnapShooter _Server File_ backup jobs now have an _Include Git Repos?_ option to fully back up Git repos and their historical metadata. Without this option enabled, the files in a Git repo are backed up but the `.git` metadata directory is ignored.

See [How to Back Up Files with SnapShooter](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/snapshooter/how-to/back-up-files/) for more information on backing up files with SnapShooter.
