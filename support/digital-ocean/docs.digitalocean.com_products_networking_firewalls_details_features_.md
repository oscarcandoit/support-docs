# Firewalls Features

Validated on 19 Jun 2018 • Last edited on 19 May 2022

DigitalOcean Cloud Firewalls are a network-based, stateful firewall service for Droplets provided at no additional cost. Cloud firewalls block all traffic that isn’t expressly permitted by a rule.

Firewalls place a barrier between your servers and other machines on the network to protect them from external attacks. Firewalls can be host-based, which are configured on a per-server basis using services like IPTables or UFW. Others, like DigitalOcean Cloud Firewalls, are network-based and stop traffic at the network layer before it reaches the server.

You can apply cloud firewall rules to individual Droplets, but a more powerful option is to use [tags](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/tag/). Tags are custom labels that you can apply to Droplets and other DigitalOcean resources. When you add a tag to a firewall, any Droplets with that tag are automatically included in the firewall configuration.
