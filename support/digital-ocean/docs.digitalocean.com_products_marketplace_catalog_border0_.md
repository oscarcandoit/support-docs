# Border0

Generated on 20 Mar 2025
from [the Border0 catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/border0)

Easy and Secure Access to Your Infrastructure & Services using your SSO credentials

Border0 allows users to log in to Droplets, Databases, Containers, Kubernetes, and generic TCP services using their existing Single Sign On (SSO) credentials. While also replacing the need for a VPN

Border0 provides a flexible policy language allowing administrators to define who (identity) should have access to what resources, when (time-based), and from where (countries and IP addresses).

Services made available through Border0 can be in a private VPC, behind strict firewalls, or even behind NAT.

With Border0, users eliminate the need for VPNs. And it solves the problem of long-lived SSH keys, shared database credentials, or authenticated access to internal web applications.

## Software Included

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Border0 | 1.1 |  |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=border0)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Border0 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Border0 Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"border0"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Border0

To finish the configuration of your 1-Click Droplet you we will need a Border0 Account

We can get a free one here: [https://www.border0.com/](https://www.border0.com/)

Once we we are ready we can use Digital Ocean Console or SSH to our droplet

`ssh root@your_droplet_public_ipv4`

The wizard installer will be launched automatically on first login, simply follow the steps in the prompt.

Once a one-time login link is generated, we can paste it into our browser and complete the process of registering our Droplet with our Border0 accout

Once completed we can find our brad new 1-Click Border0 Connector in the admin portal [https://portal.border0.com/connectors](https://portal.border0.com/connectors)
