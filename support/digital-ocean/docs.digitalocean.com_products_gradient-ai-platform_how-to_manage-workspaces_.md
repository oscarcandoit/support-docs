# How to Create and Manage Workspaces on DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform

Validated on 1 Jul 2025 • Last edited on 8 Sep 2025

DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform lets you build fully-managed AI agents with knowledge bases for retrieval-augmented generation, multi-agent routing, guardrails, and more, or use serverless inference to make direct requests to popular foundation models.

Workspaces help you group related agents together under a single space. This makes it easier to manage agents, share them across your team, and run evaluations to test and compare their performance in a structured way.

All agents must reside in a workspace. You can add agents to an existing workspace upon creation, and move them between workspaces as needed. If you do not assign an agent to workspace upon creation, it is added to the default workspace.

Note
All agents created before the launch of the workspaces feature on 1 July 2025 have been automatically moved into a default workspace named `My Agent Workspace (Created by Default)`. You can [create additional workspaces](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/manage-workspaces/#create-a-workspace) at any time to reorganize or move your agents as needed.

## Create a Workspace

There are multiple ways to create a workspaces. You can create one:

- During the [agent creation workflow](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/create-agents/).
- From the **Agent Workspaces** tab in the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/).
- From the **Actions** menu button in the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/).

To create a workspace from the **Agent workspaces** tab, click the **Create workspace** button.

On the **Create a workspace** page, give the workspace a name and an optional description.

The **Move agents to workspace** section provides a list of existing agents associated with your [DigitalOcean team](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/). To move agents into the new workspace, click the checkbox beside the agents you want to add. You can use the search bar to filter the list for specific agents.

Once you’ve selected the agents you want to add to the workspace, click **Create Workspace**. This creates the workspace and adds it to your **Workspaces** tab.

## Move Agents Between Workspaces

You can move agents between workspaces at anytime.

To move agents between workspaces in the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click **Agent Platform** in the left menu, then in the **Agent Workspaces** tab, select the workspace you want to move agents either to or from. From the workspace’s **Agents** tab, click the **Action** button, and then select **Manage agents** from the drop-down menu.

From the **Move agents** page, select **Move to another workspace** to move agents from the selected workspace to another workspace on your team, or select **Move to this workspace** to move agents from other workspaces to the selected workspace.

If you selected the **Move to another workspace** option, select the workspace you want to move agents to from the **Select a workspace** drop-down menu.

Next, select the agents you want to move by clicking the checkboxes beside them. You can use the search bar to filter the list for specific agents.

Once you’ve selected the agent you want to move, click **Move agents**. The agents are moved to the desired workspace.

## Destroy a Workspace

Destroying a workspace permanently and irreversibly destroys the workspace. Before you can destroy a workspace, you must either move or [destroy](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/how-to/destroy-agents/) any remaining agents in the workspace.

To destroy a workspace from the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click **Agent Platform** in the left menu, then in the **Agent Workspaces** tab, select the workspace that you want to destroy. From the workspace’s overview page, select the **Settings** tab.

From the **Settings** tab, click **Destroy**. A prompt asks you to confirm the deletion by entering the name of the workspace. After entering the name of the workspace, click **Destroy**. The workspace is remove from your team.
