You cannot create Droplets in certain datacenters due to limited capacity. If you have snapshots in a limited capacity datacenter, transfer them to another datacenter to create Droplets from them.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I downsize a Droplet using a snapshot?

You cannot downsize a Droplet from a snapshot. Data is not always stored sequentially in memory, so reducing the size of a disk can result in data loss or corruption.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I choose my Droplet's IP address?

You cannot create Droplets with a specific IP address, but you can use reserved IPs for a static address that you can migrate between Droplets.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I clone or make a copy of a Droplet?

Create a snapshot of the Droplet, then create a new Droplet from that snapshot.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

How do I rename a Droplet or change its hostname?

To rename your Droplet, change the Droplet’s name in the control panel, then change its hostname from the command line using `hostnamectl` or by editing `/etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts`.
