# Reserved IP Limits

Validated on 18 Sep 2025 • Last edited on 18 Sep 2025

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Assign and reassign reserved IP addresses to Droplets as needed, or implement an automated failover mechanism with reserved IPs to build a high availability infrastructure.

## Reserved IPs

- By default, you can reserve three reserved IPs per account. If you reach this limit, you can request more through the control panel.

- You cannot assign a reserved IP to more than one Droplet at a time.

- You cannot assign reserved IPs to DigitalOcean Load Balancers.

- Droplets cannot have more than one reserved IP address or BYOIP address assigned to them at a time.

- Reserved IPs do not support PTR (rDNS) records.

- We do not support reserved IPs for DigitalOcean Kubernetes worker nodes.

- A Droplet must have an anchor IP before you can assign a reserved IPv4 to it. Droplets created after 20 October 2015 automatically have an anchor IP, and you can [create an anchor IP on older Droplets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/how-to/manually-enable/).

- Droplets created from a [custom image](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/custom-images/) do not receive an [anchor IP address](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/how-to/find-anchor-ips/) and do not require one to use a [reserved IP](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/). When you assign a reserved IP address to a Droplet created from a custom image, the reserved IP is automatically mapped to the Droplet’s public IPv4 address instead of an anchor IP.

- You cannot delete a currently-assigned reserved IPv6 address. Unassign the address from its Droplet before deleting it.

- You must use `doctl` v1.120.0 or higher to create and manage reserved IPv6 addresses on the command line.


## Bring Your Own IPs

- Only IPv4 addresses are supported.

- BYOIP addresses can only be assigned to Droplets.

- BYOIP does not support network prefixes smaller than `/24` (256 addresses) or larger than `/18` (16,384 addresses).

- The first and second IP addresses of a BYOIP subnet are reserved and not assignable to resources.

- Droplets cannot have more than one BYOIP address or reserved IP address assigned to them at a time.

- Each BYOIP prefix is added to a single datacenter and can only be assigned to resources within that datacenter.
