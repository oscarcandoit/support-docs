## Control Your Costs

Cap your storage and bandwidth quota with a maximum monthly cost. SFTP To Go’s limits are soft, meaning your service won’t be turned off for occasional storage or bandwidth spikes. If you exceed your plan limit for two consecutive months or surpass it significantly, we will contact you to discuss suitable upgrade options.
