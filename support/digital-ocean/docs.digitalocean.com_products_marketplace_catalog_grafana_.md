[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=grafana-18-04)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Grafana 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Grafana Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"grafana-18-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Grafana

After you create a Grafana One-Click Droplet, Grafana will be installed. Start adding your datasources and dashboards by visiting http://Droplet\_IP:3000 The default login credentials are admin/admin - you will be prompted to change this after your first login.

- 3000 is the default http port that Grafana listens to. To change this visit [http://docs.grafana.org/installation/configuration/#http-port](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/configuration/#http-port)
