# Workflowsprivate

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

Workflows automate machine learning tasks, combining GPU instances with an expressive syntax to generate production-ready machine learning pipelines with a few lines of code.

## Latest Updates

### 15 May 2024

- A [new API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/paperspace/api-reference/) for managing Paperspace resources is now available. The API provides:


  - A unified and predictable endpoint schema

  - Improved performance and scalability

  - Documented support for API endpoints


We have deprecated the legacy Gradient and Core API endpoints, so they are now unavailable for Paperspace users. Applications must use the new API to retain functionality. You can [submit a support ticket](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/paperspace/#open-a-ticket) for questions or assistance.

### 14 December 2023

- Paperspace changes are now tracked through DigitalOcean’s release notes. See [Paperspace changelog](https://updates.paperspace.com/) for the new Paperspace products and features released prior to 14 December 2023.


### 1 December 2023

- As part of the [Paperspace acquisition by DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/paperspace-joins-digitalocean), there are now several changes to billing for Paperspace users:


  - You now receive invoices from DigitalOcean. Invoice emails are sent from `support@digitalocean.com` with a PDF copy attached.

  - Your account is migrated to the DigitalOcean billing experience on `cloud.digitalocean.com`, where you can view details like team balance, itemized charges, and payment methods. You can no longer filter and review usage by user ID.

  - Your current Paperspace payment method has been migrated and you do not need to take any action.

  - Your team compute alerts have been migrated as [DigitalOcean billing alerts](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/billing-alerts/). We do not support billing alerts for specific users. You can no longer create or use compute limits that restrict resource creation or forcefully terminate running workloads.

  - The Paperspace referral system is temporarily discontinued. If you have claimed credits from previous referrals, they are honored for Paperspace services.


If you are having trouble making a payment, please contact the Paperspace support team. Learn more about DigitalOcean’s [monthly billing cycle](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/), [payment methods](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/manage-payment-methods/), and [late payments](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/late-payments/).
