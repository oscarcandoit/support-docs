# Machines How-Tos

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

Machines are Linux and Windows virtual machines with persistent storage, GPU options, and free unlimited bandwidth. They’re designed for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

## Getting Started

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Create a Machine

Create a Linux machine to run workloads or applications. You can configure the machine to suit your needs, whether for development, testing, or production.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Connect to a Machine

Connect to your Linux machine securely via SSH using the Paperspace console or desktop app.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Manage User Access

Manage user access to your Paperspace machine, allowing team members to collaborate and share resources. Add or remove users to control who can access and administer your machine.

## Machine Management

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Deactivate a Machine

Deactivate a Paperspace machine to permanently delete the machine, its files, and its snapshots from your Paperspace account.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Enable or Disable Auto-shutdown

Automatically turn off your machine after a period of inactivity using the auto-shutdown feature. This helps you manage resources efficiently by turning off idling machines.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Take, Revert to, or Delete a Snapshot

Protect your machines and its data by taking, reverting to, or deleting snapshots, which are disk images that capture the state of your machine at a specific point in time. Use snapshots as backups to protect against data loss, system failures, or other unintended issues.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Create or Delete a Custom Template

Use custom templates to create machines with specific machine configurations. Custom templates allow you to replicate your machine setup, including installed software and configurations, for consistent and efficient workflows. You can also delete templates that you no longer need.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Enable or Disable Advanced Desktop Streaming Settings

Enable or disable advanced desktop streaming settings, like Gamer Mode for enhanced mouse control and resolution snapping or USB mouse emulation for addresing mouse issues in games and other applications.

## Configuration

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Resize a Machine

Resize your machine when needed by adjusting its machine type for better performance or increasing its disk size for more storage. This allows you to optimize resources based on your workload requirements.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

Use Windows Features

Windows-based machines offer features designed to enhance your experience, such as clipboard syncing and the Paperspace Password Tool.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Enable or Disable NVLink

Enhance data transfer speeds and scalability between NVIDIA GPUs for high-performance computing tasks by enabling NVLink. Disable NVLink on H100x1 machines to use CUDA.

## Manage Data

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Transfer Files Between Machines

Transfer files between your Windows-based machine and other devices using FileZilla, `scp`, `wget`, or Windows’ Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), depending on your needs for secure or public file transfers.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Create, Mount, or Delete a Shared Drive

Enable secure storage accessible from multiple machines in a private network with shared drives.

## Networking

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Create, Delete, or Migrate a Machine to a Private Network

Connect machines and shared drives on a logically isolated private network for secure communication or to enable a VPN. Migrate machines between different private networks at any time.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Assign or Remove a Public IP Address

Assign a public IP address to your machine to make it accessible over the internet, or remove the public IP address when your machine no longer needs external access.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/machines.svg)

How to Create or Delete a Virtual Private Network

Set up a secure site-to-site VPN connection using a VPN gateway to enable encrypted, two-way communication between your Paperspace machines and external networks, such as your local network or a third-party location. You can create or delete a VPN through the Paperspace console by submitting a request to Paperspace support.

How to Assign or Unassign a Hostname

Assign a persistent hostname to your machine to keep the hostname consistent after shutdowns and restarts.
