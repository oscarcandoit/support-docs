# Portainer Community Edition

Generated on 29 Jan 2021
from [the Portainer Community Edition catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/portainer-community-edition)

Portainer is the definitive open source container management tool for Kubernetes, Docker, Docker Swarm and Azure ACI. It allows anyone to deploy and manage containers without the need to write code.

Portainer implements and enforces sane defaults so as to ensure any app deployed is safe and secure. In addition, Portainer includes a comprehensive rules and validation engine, so that your deployments work within Kubernetes constraints. The tool abstracts all of the Kubernetes syntax and translates it into easy to understand, natural language deployment intentions. There’s no need to know what a persistent volume claim is, or understand the difference between a StatefulSet, DaemonSet, and ReplicaSet. There’s also no need to worry about running out of resources and deployments failing. Portainer has you covered.

## Software Included

_This Marketplace listing does not include a detailed software list._

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to install a Kubernetes 1-Click Application. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters/new?addonslug=portainer&nodePools=s-1vcpu-2gb%3A3&region=sfo2)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating Portainer Community Edition using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 3 node DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster made up of Basic Droplets in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `doctl` command. You need to authenticate with `doctl` with your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and replace the `$CLUSTER_NAME` variable with the chosen name for your cluster in the command below.

```shell
doctl kubernetes clusters create --size s-4vcpu-8gb $CLUSTER_NAME --1-clicks portainer
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Portainer Community Edition

Portainer will deploy a DO Load Balancer and provision persistent storage for the Portainer DB.

Connect to Portainer using the public IP address of your DO Load Balancer and port 9000; set the initial admin username and password as soon as possible after deployment.
