# ONLYOFFICE Docs

Generated on 1 Nov 2025
from [the ONLYOFFICE Docs catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/onlyoffice-docs)

ONLYOFFICE Docs is an open-source office suite that comprises web-based viewers and collaborative editors for text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations providing high compatibility with OOXML files (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). Other popular formats such as .doc, .odt, .rtf, .txt, .pdf, .xls, .ods, .csv, .ppt, .odp, etc. are also supported.

You are able to edit complex docs using multiple styling and formatting tools, e.g. shapes, charts, Text Art, drop caps, footnotes, bookmarks, mirror and gutter margins, and more. The pre-installed plugin set as well as the possibility to add your own plugins allows you to implement extra functionality.

You can read and annotate PDF files, create and fill out PDF forms.

With multiple collaborative features you can work on the same document together with your teammates: use real-time and paragraph-locking co-editing modes, track changes, comments, built-in chat, version history.

**The 1-click version of ONLYOFFICE Docs on DigitalOcean is a free version (ONLYOFFICE Docs Community Edition) distributed under GNU AGPL v3.0.** As long as you respect the license, you can use the editors for free.

Note that ONLYOFFICE Docs doesn’t contain any document management system.

ONLYOFFICE Docs can be:

- integrated with various cloud storage platforms like Confluence, Alfresco, WordPress, Nextcloud, Jira, Strapi, Redmine, ownCloud, Seafile, SharePoint, HumHub, Plone, etc. You can upgrade to [ONLYOFFICE Docs Enterprise Edition](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs-enterprise-prices.aspx) in case you need a scalable solution with professional support.
- integrated into the solution you’re building yourself. You can upgrade to [ONLYOFFICE Docs Developer Edition](https://www.onlyoffice.com/developer-edition-prices.aspx) if you’re planning to deliver your solution to the end users under your corporate brand.
- used as a part of [ONLYOFFICE Workspace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/workspace.aspx), a complete bundle of office apps for efficient team and project management, or [ONLYOFFICE DocSpace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docspace.aspx), a room-based collaboration environment (upgrading to the scalable enterprise version is also possible).

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=ascensiosystemsi-onlyofficeeditor-18-04-4)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the ONLYOFFICE Docs 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB ONLYOFFICE Docs Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"ascensiosystemsi-onlyofficeeditor-18-04-4"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying ONLYOFFICE Docs

After you create your ONLYOFFICE One-Click Droplet:

- Briefly visit the Droplet via SSH `ssh root@My_Droplet_IP` to finalize the configuration.
- Then run `http://public IP address/`.
- To easily integrate ONLYOFFICE Docs with one of the platforms like Alfresco, Confluence, Nextcloud, ownCloud, SharePoint, Liferay, etc. you can use integration connectors for these solutions as it is described here: [https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/plugins](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/plugins). Use the public IP address or public DNS to specify the Document Server address in your web application settings, e.g. `http://public IP address/`. To integrate ONLYOFFICE Docs with your own web application, you can refer to the API Documentation [https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/basic](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/basic).

For additional information on configuring, operating, and updating ONLYOFFICE Docs, please refer to the official [Help Center](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-index.aspx).

Support for the free community version is provided via the [User Forum](https://forum.onlyoffice.com/). If you need additional paid support, please [send your re quest](mailto:sales@onlyoffice.com).
