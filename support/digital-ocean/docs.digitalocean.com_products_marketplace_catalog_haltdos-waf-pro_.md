[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=haltdos-haltdoswafpro)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Haltdos WAF Pro 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Haltdos WAF Pro Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"haltdos-haltdoswafpro"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

After the user has entered their details, user will be redirected to a payment gateway. A minimal amount transaction will take place to save the card, which will be refunded back by the card provider/bank. Card must be saved because Haltdos Professional WAF follows a usage based pricing. User will be charged at the end of the monthly billing period, based on the no. of requests that was processed by WAF in that billing period. User has to enter their credit card details and click on the Save Card button of the payment gateway.
