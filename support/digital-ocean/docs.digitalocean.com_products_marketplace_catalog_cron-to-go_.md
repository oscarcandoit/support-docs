Used by over 4,000 leading companies and organizations - like **Aligntech**, **Capgemini**, **Martin Brower**, **PWC**, **Hyundai**, and [many more](https://crontogo.com/blog/customers), Cron To Go is a fully managed cloud scheduler that runs scheduled tasks on your applications.

### Cron To Go vs. Heroku’s scheduler

Sure, Heroku Scheduler is free, but Cron To Go…

- Works on all dyno types—standard dynos as well as perf, private, and shield dynos.
- Offers flexible scheduling options, with 60 second precision, using the familiar **Unix cron format** including **every X minutes**.
- Monitors your job executions and **presents real-time logs** to debug your tasks, in addition to sending you _e-mail, Slack, Microsoft Teams and webhook notifications_.
- Lets you set **alternative timezones**, in addition to the default UTC.
- Offers an [API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/cron-to-go/) and [Heroku CLI plugin](https://github.com/crazyantlabs/heroku-cli-plugin-cron) to automate your task scheduling.
- May not be free like Heroku scheduler, but it is a **production-grade** service that provides priceless quality and reliability.
- Offers **real-time chat, email support and premium support**, providing answers to all your questions.

## Fully managed and reliable scheduler

Cron To Go is a **distributed, scalable and reliable** cloud scheduler. Cron is no longer a single point of failure with guaranteed at-least-once delivery to your job targets. In case of failures, schedules are re-triggered to assure they are delivered at least once.

## Manage all schedules in one place

Cron To Go allows you to manage all of your automation tasks in a single place with an easy to use UI and [API](https://crontogo.com/blog/api-reference/).

## Designed with security in mind

Cron To Go fulfills diverse compliance, auditing, and accountability requirements. It accommodates multiple geographic data centers to align with various local privacy regulations and many more features with security in mind.

![GDPR](https://res.cloudinary.com/hbdyf1hp4/image/upload/compliance/GDPR_lqsgjt.svg)![SOC 2 Type 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/hbdyf1hp4/image/upload/compliance/SOC2_lg50m7.svg)![HIPAA](https://res.cloudinary.com/hbdyf1hp4/image/upload/compliance/HIPAA_cux0fl.svg)

Cron To Go is fully compliant with **SOC 2 Type II**, **HIPAA** and **GDPR** for optimal protection of sensitive information.

## Flexible job scheduling

You can define schedules with **60-second precision** across **various time zones**, using either the familiar **Unix cron format** or **simple rate expressions**. This flexibility enables your jobs to run **multiple times a day**, on **specific days**, and at **precise times of the week or month**.

## Monitoring and logging

Monitor your job executions and view real-time logs to debug your tasks. In addition, Cron To Go provides personalized, real-time e-mail, Slack, Microsoft Teams and webhook notifications to inform other applications about job starts, completions, or failures, enhancing monitoring and ensuring seamless integration with your code.

## One-Off Dynos support

Cron To Go will spawn one-off Dynos with your commands and environment to save on costs. No need to keep a clock dyno or a web dyno 24/7 to respond to scheduled HTTP requests.
