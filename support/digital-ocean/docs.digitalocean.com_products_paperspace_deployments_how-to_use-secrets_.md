# How to Use Secrets and Environment Variables in Gradient Deployments

Validated on 14 Dec 2023 • Last edited on 18 Dec 2024

Paperspace Deployments are containers-as-a-service that allow you to run container images and serve machine learning models using a high-performance, low-latency service with a RESTful API.

Deployment secrets can be used to inject sensitive configuration into your application environment.

## Reference Secrets

[Paperspace secrets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/paperspace/accounts-and-teams/use-secrets/) can be created and managed in the console. Secrets can contain sensitive information like access keys, tokens, etc. To reference these Paperspace secrets in your deployment spec, use the following syntax `secret:mySecretValue`.

## Pass Environment Variables

Create environment variables that can be accessed through your running deployment containers.

You can pass environment variables into their deployment that can accessed by the container services running on the deployment replicas.

```yaml
env: # container environment variables
    - name: some-env
        value: some-value
    - name: secret-env
        value: secret:mySecretEnv # stored as a project or team secret. Naming is arbitrary.
```

The value “some-value” and the Paperspace secret value stored as `mySecretEnv` are accessible in your container application code under the name `some-env` and `secret-env` respectively.
