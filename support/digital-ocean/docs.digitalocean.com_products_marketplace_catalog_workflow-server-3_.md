# Workflow Server 3

Generated on 29 Jan 2024
from [the Workflow Server 3 catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/workflow-server-3)

Workflow Server is 100% ready to work. Simply launch it and start creating processes via HTTP API straight away and manage your processes via the admin interface.

Workflow Server covers all workflow cases for document approval systems and demonstrates perfect performance. It’s enough for any solution from corporate systems to IoT platforms.

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Workflow Server 3 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Workflow Server 3 Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"optimajet-workflowserver3"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```
