## Latest Updates

### 15 May 2024

- A [new API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/paperspace/api-reference/) for managing Paperspace resources is now available. The API provides:


  - A unified and predictable endpoint schema

  - Improved performance and scalability

  - Documented support for API endpoints


We have deprecated the legacy Gradient and Core API endpoints, so they are now unavailable for Paperspace users. Applications must use the new API to retain functionality. You can [submit a support ticket](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/paperspace/#open-a-ticket) for questions or assistance.

### 21 December 2023

- Gradient Deployments can now be created with secured endpoints using basic access authentication encoded tokens. For more information, see [Endpoint Security](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/paperspace/deployments/reference/endpoint-security/).

- We have released an updated Container Registry experience to give customers enhanced management of their private registries. This includes additional features to add, validate, and edit containers, as well as changes to ensure Gradient Deployments with containers start successfully. For more information, see [Manage Containers](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/paperspace/notebooks/how-to/manage-containers/).


### 14 December 2023

- Paperspace changes are now tracked through DigitalOcean’s release notes. See [Paperspace changelog](https://updates.paperspace.com/) for the new Paperspace products and features released prior to 14 December 2023.
