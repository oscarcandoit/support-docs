# Kafka Pricing

Validated on 8 Dec 2022 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

Kafka is an open-source distributed event and stream-processing platform built to process demanding real-time data feeds. It is inherently scalable, with high throughput and availability.

You can create up to fifteen-node Kafka clusters. We support the following Basic and General Purpose Droplets for use in Kafka clusters:

| Droplet Type | CPU | 3-Node Cluster Cost | vCPUs | RAM | Disk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | Shared | $147.00 per month | 3 | 6 GiB |  |
| Basic | Shared | $294.00 per month | 6 | 12 GiB |  |
| General Purpose | Dedicated | $597.00 per month | 6 | 24 GiB |  |
| General Purpose | Dedicated | $1197.00 per month | 12 | 48 GiB |  |

The three-node cluster cost applies to each multiple of 3 nodes in your cluster. For example, a three-node cluster of 6 vCPU Droplets costs $597.00 per month, so a six-node cluster would cost $1194.00 per month.

Additional storage you add to the cluster costs $0.21 per GiB per month.

Traffic to and from [managed databases](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/) does not count against your bandwidth billing transfer allowance.

## Plans for Cluster Nodes

All managed databases are deployed onto Droplets with either [shared or dedicated CPU](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/concepts/choosing-a-plan/#shared-vs-dedicated). For a list of the Droplet plans we offer for Kafka, see the [Managed Databases pricing page](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/managed-databases#kafka).
