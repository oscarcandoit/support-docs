**Snapshooter has taken more than 9 million DigitalOcean snapshots! Hear what our customers have to say about us**

“Siebird has trusted SnapShooter to back up and protect our client websites for over 2.5 years. We host all our client websites on DigitalOcean. From the beginning, SnapShooter stood out from the rest with how effortless it has made configuring backups. We have peace of mind knowing our client websites are protected and can be restored with a click of a button.”

**Siebird, a web design and digital marketing agency**

Webspec has been utilizing SnapShooter for our backups for about a year now, and it has relieved so much stress from our team. We know that backups are being taken, and on the off chance that they fail for some reason, we know that they’ve failed through the integrated Slack and email notifications. Prior to using SnapShooter, when our development staff would request a backup a pang of anxiety would shoot through us because we were never 100% sure backups had completed successfully. The SnapShooter team has also been an absolute pleasure to work with; we’ve had very few issues, and they were always able to get them resolved or get us a better solution within 24 hours. Moving from our custom solution to SnapShooter was also a breeze. We were able to set up approximately 200 servers across two weeks, with the majority of the time going towards testing to ensure it all worked properly (spoiler alert: it did, even without intervention from us).

**Webspec Design LLC**

“We’ve been using SnapShooter for our database backups since 2021, after switching from a self-built solution. We use it to backup both our DigitalOcean managed and self-managed Postgres databases to DigitalOcean Spaces. Since using SnapShooter, we’ve had a lot of peace-of-mind knowing that we have reliable and historic backups that just work. The reporting feature is also really helpful for us. Overall, we love SnapShooter because it provides us with the features and reliability we need to ensure our business data is always safe and secure.”

**Datacake.io \| Lukas Klein- CTO & Founder**

SnapShooter is an absurdly well-made product that I have been using for months to backup a whole range of things, from MySQL to servers and DigitalOcean and AWS to my code at GitHub. The UI is great for understanding and helping you get your backups set, and it made the whole process a joy. All my backups are actively monitored, and data is now safely backed up to my own AWS S3 account.
