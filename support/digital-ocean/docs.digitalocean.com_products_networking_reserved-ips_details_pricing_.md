# Reserved IPs Pricing

Validated on 25 Jun 2025 • Last edited on 25 Jun 2025

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Assign and reassign reserved IP addresses to Droplets as needed, or implement an automated failover mechanism with reserved IPs to build a high availability infrastructure.

All reserved IPs are free when assigned to a Droplet.

Reserved IPv4 addresses cost $5.00 per month ($0.01 per hour) when reserved but not assigned to a Droplet, due to the shortage of available IPv4 addresses. You are not billed unless you accrue $1 or more per reserved IP.

Reserved IPv6 addresses are free even when not assigned to a Droplet.

Provisioning BYOIP address blocks and using BYOIP addresses is free.

Data transfer from reserved IP and BYOIP addresses is subject to standard [Droplet bandwidth billing](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/details/pricing/#bandwidth-billing).
