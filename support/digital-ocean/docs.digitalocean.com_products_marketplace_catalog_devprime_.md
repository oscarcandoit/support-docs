# Devprime

Generated on 18 Apr 2024
from [the Devprime catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/devprime)

Devprime is a platform designed for developers to enhance the quality of their software by enabling them to build cloud-native, distributed applications with ease. The platform offers foundational components and accelerators as an engineering solution, which simplifies the development of complex applications, enabling the development of the first cloud-native microservice in just 30 minutes. Devprime provides a complete software architecture design that standardizes development, simplifies maintainability, and increases productivity.

The platform offers a set of core tools such as the Developer CLI (Command-line interface) or “dp” and the Devprime stack, which accelerate the Developer Experience (DX) by simplifying the Developer Tools journey from standardized Onboarding and following good software development practices. Devprime applications are based on a hexagonal software architecture approach with event-driven and domain-driven design (DDD) practices.

Devprime’s applications automatically orchestrate many important decisions within adapters such as observability (Log, Distributed Trace, Metrics) according to the OpenTelemetry pattern. They expose web APIs, enable security integration with identity providers, give access through State adapters for persistence in most often used repository technologies like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and add sync Stream integration with Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other technologies.

Devprime applications have built-in Stack with smart behaviors for distributed systems like Observability, which includes logs, trace, and metrics. There are also resilient routines like retry and circuit break for databases, stream communication, or external API calls. When it comes to Stream-out delivery errors, the Devprime stack has automatic fallbacks, and for Stream-in errors, the users can define if they want to reject or not each event based on business considerations.

In summary, Devprime is a developer platform that offers a complete software architecture design and accelerators with production-ready code implementations. It is designed to increase developer productivity, simplify maintainability, and accelerate the development of distributed systems. It is a platform specialized in software developer productivity and application architecture quality, high scalability, and high-performance scenarios with built-in functionalities for distributed systems.
