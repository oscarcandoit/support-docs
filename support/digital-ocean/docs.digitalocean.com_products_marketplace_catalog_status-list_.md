# Status List

Generated on 16 Oct 2023
from [the Status List catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/statuslist)

## Know when things aren’t working

We monitor your web service and tell you when your service is down or running extremely slow. We track incidents and diagnostic details for you. Provide a more reliable service for your customers by fixing downtime and performance issues before they even notice.

## Communicate with a Hosted Status Page and Incident Tracking

Deflect customers to your hosted status page during an outage. Keep affected customers in the loop by posting updates with the messaging feature. Show selected uptime details so customers know whether components are running normally. Reduce the noise during outages with a status page.

## It’s really simple

View all your monitors and their statuses on a single page. Smart alerts bubble to the surface, so you don’t have to drill into each monitor to get the important stuff. If you want to debug something, just expand a monitor and your diagnosis toolbox is ready to go!
