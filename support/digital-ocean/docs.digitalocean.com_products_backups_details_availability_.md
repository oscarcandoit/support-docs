# Backups Availability

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

Backups are automatically-created disk images of Droplets. Enabling backups for Droplets enables system-level backups at weekly or daily intervals, which provides a way to revert to an older state or create new Droplets.

| Droplet Backups | NYC1 | NYC2 | NYC3 | AMS3 | SFO2 | SFO3 | SGP1 | LON1 | FRA1 | TOR1 | BLR1 | SYD1 | ATL1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Daily |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
