# MariaDB

Generated on 7 Nov 2023
from [the MariaDB catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/mariadb)

The MariaDB database was born after Oracle acquired MySQL. With the original core MySQL team, we have added functionality to the MariaDB database that competes with legacy database systems like Oracle at a fraction of the cost. We have added columnar analytics, JSON functionality and Oracle compatibility, and we offer a fully managed cloud database service that offers the full breadth of MariaDB database solutions supporting private, public, hybrid and multicloud strategies.

Today, the MariaDB database is recognized as a distinct database around the world. MariaDB is the new “M” in the LAMP stack, it’s the default over MySQL in the majority of Linux distributions, it’s replacing Oracle and other legacy databases at increasing rates and it’s available in every cloud. MariaDB is everywhere.

## Software Included

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 10.6.12 | [GPL](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-licenses/) |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the MariaDB 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB MariaDB Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"mariadb"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying MariaDB

After the app is installed, it runs automatically `mysql_secure_installation` at the login to finish MariaDB setup process.
