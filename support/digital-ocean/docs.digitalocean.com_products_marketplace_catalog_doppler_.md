# Doppler

Generated on 4 Mar 2021
from [the Doppler catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/doppler)

Struggling with scattered secrets, home-brewed tools, or not wanting to pay thousands of dollars? Doppler is the easiest way to securely manage all your environment variables in one place. Get set up in minutes not months with developer-friendly pricing. Managing your projects and team’s access to secrets is straightforward. Doppler works the same way in every environment and has integrations with all cloud providers.

Our integration with Digital Ocean automatically installs the Doppler CLI and lets you easily fetch your secrets from your single source of truth in Doppler.

## Software Included

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Doppler CLI | [3.21.0](https://github.com/DopplerHQ/cli/releases/tag/3.21.0) | [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/DopplerHQ/cli/blob/master/LICENSE) |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Doppler 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Doppler Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"doppler-20-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Doppler

Generate a new service token and export this into your environment. After that simply run `doppler run -- your-command-here` to inject all your secrets into your application.
