# Backups

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

Backups are automatically-created disk images of Droplets. Enabling backups for Droplets enables system-level backups at weekly or daily intervals, which provides a way to revert to an older state or create new Droplets.

## Latest Updates

### 1 October 2025

- Now in public preview, you can [customize a usage-based backup plan](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/backups/how-to/enable/) for regular and GPU Droplets. This plan’s cost is based on the amount of storage your backups use, instead of a flat percentage of the Droplet’s cost. Additionally, you can configure how often backups happen and for how long you retain them.


### 4 October 2024

- Daily backups are now available in BLR1.


### 17 September 2024

- Daily backups are now in [general availability](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/product-lifecycle/).
