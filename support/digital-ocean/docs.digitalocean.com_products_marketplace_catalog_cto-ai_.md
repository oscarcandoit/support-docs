# CTO.ai

Generated on 28 Nov 2023
from [the CTO.ai catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/cto-ai)

CTO.ai delivers DevOps as a Service coupled with a software delivery platform to accelerate your adoption of DevOps, CI/CD or DigitalOcean Kubernetes. Our team brings both expertise and a technology platform to automate and measure developer workflows, improve developer experience, increase developer productivity, and automatically capture software delivery and operational performance metrics in real time.

### Free Plan: DevOps Readiness Assessment

Whether you are new to DevOps, CI/CD and Kubernetes, or migrating from another cloud, our platform engineers will work with you to ensure your DevOps workloads are optimized for DigitalOcean Kubernetes with robust CI/CD. All engagements start with a DevOps Readiness Assessment.

### Professional Plan: Kubernetes Delivery and Infrastructure Modernization

After completing a DevOps Readiness Assessment, purchase a Professional Plan for an annual subscription to the CTO.ai Developer Control Plane. Our platform engineering team will operationalize our platform, integrate with your existing tools, optimize how you build, preview and deploy your applications to Kubernetes, and modernize your infrastructure to leverage Infrastructure as Code.

- Easily measure software delivery in real time from any CI/CD using DORA metrics
- Compose an extensible CI/CD pipeline that works with any cloud & Infrastructure as Code
- Automate DevOps for Developers using containers and support SlackOps, GitOps, and Instant Preview URLs
- Give your Developers a single point to interface with all of their mission-critical workflows across your entire toolchain, without barriers or toil
