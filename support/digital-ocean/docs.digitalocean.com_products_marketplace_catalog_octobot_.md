## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=drakkarsoftware-octobot)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the OctoBot 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB OctoBot Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"drakkarsoftware-octobot"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying OctoBot

## How to get started with your OctoBot

1. Choose your strategy:

* * *

- You can choose a pre-configured strategy available on octobot.cloud
- Or create your own strategy by customizing built-in strategies. Learn more about OctoBot [supported strategies](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/octobot-trading-modes/trading-modes?utm_source=digitalocean&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=get_started).

![OctoBot pre-configured strategy available on octobot.cloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/assets/DigitalOcean/download-octobot-cloud-strategies-in-open-source-bot.png)

2. Choose your exchange

* * *

Choose your favorite cryptocurrencies trading [exchange](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/exchanges?utm_source=digitalocean&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=get_started). OctoBot officially supports many exchanges and some others are tested by its community of users.

![OctoBot supported exchanges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/assets/DigitalOcean/octobot-supported-exchanges.png)

3. Test your strategy

* * *

You should test your strategy before using real funds. OctoBot offers two ways to do it:

- [A simulation mode](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/octobot-usage/simulator?utm_source=digitalocean&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=get_started): using this mode, OctoBot will simulate trades using the exact same process as with the real trading mode.
- [A backtesting feature](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/octobot-usage/backtesting?utm_source=digitalocean&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=get_started): it’s the process of testing a strategy’s performances on past data. It uses recorded data of cryptocurrency or stock markets.

![OctoBot backtesting result summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/assets/DigitalOcean/octobot-backtesting-result-summary.png)

4. Use real money

* * *

Once you have tested your strategy, just [add your exchange API keys](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/guides/octobot-configuration/accounts?utm_source=digitalocean&utm_medium=dk&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=get_started) and start using your strategy on your portfolio
