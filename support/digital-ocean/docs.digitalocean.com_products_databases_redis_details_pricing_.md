# Caching Pricing

Validated on 20 Aug 2019 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

Managed Caching is a database engine that supports Redis, an open source, key-value database built with an in-memory design that emphasizes speed. It supports rich data types, atomic operations, and Lua scripting.

There are two kinds of database cluster plans you can choose from: single node clusters and high availability clusters.

- **Single node clusters** begin at $15.00 per month for a single node cluster with 1 GiB of RAM. Single node clusters are not highly available, but they feature automatic failover. We recommend these clusters for preliminary development and testing.

- **High availability clusters** begin at $30.00 per month for a 2 GiB RAM/1 vCPU primary node with at least one $30.00 per month matching standby node for automatic failover.

You can add or remove standby nodes at any time. Other features, like point-in-time recovery and read-only nodes, vary by database engine. [Learn more about feature availability](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/#feature-availability).


Traffic to and from [managed databases](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/) does not count against your bandwidth billing transfer allowance.

## Plans for Cluster Nodes

All managed databases are deployed onto Droplets with either [shared or dedicated CPU](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/concepts/choosing-a-plan/#shared-vs-dedicated). For a list of the Droplet plans we offer for Caching, see the [Managed Databases pricing page](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/managed-databases#caching).
