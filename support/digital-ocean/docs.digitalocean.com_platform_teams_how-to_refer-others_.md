# How To Participate in DigitalOcean's Referral Program

Validated on 14 May 2024 • Last edited on 18 Mar 2025

You can earn credit by referring others to DigitalOcean with a team’s unique referral link.

When someone signs up for DigitalOcean using your referral link and adds a valid payment method, they immediately receive a $200, 60-day account credit. In return, once the person you refer spends $25 as a DigitalOcean customer, we give your team $25 in credit. There’s no limit to the amount of referral credit you can earn.

Note
You cannot receive referral credit as cash or transfer the credit to other teams.

## Referral Link

You can get your referral link in the control panel. In the left menu, click **Settings**, then click the **Referrals** tab to go to the [referrals page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/referrals).

The **Share your unique URL** section has your referral link and an option to **Share via X** (formerly Twitter) directly.

Referral links are unique to each team. You can invite up to 30 people per day. There is no limit to the overall number of invitations you can send.

## Referral Badge

You can also embed a visual badge on your website or content to link users directly to your referral URL.

The **Add a referral badge** section has three styles of badge to choose from:

For convenience, we automatically generate a line of code in HTML or Markdown with the badge style you chose and your referral link already embedded.

## Referral Statistics

The referral page also has statistics about your link, including how many times your link has been clicked and how many referrals you’ve made. You can also see how much credit has been applied to your team and how much credit is pending from referrals who haven’t met the spending threshold yet.
