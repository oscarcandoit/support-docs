# Open Source Social Network

Generated on 4 Sep 2025
from [the Open Source Social Network catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/open-source-social-network)

Open Source Social Network (OSSN) is a powerful, open source social network software written in PHP. It lets you easily create and host your own private social networking site, with full control over your data and community. Whether you’re building a platform for professional collaboration or personal connections, OSSN provides all the essential features to help users connect, share, and communicate.

Designed for flexibility and privacy, OSSN is available in 10 international languages and is completely free to use. Deploy your social network free with OSSN and start building your online community today.

| --- | --- | --- |

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Open Source Social Network 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Open Source Social Network Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"softlab24-opensourcesocial-18-04"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```
