## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Vodia Multi-tenant Cloud PBX 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Vodia Multi-tenant Cloud PBX Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"vodianetworks-vodiaphonesystem-10"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```
