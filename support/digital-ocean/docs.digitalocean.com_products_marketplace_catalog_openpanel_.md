# OpenPanel

Generated on 16 Jul 2024
from [the OpenPanel catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/openpanel)

OpenPanel is a powerful and flexible web hosting control panel for Linux systems.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanpejcic/OpenPanel/main/documentation/static/img/openpanel_admin.gif)

OpenPanel offers a distinct advantage over other hosting panels by providing each user with an isolated environment and tools to fully manage it. This ensures that your users enjoy full control over their environment, similar to a VPS experience. They can effortlessly install new PHP versions, modify server configurations, view domain logs, restart services, and perform numerous other advanced tasks.

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the OpenPanel 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB OpenPanel Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"openpanel"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying OpenPanel

First access via ssh: `ssh root@your_droplet_public_ipv4`

New admin account will automatically be created and you will see on terminal the login link, username and password.

Open the link in your browser: http://your\_droplet\_public\_ipv4:2087 and fill in the username / password.
