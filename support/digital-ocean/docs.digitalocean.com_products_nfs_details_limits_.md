# Network File Storage Limits

Validated on 13 Oct 2025 • Last edited on 20 Oct 2025

Network File Storage is a fully managed, POSIX-compliant file storage solution built for demanding workloads like AI/ML pipelines, containerized applications, and DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters. It provides scalable, high-throughput shared storage that simplifies storage management for distributed applications.

- Network File Storage shares must be at least 50 GiB and no more than 16,000 GiB.
- You can mount a share on up to 8 Droplets at once.
- You can only attach shares to one VPC network at a time.
- You can only move shares between VPC networks within the same datacenter.
- You can only mount shares on Droplets and DOKS clusters in the same VPC network.
  - You cannot mount shares across [VPC peering](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/how-to/create-peering/) connections.
  - You cannot mount shares across [Partner Network Connect](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/how-to/create-partner-attachment/) attachments.
- You can only create snapshots using API, not the control panel or command line.
- Each share can have up to 5 snapshots.
- Backups are not supported.
