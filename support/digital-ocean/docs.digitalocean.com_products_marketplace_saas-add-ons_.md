# DigitalOcean Marketplace SaaS Add-Ons

Validated on 10 Jan 2025 • Last edited on 17 Apr 2025

SaaS Add-Ons are third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings provided by external vendors.

SaaS Add-Ons expand the functionality and scalability of your existing infrastructure or applications with minimal setup requirements. Additionally, the automated maintenance and management provided by these Add-Ons further streamline the process.

SaaS Add-Ons include software license subscriptions. Instead of buying a license from a third-party vendor, you can purchase it directly through the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/) for use on your Droplets. As a vendors, you can [add licenses to their Droplet 1-Click apps in the vendor portal](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/vendorportal) and list them as a single Marketplace offering. You can also add licenses when [creating a Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/), so that the license is automatically included during deployment.
