**[SimpleBackups](https://simplebackups.com/?ref=do-addon)** automates all backups, snapshots, and cloud storage replication in a simple, secure, beautiful dashboard. You can use our API feature to take this automation further and manage backups from your own infrastructure.

You can set a custom schedule for your backups ( **file, database, snapshots**) or **cloud storage sync/replication** jobs and they will be taken automatically for you, and securely stored on your own storage cloud storage or mounted volume. Backups can be encrypted via **AES-256** using your own public key to ensure that no one else can read them.

SimpleBackups instantly notifies you when backups fail via Email, Webhooks, Slack, and/or Discord.
