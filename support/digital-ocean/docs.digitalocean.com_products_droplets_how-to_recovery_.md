# How to Recover Access or Data with the Droplet Recovery ISO and Recovery Console

Validated on 19 Jun 2018 • Last edited on 22 Nov 2024

DigitalOcean Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.

How to Recover Data from Droplets with the Recovery ISO

Use DigitalOcean’s recovery ISO with the Recovery Console to regain access to and perform data recovery operations on your Droplet, like getting access to an interactive shell, running fsck, or chrooting into the system.

How Recover Access to Droplets using the Recovery Console

Use the Recovery Console to recover access to a Droplet. It provides out-of-band access regardless of your network settings. It emulates the access you would have if you were sitting down with a keyboard and monitor attached to the actual server.
