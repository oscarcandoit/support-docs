# Kubescape operator

Generated on 13 Jun 2024
from [the Kubescape operator catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/kubescape-operator)

Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform. It includes runtime threat detection, security analysis, vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning. Targeted at the DevSecOps practitioner or platform engineer, it offers an easy-to-use CLI interface, flexible output formats, and automated scanning capabilities. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.

## Software Included

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kubescape](https://kubescape.io/) | 1.18.16 | [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to install a Kubernetes 1-Click Application. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters/new?addonslug=kubescape-operator&nodePools=s-1vcpu-2gb%3A3)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating Kubescape operator using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 3 node DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster made up of Basic Droplets in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `doctl` command. You need to authenticate with `doctl` with your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and replace the `$CLUSTER_NAME` variable with the chosen name for your cluster in the command below.

```shell
doctl kubernetes clusters create --size s-4vcpu-8gb $CLUSTER_NAME --1-clicks kubescape-operator
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Kubescape operator

Kubescape scan results can be accessed as Kubernetes API objects.
