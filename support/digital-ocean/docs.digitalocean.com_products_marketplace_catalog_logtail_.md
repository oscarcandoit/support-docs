# Logtail

Generated on 16 Oct 2023
from [the Logtail catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/logtail)

## Structured logging

[Logs & Telemetry](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/logtail/%3E) let you store logs in a structured form instead of a blob of text. You can do so much more with your logs than full-text search.

## SQL log querying

Query logs with the language your team already knows: SQL. No need to learn an obscure log querying language.

## Hosted Grafana dashboards

Number of user sessions over time? Average response time? You can chart it with a few clicks.

## Anomaly detection alerts

Configure presence/absence alerts. Configure custom Slack alerts based on the contents of your logs. Logs & Telemetry has a 1 click integration with [Better Stack Uptime](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/logtail/%3E) for easy on-call alerting and incident management.

## Secured

More secure than your self-hosted solution. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, stored in ISO/IEC 27001 certified data centers. Security of your data is our no. 1 priority.

## Team collaboration

Archive important log fragments, add comments and easily share links.

## Unbeatable price

We use a custom-built data pipeline for storing and processing your logs instead of relying on the Elastic/ELK stack as most logging services do. We pass the cost savings to you.

Logs & Telemetry is part of [Better Stack](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/logtail/%3E)
