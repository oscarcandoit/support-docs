# Reserved IPs

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Assign and reassign reserved IP addresses to Droplets as needed, or implement an automated failover mechanism with reserved IPs to build a high availability infrastructure.

BYOIP enables bringing your own block of IPv4 addresses to DigitalOcean. Once provisioned, assign your addresses to Droplets using the same interface and APIs as [Reserved IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/).


### 25 June 2025

- Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) is now in [public preview](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/product-lifecycle/#public-preview). BYOIP allows you to bring your own block of IPv4 addresses to DigitalOcean. Once provisioned, assign your addresses to Droplets using the same interface and APIs as [Reserved IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/).


### 17 June 2025

- Reserved IPv6 addresses are now in [general availability](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/product-lifecycle/#general-availability). Reserved IPv6 addresses are publicly-accessible static IPv6 addresses that you can assign to Droplets and instantly remap to other Droplets in the same datacenter. See [How to Create Reserved IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/how-to/create/) to get started.
