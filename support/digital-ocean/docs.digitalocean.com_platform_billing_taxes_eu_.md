# European Union Tax Information

Validated on 13 Dec 2024 • Last edited on 30 Jul 2025

As of 1 August 2015, DigitalOcean charges Value Added Tax (VAT) to customers with a tax location in The European Union.

This applies to all non-business European Union customers. VAT collected from customers in the European Union is paid to the tax authority of the appropriate EU member state.

You can access your VAT charges on your monthly invoice by visiting your team’s [Billing Page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/billing). DigitalOcean is registered for EU VAT under the Electronically Supplied Services (ESS) simplified VAT registration regime.

If you have a valid VAT ID in the European Union, you can [add it to your team](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings) to remove tax charges from your invoice. If you have a valid VAT ID but don’t add it to your team, your invoice includes tax charges.

Registered business may be required to manually account for this tax. If you do not see the VAT ID field on your billing page and you are an EU resident, [open a support ticket](https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/).

## European Union Tax Summary

The following table lists the VAT rates that may be charged to European Union customers. Prices listed on the DigitalOcean website do not include applicable VAT charges.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Taxes

### How is my tax location determined?

Your tax location is typically based on your account address, which is initially set to the payment address of your primary payment method when you sign up. In some locations, we are required by law to consider other account details, like other payment addresses or IP addresses.

### How can I change my tax location?

You can update your account address and view your account’s tax location and rate at any time on [the **Billing** page’s **Settings** tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing/settings). If you’ve set your account address correctly but your account’s tax location is not what you expect, [contact support for help](https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/).

### Why is my invoice in USD? Can I get an invoice in another currency?

USD is the only currency we accept for payments, so all invoices are in USD. We cannot provide invoices in other currencies. [Learn more about invoices](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/invoices/)
