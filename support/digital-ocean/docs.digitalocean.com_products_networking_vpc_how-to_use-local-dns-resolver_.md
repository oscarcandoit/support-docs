# How to Use the VPC-local DNS Resolver

Validated on 19 Nov 2025 • Last edited on 19 Nov 2025

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network interface for collections of DigitalOcean resources. VPC networks are inaccessible from the public internet and other VPC networks, and traffic on them doesn’t count against bandwidth usage. You can link VPC networks to each other using VPC peering connections.

DigitalOcean VPC networks provide an internal DNS resolver on the second-to-last IP address of the network. Configure your Droplets to use the internal resolver for better DNS performance and reliability on your DigitalOcean VPC network. This is especially important when using a NAT gateway, where multiple backend Droplets appear as one client to our DNS infrastructure and may be rate limited.

Note
Droplets created on or after 20 August 2025 automatically include the VPC-local DNS resolver along with the public resolvers (67.207.67.2 and 67.207.67.3). To exclusively use the VPC-local resolver, follow the steps below to [update your Droplet’s networking configuration](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/how-to/use-local-dns-resolver/#update-droplets).

To update your Droplets to use the internal DNS resolver, find the IP address of your resolver, then update your Droplet’s DNS resolution configuration to use the new IP address.

## Find a VPC Network’s Internal Resolver IP Address

A VPC network’s internal resolver IP address is always the second-to-last IP address of the network. To retrieve this IP address, use the DigitalOcean API or calculate it based on VPC network information shown in the control panel.

### Use the Control Panel to Find a VPC Network’s Internal Resolver IP Address

Go to the [**VPC**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/vpc) tab in the control panel and note the value shown in the **IP Range** column for your VPC network. It is an IPv4 address and network size is in CIDR format, like `10.116.0.0/20`.

Next, open to the [ARIN CIDR Calculator](https://account.arin.net/public/cidrCalculator). In the **Convert to IP Address Range** section, enter the following:

- **Prefix**: The prefix is the IP address before the `/` slash.

- **Prefix Length**: The length is the number after the slash.


In the previous CIDR example, the prefix is `10.116.0.0` and the prefix length is `20`.

Next, click **Convert**. You can view the end IP address in **End IP Address**. Your resolver IP address is the end IP address, minus 1 from the last octet. For example, if your end IP is `10.136.255.255`, your resolver IP address is `10.136.255.254`.

Use the resolver IP address in the [next step](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/how-to/use-local-dns-resolver/#update-droplets) to reconfigure your Droplet.

### Use the DigitalOcean API to Find a VPC Network’s Internal Resolver IP Address

Send a `GET` request to the `/v2/vpcs` endpoint to list all of your team’s VPC networks. The following command pipes the API’s JSON response to `jq` which outputs only the VPC network name and resolver IP address:

```shell
curl -X GET \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/vpcs" \
    | jq -r '.vpcs[] | "\(.name):\t\(.resolver_ip)"'
```

Add a valid DigitalOcean API token to the environment variable `$DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN` before running the command.

The output is a list of VPC names and resolver IP addresses:

```
default-nyc2:	10.100.15.254
default-sgp1:	10.104.15.254
default-sfo3:	10.124.15.254
```

Find the resolver IP address for your VPC network and use it in the [next step](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/vpc/how-to/use-local-dns-resolver/#update-droplets) to reconfigure your Droplet.

## Update Droplets to Use the VPC-local DNS Resolver

Update your Droplet’s networking configuration to use the VPC-local DNS resolver. This configuration procedure varies between different Linux distributions.

Ubuntu, Debian

Ubuntu and Debian use Netplan to configure networking, and `systemd-resolved` to manage DNS resolution. You must update both systems to configure your Droplet to use its VPC-local DNS resolver.

First, update the DigitalOcean-specific `systemd-resolved` configuration file at `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/DigitalOcean.conf`:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/DigitalOcean.conf
```

Replace the two default IP addresses with your single VPC-local DNS resolver IP address:

```ini
[Resolve]
DNS=<your-resolver-ip>
```

Replace `<your-resolver-ip>` with the actual resolver IP address you retrieved in the previous section.

Save and close the file, then restart `systemd-resolved`:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

Next, update the Netplan configuration file that cloud-init generated at first boot:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Remove all the lines highlighted below, from `nameservers:` to `search: []`. These lines define interface-specific name servers that are not necessary.

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      match:
        macaddress: "ce:68:83:13:e9:dd"
      addresses:
      - "159.203.129.109/20"
      - "10.17.0.6/16"
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 67.207.67.3
        - 67.207.67.2
        search: []
      set-name: "eth0"
      mtu: 1500
      routes:
      - to: "0.0.0.0/0"
        via: "159.203.128.1"
    eth1:
      match:
        macaddress: "ea:a8:49:d0:7c:09"
      addresses:
      - "10.132.1.108/16"
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 67.207.67.3
        - 67.207.67.2
        search: []
      set-name: "eth1"
      mtu: 1500
```

Save and close the file, then apply the changes:

```shell
sudo netplan apply
```

Use `resolvectl` to display the status of DNS resolution on your system:

```shell
sudo resolvectl status
```

The output shows that the VPC-local DNS server is set as the only available DNS server in the **Global** section:

```
Global
         Protocols: +LLMNR -mDNS -DNSOverTLS DNSSEC=no/unsupported
  resolv.conf mode: stub
       DNS Servers: 10.132.255.254

Link 2 (eth0)
    Current Scopes: LLMNR/IPv4 LLMNR/IPv6
         Protocols: -DefaultRoute +LLMNR -mDNS -DNSOverTLS DNSSEC=no/unsupported
     Default Route: no

Link 3 (eth1)
    Current Scopes: LLMNR/IPv4 LLMNR/IPv6
         Protocols: -DefaultRoute +LLMNR -mDNS -DNSOverTLS DNSSEC=no/unsupported
     Default Route: no
```

Rocky Linux, CentOS

Rocky Linux and CentOS define DNS resolvers in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. The following command uses `echo` to replace the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` with a single `nameserver <your-resolver-ip>` configuration line:

```shell
echo "nameserver <your-resolver-ip>" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

Replace `<your-resolver-ip>` with the actual resolver IP address you retrieved in the previous section.

Fedora

Fedora configures DNS resolvers in NetworkManager configuration files in the directory `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`. On a DigitalOcean Droplet, this directory has one file for each interface: `cloud-init-ens3.nmconnection` and `cloud-init-ens4.nmconnection`.

Use `nano` or another text editor to update the `dns=` line in both files:

```ini
dns=<your-resolver-ip>
```

Replace `<your-resolver-ip>` with the actual resolver IP address you retrieved in the previous section.

Restart NetworkManager to apply the changes:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

Your system is now configured to use its VPC-local DNS resolver. Use the `dig` command to verify DNS resolution is functioning properly.
