# Plesk (AlmaLinux)

Generated on 8 Oct 2025
from [the Plesk (AlmaLinux) catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/plesk-almalinux)

Plesk Obsidian (new!) is the leading secure WordPress and website management platform providing you with a simple yet performant and scalable platform developed for modern website hosting.

With Plesk on DigitalOcean you get access to a modern and lightweight stack to build, secure, and run websites and applications through one intuitive browser-based interface.

**New**: To upgrade Plesk, you can now purchase a license for Plesk [right here](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/plesk-licenses) on DigitalOcean!

[Free Udemy Course: Make WordPress Hosting Easy with Plesk on DigitalOcean](https://www.udemy.com/make-wordpress-hosting-easy-with-plesk-on-digitalocean/)

- **Host & manage your Websites and Applications**

Easily install, manage and operate WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, Prestashop - or your own custom website or application. For yourself or for your customers.

- **One Dashboard**

Build and manage multiple sites from a single dashboard. You can also run updates, monitor performance and onboard new prospects all from the same place.

- **Robust Site & Server Security**

Broad security by default across OS, network and apps. Firewall, Fail2ban and WAF bundled and activated by default.

- **Integrated with the DigitalOcean DNS**

Keep your domains and websites in sync with Plesk through the DigitalOcean DNS integration available at few clicks.

- **The Ultimate Toolkit for WordPress Sites**

One platform to install, update and remove instances, themes & plugins. Built-in security, sync and backup/restore features. Optional staging/cloning environments ( [Pro and Host editions only - click to compare](https://www.plesk.com/upgrade)).

- **Complete Flexibility and Control**

You get full root access via SSH on every Plesk-powered VPS so you can install any third-party, open source, or customized application you need.

- **Light Core, expandable with 100+ Extensions**

Do more with your platform as you integrate tools like DigiCert SSL, Speed Kit, Node.js, Let’s Encrypt SSL, Git, ImunifyAV, Backup to Cloud Pro and more.

- **Manage email for all Domains**

Plesk comes with a full-fledged email server included. Manage multiple users and mailboxes per domain. Or offer email hosting to your customers. **Note: to set up your reverse DNS record required to run an email service, please contact the DigitalOcean Support.**

- **Upgrade to the full unlimited Plesk Editions**

Single click in-app upgrade to premium features including staging, cloning, reseller management and more or through [https://www.plesk.com/upgrade](https://www.plesk.com/upgrade)

- **Plesk Droplet/VM Size Requirements**

Plesk runs smoothly with 1GB RAM and 1 vCPU for smaller websites and environments. Running multiple websites or higher traffic require a larger droplet size. **We recommend 2 CPU cores and 4GB RAM for the best performance**. [Please also refer to the Plesk Infrastructure Requirements for details.](https://docs.plesk.com/release-notes/obsidian/hardware-requirements/#s2)


## Software Included

_This Marketplace listing does not include a detailed software list._

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=plesk-pleskalmalinux)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the Plesk (AlmaLinux) 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB Plesk (AlmaLinux) Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"plesk-pleskalmalinux"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying Plesk (AlmaLinux)

### **To log in to Plesk for the first time using SSH keys:**

See the video instruction: [https://youtu.be/bltBv9EdEIs](https://youtu.be/bltBv9EdEIs).

1. Connect to your server (`your_droplet_public_ipv4`) via SSH using your preferred SSH client, or open the [Droplet Console](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-console/#access-the-droplet-console) directly from DigitalOcean.
2. Once connected, run the following command: `sudo plesk login`
3. The command will generate a one-time login link. Copy this link and open it in your web browser. You will be redirected to the Plesk without needing to enter a username or password.

**Note:** If you log in to a Plesk instance that is still being deployed, you will see the maintenance screen. Once the deployment is finished, the maintenance screen will be gone and you will be able to start using Plesk.

For more details, see [the official documentation](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/deployment-guide/plesk-installation-and-upgrade-on-public-cloud-services/installing-plesk-on-digitalocean.79699/).

### Next steps

Your Plesk is completely ready to work and you can start adding your first domain. However, we recommend that you also make the following steps:

- [Set up DNS hosting in DigitalOcean DNS](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/deployment-guide/plesk-installation-and-upgrade-on-public-cloud-services/installing-plesk-on-digitalocean.79699/#setting-up-dns-hosting).
- [Assign a floating IP address to your droplet](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/deployment-guide/plesk-installation-and-upgrade-on-public-cloud-services/installing-plesk-on-digitalocean.79699/#assigning-floating-ip-addresses).
