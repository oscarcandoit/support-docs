# How to Destroy Spaces

Validated on 26 Aug 2019 • Last edited on 16 Apr 2025

Spaces Object Storage is an S3-compatible service for storing and serving large amounts of data. The built-in Spaces CDN minimizes page load times, improves performance, and reduces bandwidth and infrastructure costs.

Destroying a Spaces bucket permanently and irrecoverably destroys the bucket and all of its objects. When you confirm the destruction of your last bucket, your Spaces subscription ends automatically and you are no longer charged.

To destroy a bucket, click its name on [the Spaces page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces) to go to its detail page, then click the **Settings** tab.

![The Spaces settings tab](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/spaces/settings.b113b745e7ef4472bcc683e4f75e4750ddec170083760bee2cb1d9bc215b249d.png)

In the **Destroy this Space** section, click **Destroy** to open the **Destroy Space** configuration window. Enter the name of the bucket and click **Destroy** to confirm.

When you confirm the destruction, the bucket goes into a pending destruction stage. The bucket remains listed in the control panel with an estimated time of destruction, and it is greyed out so you can’t view its overview page or open its **More** menu.

![A Spaces page with two buckets, one of which is scheduled for destruction](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/spaces/scheduled-destruction.2da0df1022e48d5e52c292a7c6bc7483865e54d94134cb89bbb7a92c5bce993f.png)

The bucket’s scheduled destruction time is 2 weeks or more, depending on the size of the bucket. While a bucket is pending destruction, you cannot use it, it no longer counts towards your billing charges, and you cannot reuse its name.

To cancel the destruction and regain access to your bucket, click **Cancel Deletion** before the scheduled deletion time.
