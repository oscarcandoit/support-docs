# QuantRocket

Generated on 28 Jan 2025
from [the QuantRocket catalog page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/quantrocket)

QuantRocket is a Python-based platform for researching, backtesting, and trading quantitative strategies. It provides a JupyterLab environment, offers a suite of data integrations, and supports multiple backtesters: Zipline, the open-source backtester that originally powered Quantopian; Alphalens, an alpha factor analysis library; Moonshot, a vectorized backtester based on pandas; and MoonshotML, a walk-forward machine learning backtester. Built on Docker, QuantRocket can be deployed locally or to the cloud and has an open architecture that is flexible and extensible.

## Software Included

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker CE | 27.5.1 | Apache 2 |
| QuantRocket | 2.11.0 | [Terms of Service](https://www.quantrocket.com/terms) |

## Creating an App using the Control Panel

Click the **Deploy to DigitalOcean** button to create a Droplet based on this 1-Click App. If you aren’t logged in, this link will prompt you to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=quantrocket)

## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the QuantRocket 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB QuantRocket Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"quantrocket"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying QuantRocket

Once the QuantRocket One-Click Droplet is created, you can log into it as root. Make sure to substitute the Droplet’s public IPv4 address.

```
$ ssh root@your_droplet_public_ipv4
```

Docker and QuantRocket are already installed on the droplet, but QuantRocket will not yet be running. To run QuantRocket, please visit the [cloud installation tutorial](https://www.quantrocket.com/installation/cloud/) and complete the installation steps, beginning with the section titled “Setup Domain”.
