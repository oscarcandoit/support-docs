# Projects Features

Validated on 18 Apr 2024 • Last edited on 18 Apr 2024

Projects let you organize your DigitalOcean resources into groups that fit the way you work. Create projects that align with the applications, environments, and clients that you host on DigitalOcean.

Projects are a high-level organizational tool designed to make it easier to focus and navigate the control panel when your infrastructure scales. Using projects lets you sort resources into groups that match what you use those resources for. You can separate resources for different applications, work for different clients, or development and production environments.

All of your resources start in a single default project. You can move resources between projects in bulk or one at a time, and you can populate new projects when you create them.

## Types of Resources

There are three types of resources:

| Project-Based Resources | Droplet-Based Resources | Independent Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Must belong to a project_ | _Belong to projects via associated Droplet_ | _Cannot interact with projects_ |
| Droplets | Attached volumes | Unattached volumes |
| Spaces | Backups | Tags |
| Load balancers | Snapshots | Firewall rules |
| Domains | Reserved IPs | Alert policies |
| DOKS clusters |  | VPCs |
| App Platform apps |  |  |

Project-based resources form the foundation of a project. All project-based resources must belong to a project, and you can directly assign them to one. If you create a project-based resource without a project specified, we add it to your default project.

Droplet-based resources are related to projects via the Droplet they’re associated with. You can access these resources from within a project through their associated Droplet.

Independent resources do not interact with projects.
