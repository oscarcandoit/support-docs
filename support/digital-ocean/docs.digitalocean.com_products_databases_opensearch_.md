## Latest Updates

### 17 September 2025

- Now in public preview, you can now enable storage autoscaling on all Managed Database engines. To enable autoscaling, see our resizing guides for [MySQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/resize/), [PostgreSQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/how-to/resize/), [MongoDB](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mongodb/how-to/resize/), [OpenSearch](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/opensearch/how-to/resize/), and [Kafka](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/kafka/how-to/resize/).

- Storage autoscaling is now in general availability. Additionally, you can now reduce your cluster’s amount of additional storage, as long as the new storage size is greater than or equal to the latest backup’s size plus any data growth since then and a 25% buffer.


### 28 February 2025

- All managed databases except MongoDB now support up to 2,000 IP addresses as trusted sources. To add trusted sources, see our guides for [MySQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/secure/), [PostgreSQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/how-to/secure/), [Caching](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/redis/how-to/secure/), [MongoDB](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mongodb/how-to/secure/), [OpenSearch](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/opensearch/how-to/secure/), and [Kafka](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/kafka/how-to/secure/).


### 20 December 2024

- All Managed Databases are [now available in NYC2](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/regional-availability/).
