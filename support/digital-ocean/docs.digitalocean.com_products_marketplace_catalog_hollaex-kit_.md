## Creating an App using the API

In addition to creating a Droplet from the HollaEx Kit 1-Click App using the control panel, you can also use the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api). As an example, to create a 4GB HollaEx Kit Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following `curl` command. You need to either save your [API access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to an environment variable or substitute it in the command below.

```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
        '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"hollaex-hollaexkit"}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

## Getting Started After Deploying HollaEx Kit

1. Register and configure your exchange at [https://dash.hollaex.com](https://dash.hollaex.com/).
2. SSH into your Droplet by running `ssh root@your_droplet_public_ipv4`.
3. Run `cd hollaex-kit` to go to the HollaEx Kit directory.
4. Go to the [official docs](https://docs.hollaex.com/get-started/setup#exchange-server-initialization) and follow the rest of the steps.
5. 🎨🚀💱📈🤑
