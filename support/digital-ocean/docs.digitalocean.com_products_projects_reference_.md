# Projects Reference

Validated on 5 Apr 2024 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

Projects let you organize your DigitalOcean resources into groups that fit the way you work. Create projects that align with the applications, environments, and clients that you host on DigitalOcean.

The [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/) lets you manage resources programmatically with standard HTTP requests. All actions available in the control panel are also available through the API.

You can use the API to [create, delete, and manage projects](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Projects).

### The DigitalOcean Command Line Client, doctl

[`doctl`](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) is the command-line interface for the DigitalOcean API. It supports most of the same actions available in the API and DigitalOcean Control Panel.

[`doctl`](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) supports managing projects from the command line. See the [`doctl` documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/projects/) or use `doctl projects --help` for more information.
