# How to Manage Payment Methods on DigitalOcean

Validated on 29 Aug 2025 • Last edited on 29 Aug 2025

You can [add](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/manage-payment-methods/#add), [edit](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/manage-payment-methods/#edit), and [delete](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/manage-payment-methods/#delete) your team’s payment methods on [the **Billing** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing) in the **Payment methods** section.

To create resources or invite additional team members, you need to add a payment method to your team.

## Accepted Payment Methods

DigitalOcean accepts the following payment methods:

- **Credit and debit cards**. We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, UnionPay, Diners Club, and JCB credit cards.

Credit and debit cards from India need to be enabled for international transactions. Cards issued by Citibank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, IndusInd Bank, RBL Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are less likely to be declined than other banks.

- **Third-party providers**, like PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Alipay, and Link.

- **ACH direct debit** for qualifying customers with U.S. bank accounts.


We do not accept virtual, electron, or prepaid cards.

When you have more than one payment method saved to your team, the first one you add becomes the default payment method, and any additional payment methods you add are marked as backups. We charge your default payment method automatically each billing cycle. You can [update your default payment method](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/manage-payment-methods/#default) at any time.

## Adding a Payment Method

To add a new payment method, from [the **Billing** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing), go to the **Payment Methods** section.

Click **Add payment method** to open the **Add a new payment method** window.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/billing/add-new-payment-method.ff4caea924d37ea2cdb55c5b37161572532e4ba90278c6ea400b42dd32f4437f.png)

Credit Card

Click **Card** to add a credit card. In the window that opens, enter the card information and click **Create**.

We may send a preauthorization request to the issuing bank to verify that the bank issued the card and can authorize charges. These temporary preauthorization holds may appear on your statement for up to 7 days, but you are not being charged and no funds are being transferred from your card or account to DigitalOcean.

PayPal

Click **PayPal** to connect your PayPal account.

When you connect a PayPal account, you choose a payment method from PayPal and allow a $5 authorization charge. This verifies the payment method for use on DigitalOcean.

Google Pay

Click **Google Pay** to connect your Google Pay account.

Note
The Google Pay option only appears if you are using a Chromium-based browser, like Chrome, Brave, or Microsoft Edge. If this option isn’t visible and you expected it to be, follow our instructions on [troubleshooting Google Pay](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/why-dont-i-see-google-pay-as-a-payment-option/).

When you connect a Google Pay account, you choose a payment method from Google Pay and allow a $0 authorization charge. This verifies the payment method for use on DigitalOcean.

Apple Pay

Click **Apple Pay** to connect your Apple Pay account.

Note
The Apple Pay option only appears if you are using the Safari browser. If this option isn’t visible and you expected it to be, follow our instructions on [troubleshooting Apple Pay](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/why-dont-i-see-apple-pay-as-a-payment-option/).

When you connect an Apple Pay account, you choose a payment method from Apple Pay and allow a $0 authorization charge. This verifies the payment method for use on DigitalOcean.

Alipay

Click **Alipay** to connect your Alipay account.

When you connect an Alipay account, you choose a payment method from Alipay and allow a $0 authorization charge. This verifies the payment method for use on DigitalOcean.

Link

Click **Secure, fast checkout with Link** to connect a Link account.

You can log into an existing Link account to access credit cards you’ve saved to your Link wallet. Alternatively, you can create a new Link account by entering an email address and phone number, then entering your payment method information.

Once your Link account is created and authenticated, you can choose any payment methods associated with your Link account when you make a payment on DigitalOcean. In the **Payment Methods** section, payment methods you have added via Link display **Powered by Link**.

Bank Account (ACH)

Before setting up ACH direct debit on DigitalOcean, we strongly recommend [providing Stripe’s company IDs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ach-direct-debit-company-ids-for-stripe) to your bank. Stripe explains:

> \[S\]ome business bank accounts may have filters in place to deny debits from unknown entities. To allow Stripe to debit from or deposit into your (or your customer’s) account on your behalf, Stripe’s ACH company IDs must be provided to the bank to ensure ACH transactions will be processed.
>
> In some cases, a debit that is attempted on such an account without providing Stripe’s ACH company IDs will result in an unexpected dispute. When this happens, the bank account may also become blocked for use with Stripe.

To connect a bank account for ACH direct debit payments, click **US bank account**. You can instantly verify your bank using OAuth.

Alternatively, you can manually enter your bank details. When you manually enter details, in the next few business days, we make two small micro-deposits to your bank account. Within ten days of receiving them, you must verify your bank account by entering the micro-deposit amounts either on the DigitalOcean billing page or on the Stripe page via the link we email to you.

Once you add a bank account, ACH direct debit becomes the default payment method on your team. To change the default payment method, you need to remove the bank account as a payment method.

## Setting a Default Payment Method

To choose a new default payment method, open the **…** menu of the backup payment method you want to set as the default, then click **Set as Default**.

In the **Update Primary Payment Method** window that opens, click **Update** to confirm.

## Editing a Payment Method

To update the information for a saved payment method, open the **…** menu of the payment method, then click **Update card** to open the **Edit Card** window.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/billing/edit-card.53112089721e1a75d646e48d3ecbf82258c1e38b75a5d097a6ca16509026c0d3.png)

Update the information you want to change, then click **Update Card Information**.

## Deleting a Payment Method

To remove a saved payment method, click the **…** menu of the payment method, then click **Delete**. In the **Confirm Delete Card** window that opens, click **Delete** to remove the card. You cannot remove the default payment method on the team.

## Help with Payments

For help with payments, see the following support articles:

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Can I have a refund?

We do not offer refunds.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

What if I'm unable to pay my invoice?

We do not offer extensions, but we can help you find other solutions.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

Why was my card declined?

Your card may be declined for a number of reasons, including banking restrictions, unavailable funds, or trying to use a prepaid card.

![](https://docs.digitalocean.com/images/icons/support.svg)

I've paid my bill so why aren't my services online?

Once you pay a past-due balance, you need to manually turn your resources (like Droplets) back on using the control panel.
