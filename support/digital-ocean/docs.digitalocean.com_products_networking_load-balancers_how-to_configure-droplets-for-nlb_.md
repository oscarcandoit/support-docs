# How to Configure Backend Droplets for Network Load Balancers

Validated on 12 Aug 2025 • Last edited on 3 Sep 2025

DigitalOcean fully manages Regional Load Balancers and Global Load Balancers, ensuring they are highly available load balancing services. Load balancers distribute traffic to groups of backend resources in specific regions or across different regions, which prevents the health of a service from depending on the health of a single server, cluster, or region.

Network load balancers route traffic at the network transport level, based on IP addresses and ports. You must update the network configuration of all backend Droplets to properly handle this traffic.

## Find the Load Balancer IP Address

First, find the IP address of your network load balancer. The address is listed on [the **Load Balancers** page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/load_balancers) in the control panel, or [use `doctl`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) to retrieve it with the following command:

```shell
doctl compute load-balancer list --format Name,IP
```

This outputs a table with load balancer names and IP addresses:

```
Name                       IP
nyc3-load-balancer-01      203.0.113.67
global-load-balancer-01
network-load-balancer      203.0.113.2
```

Note
IPv6 network load balancers require IPv6-enabled backend Droplets. Read [How to Enable IPv6 on Droplets](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/ipv6/how-to/enable/) to enable IPv6 if necessary.

Note the correct load balancer IP address to use in the next steps.

## Add a Route for the Load Balancer IP Address

Log in to your backend Droplet using SSH or the console. Run the `ip route add` command to add a route to the kernel’s IP routing table, using the IP address you retrieved in the previous step. Use `eth0` for `<your_interface>` if the load balancer is public, and `eth1` if it’s a private, internal-only load balancer:

```shell
ip route add to local <your_loadbalancer_ip> dev <your_interface>
```

Remember to replace `<your_loadbalancer_ip>` with the correct IP address.

This command creates a routing rule that directs traffic for the load balancer IP to the local system, regardless of its actual source. The system claims ownership of the IP address on the specified interface, ensuring that any incoming packets for the IP address are processed by the local machine, and any services listening on the IP address can handle this traffic.

**For private, internal load balancers only**, you must also configure Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) announcements on the `eth1` interface. Use `sysctl` to set `net.ipv4.conf.eth1.arp_announce` to `2`:

```shell
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth1.arp_announce=2
```

Your Droplet can now handle traffic from the load balancer. Wait for the load balancer health checks to pass before testing connectivity.

The `ip route` and `sysctl` configuration changes do not persist across reboots. The next step shows how to configure systemd to run the commands during the boot process.

## Make the Route Permanent

There are many different ways to run the network configuration commands automatically when your Droplet boots. To do so with systemd, set up a systemd unit file.

First, open the file with `nano` or your preferred text editor:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/configure-nlb.service
```

Paste in the following, remembering to replace `<your_loadbalancer_ip>` with the correct IP address, and `<your_interface>` with `eth0` for public load balancers or `eth1` for private:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Configure Network Load Balancer
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/sbin/ip route add to local <your_loadbalancer_ip> dev <your_interface>
#ExecStart=/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth1.arp_announce=2
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you’re configuring a private load balancer, uncomment the `ExecStart=/sbin/sysctl ...` command by removing the `#` at the beginning of the line.

Save the file and quit your editor to return to the command prompt.

Use `systemctl` to enable and start the `configure-nlb` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable configure-nlb
sudo systemctl start configure-nlb
```

You can check the status of the service with `systemctl status`:

```shell
sudo systemctl status configure-nlb
```

The output should show `enabled` and `active (exited)`. The routing changes are now persistent across system reboots.
