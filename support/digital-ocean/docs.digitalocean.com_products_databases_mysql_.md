# MySQL

Generated on 25 Nov 2025

MySQL is an open source, object-relational database built with speed and reliability in mind. Its large and active developer community has created many third-party applications, tools, and libraries that expand MySQL’s functionality.

## Latest Updates

### 17 September 2025

- Now in public preview, you can now enable storage autoscaling on all Managed Database engines. To enable autoscaling, see our resizing guides for [MySQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/how-to/resize/), [PostgreSQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/how-to/resize/), [MongoDB](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mongodb/how-to/resize/), [OpenSearch](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/opensearch/how-to/resize/), and [Kafka](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/kafka/how-to/resize/).

- Storage autoscaling is now in general availability. Additionally, you can now reduce your cluster’s amount of additional storage, as long as the new storage size is greater than or equal to the latest backup’s size plus any data growth since then and a 25% buffer.


### 1 July 2025

- The DOKS database operator, which facilitated integration of DOKS clusters with managed databases, is deprecated. Your existing databases remain operational and the [operator-related CRDs](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/tree/main/docs/databases) are not removed. You can use the DigitalOcean API, CLI, or control panel to manage the databases created with the operator.


### 19 March 2025

- We have released new Storage-Optimized Droplet plans for MySQL and PostgreSQL with 48 CPUs, 384 GiB of RAM, and 20 TB (MySQL)/30 TB (PostgreSQL) of storage in SGP1, SFO2, and FRA1. For more details, see our pricing pages for [MySQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/details/pricing/) and [PostgreSQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/details/pricing/).
