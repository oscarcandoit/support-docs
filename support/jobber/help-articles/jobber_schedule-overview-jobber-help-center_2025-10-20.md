### Overview

To give you flexibility in how you view your work, there are 5 different schedule views on Jobber.com. Each of these schedule views visualizes your upcoming appointments in different ways:

- **[Month and Week Views](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009164267)**\- These views show your schedule monthly or weekly. Schedule items are ordered on each day with anytime items listed first ordered alphabetically followed by scheduled items visits in order of their start time. Items in the unscheduled section are listed in order of their creation date.
- **[Day View](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009234787)**\- The day view is a look at one day of your schedule organized on a grid separated by the assigned user. Scrolling sideways on the grid shows additional hours throughout the day.
- [**Map View**](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009234307)\- The map view shows a list of all of your items for the day sorted into scheduled, anytime, and unscheduled. If your appointments are linked to a client and property then they will also appear as a map pin on the map to the right. The map view shows anytime visits listed in [routed order](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009542508).
- [**List View**](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009394808)\- Here you can see all the items from the schedule as a list. These items can be searched using the search bar, or sorted from the **Filters** button. Without any filters turned on, unscheduled  tasks will show at the top, overdue tasks next, then  upcoming tasks by date.

There are additional schedule views available in the Jobber mobile app. Learn more about [Schedule in the Jobber App](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/6766253760279).

There are different types of items that you'll see on the schedule. These show up in different colors and have different purposes. They are:

- **Visits:** show up in green. These are visits associated with jobs for clients. They can be assigned to users and marked complete.
- **[Tasks](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009404788):** show up in blue. tasks can be assigned to users and marked completed. They are not used for invoicing, so are great for in-house tasks.
- **[Events](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010161028):** show up in yellow. Events are seen by everyone on the team. They can be used for company wide reminders.
- **Reminders:** show up in red. These are used for [invoice reminders](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009517847) or reminders to follow up on a [quote](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009737088).
- **Requests:** show up in bronze. These are [requests](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009737048-Work-Requests) that have an on-site assessment scheduled. They can be assigned, so requests work well when you need to schedule someone to go out to a property to make a quote.

### Navigation

In the top right of the schedule beside the buttons for **Filter** and **More Actions**, there is a button that displays the name of the current schedule view you are looking at. This button is for navigating between different schedule views. Click it to jump to a different schedule view, such as the day, map, or list view.

In the top left of the schedule, there is a **Today** button as well as the date range of the week or month that you are viewing. To view a different week or month, click the date range, and from the date picker, select the time period you would like to view. ![Dropdown with a date picker with a monthly calendar view](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21897643693975)

Filter the tasks that show on the schedule using the **Filters** button in the top right. From the filter options, you can click on items to deselect them from appearing on the schedule. Deselected items will appear greyed out.

You can also add [calendar colors](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009378647) to differentiate items on your schedule.

![Schedule filter dropdown options](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21897643702039)

You can filter by:

- **Assigned to:** Filter by the user that items are assigned to.
- **Types:** Filter by types of schedule items such as tasks, visits, reminders, events, and requests. The daily visit count shows the number of visits you have on each day.
- **Status:** Filter by the status of the item on the schedule. Some schedule views show different statuses including unassigned, unscheduled, and without a property.
- **Title Matching:** Titles can be color coded in your [calendar colors settings,](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009378647) so that a keyword in a visit's title changes the color of the visit on the schedule.

  - **Note:** This is section acts as a legend to see which color is associated with which title. Clicking the titles from this section does not filter them on the schedule
- **Days:** Filter out weekends to only see Monday through Friday on the schedule.

When filters are turned on, the **Filters** button will show **Filters ON**. To clear filters and reveal all the items on your schedule, click **Filters > Clear Filters.**
