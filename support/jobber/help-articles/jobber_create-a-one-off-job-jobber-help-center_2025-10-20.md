### Overview

There are two kinds of jobs in Jobber, one-off jobs and [recurring jobs](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009542848). One-off jobs are used for:

- Jobs that have a single visit
- Jobs that have multiple visits and the client will be invoiced after the last visit. Eg. The job is four days long, and the client is invoiced after the last visit.

#### What’s New in Jobs

We’ve refreshed the Jobs experience in Jobber to make it easier, faster, and more intuitive for you to create and manage jobs. These updates will start appearing in your account automatically—no action needed.

**What’s changed with creating jobs**:

- New, cleaner look with a refreshed header style.
- Instructions field has moved—this is now located in the schedule section of the job creation screen.
- Smoother workflow for selecting clients and properties.
- Redesigned internal notes for clarity.
- A sticky save bar, so saving progress is always just a click away.
- Permissions update: Users without access to requests will no longer see request details when converting a quote to a job. Learn more about [user permissions](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009568687).

**Improvements to editing and viewing jobs**:

- Job View/Edit: Internal notes now live in the right sidebar, giving you more room to work.
- Edit job details directly on the page without opening new windows. Refreshed style for consistency with the Job Create page.

**Removed features:**

- “Base this Job off a Quote” has been retired, but don’t worry—quotes can still be converted to jobs with all line items and totals carrying over automatically.
- The calendar preview that was an option while creating your job schedule is being phased out and will soon be replaced by a built-in, interactive mini-schedule. This is not to be mistaken with the month view of the schedule, which is remaining a part of the [new schedule](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29840886387351).
- Some redundant details when converting quotes to jobs have been cleaned up to reduce clutter.

**Why this is better:**

- Faster workflows with less clicking and scrolling.
- More space to work with a simplified, modern interface.
- Clearer design that matches the rest of Jobber, making it easier to find what you need.

### How to create a one-off job

You can create a job from many places on Jobber.com, including:

- the **Create** button from the side navigation
- the **More Actions** button on schedule
- the **More Actions** button on a client’s profile
- or from the **New Job** button on [Home](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051851213)( [Dashboard](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033835353) for non-admin users).
- the **Convert to Job** button on an approved quote
- On requests, select the **More Actions** button, then select **Convert to job**

One-off jobs can also be created in the Jobber App. Learn more about [Jobs in the Jobber App](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/8185260991127).

![Image-42.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34786868313111)

#### Select a client and add job details

When creating a new job, start by filling in the job title in the **Title** field. This typically the name of the type of work you'll be doing. This will be visible as the name of your job on on your schedule in Jobber.com as well as on the Jobber mobile app. The job title will not show to the client and is often used as a description of the job that you will be doing.

Next, select a client. This is the person or company that you are providing these services to. To add a client, start typing in the **Select a client** field then choose a client from the list, or click **Create New Client** if they are not yet a client in your Jobber account. If you are [converting a request or a quote to a job](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056871013), the job will automatically be for the same client as the request or quote.

![Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 10.07.01 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34786868314903)

On the right of the job title and client name is the job details. This includes the job number and [salesperson](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/25806091364375). To change the job number, click **Change** then enter a new job number. Job numbers count upwards from the highest job number currently in your account. If your current highest job number is #123, the next job you make will default to #124.

If you have any job level [custom fields](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735928) set up, they can be filled out while creating the job. To add a new custom field (that will appear as a field on all job), select the **Add field** button.

#### Set up your schedule

To create a one-off job, make sure to select the **One-Off Job** tab from under **Job** **Type**.

![Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 11.35.14 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34786868316439)

Next, is setting up the schedule for this job. Since this is a recurring job, it will have a schedule with repeating visits.

At the top of the schedule section, you’ll see a quick reference showing how many visits will be created for this one-off job. It also displays the date of the first visit so you can easily confirm the details before saving.

1. To set the schedule for the job, select a **Start Date** for the job. To help with your scheduling there is a preview of the current month's schedule. Select **Show Calendar** or **Hide Calendar** to view or remove the preview. Select **Schedule later** to create an unscheduled job.
2. Select **start** and **end times** for your visits. If no time is selected, the visit(s) for this job will be anytime visits.

Once the start date and times are filled out, if you are using arrival windows you'll see a section for **Arrival windows** appear with the duration that was set in your [work settings](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009737088).

Learn more about [arrival windows](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/13004689565463).

If you aren't sure yet when you'll be doing this job, check the box for **Schedule later**. This will create a job in "unscheduled" status. This will create an unscheduled visit that you can later schedule when you're ready to begin this work.
3. Click **Assign** to add team members who will be assigned to the visits for this job. If no users are selected, the visits will be unassigned and can be assigned later. Learn [How to Remind your Team about their Assignments](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002245142).
4. Click the **Job forms** heading to add job forms to this job. [Job forms](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009740048) attached at the job level will add job forms to all the visits for this job. Job forms are customizable checklists and forms that can be attached to jobs so your team can fill them out in the field. Job forms are a good way of collecting information while on a visit and standardizing the way information is entered when different employees are filling out the forms.
5. Select if the job **Repeats**. This is how often you'll be going out to visit the client as part of this job.

   - "Does not repeat" is the default for one-off jobs.
   - Visits can repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or on a custom schedule. The custom schedule gives you flexibility to schedule weekly, monthly, or annually. You can also select multiple days. For example, you could use the custom schedule to schedule weekly visits on Mondays and Wednesday. Or you could use it to set monthly visits on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of the month.
   - The “As Needed We Won’t Prompt You” option is for if you don’t want to schedule visits on this job right now. If you select this option, visits won't be created for this job however can be created later.
6. The **Instructions** field is where you can add directions for your team for this job. This field is internal so your client won't see the instruction, but they'll carry forward onto all visits for this job so that your team knows what to do when they get there. Instructions for a particular visit can be edited from the schedule. Editing the instructions on the visit changes the instructions for that particular visit only.

### Set up your invoicing schedule

By default, **Remind me to invoice when I close the job** is selected. With this option, when the job is closed an [invoice reminder](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009517847) will be generated. An active invoice reminder is what puts a job into "requires invoicing" status and allows you to batch invoice this job.

If you do not want to invoice for this job through Jobber, uncheck this box. When completed, the job will then go into "archived" status and you won't be prompted to invoice for this job.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.42.59 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357254695831)

### Add your line items, labor, and expenses

This section of the job includes:

#### Profit bar

The profit bar appears on one-off jobs on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/) as part of Jobber's [job costing](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/14343244961175) feature. To minimize the profit bar, select **Hide Profitability**.

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 at 11.45.38 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357227971351)

#### Line items

These are the products or services you are offering on this job. Line items can be selected from your [products and services list](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735848), or added as a custom line item for this job.

To add a new line item to this job, select **Edit**, then scroll to the Product / Service section and select **New Line Item**.

![Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 11.44.56 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34786868318999)

**Note**: A job can support up to 100 line items.

Next add your line items to the job. These are the products or services you are offering on this job. Line items can be selected from your products and services list, or added as a custom line item for this job.

For each line item, enter a:

- **Name:** The name of the product or service.
- **Description:** A description of the product or service.
- **Quantity:** How many of this item you're offering.
- **Unit cost ($):** The expenses you incur to provide a product or service. This option is available on select plans as part of our markup functionality. [Learn more about our current pricing](https://getjobber.com/pricing/).
- **Unit price ($):** The amount you charge customers for a  product or service.
- **Total:** This is calculated automatically based on the quantity and unit price for this item.

![Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 11.46.17 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34786868320919)

**Note:** If there is a visit where you need to add additional line items (maybe you require an extra product or are providing an additional service), for one-off jobs these additional line items must be added to the job rather than the visit.

The total of the line items will create the subtotal, then the property's tax rate will be added to create a total for this job. When a quote with a required deposit is converted to a job, the deposit information will be visible when creating or editing the job. The deposit information does not appear on the saved job, only the create or edit screen.

![Screenshot 2024-07-17 at 11.29.55 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/24975577471127)

#### Labor

These are the time entries for your team members who have logged time towards this job. Time entries for this job can be created using the [timers in the Jobber mobile app](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/7447924360855) or from Jobber.com by selecting **New Time Entry** from this job, or from the **Time Sheets** [tab on the side navigation](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009543028).

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.51.40 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357228008343)

#### Expenses

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.51.46 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357254793239)

#### Job costing

When running a business, it's important to understand your profitability. There are many factors that go into making a profit, including your pricing, labor costs, and expenses. To make sure that you are staying on track, job costing is available on one-off jobs where you can see your profit margin, profit, and total price.

Job costing is available on the [Grow Plan](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050124513).[View our current pricing plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/).

To check what plan you're on, navigate to the **Gear Icon > Account and Billing**. If you have any questions about your plan's features or pricing, our [support team is here to help](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008966513)!

Your profitability is calculated using:

- Timesheets - based on the hourly cost of your employees and their time worked on a job
- Line items - including both unit costs and unit prices
- Expenses - these are the expenses logged on a job

Job costs are internal, so your clients won't see your profits or costs. Only employees with job costing permissions will be able to view the profit bar on one-off jobs.

On one-off jobs, there is a section that includes your line items, timesheets, and expenses which is what makes up the the calculation for your job profitability. At the top of this section is your "profit bar" which shows:

- Profit margin % (calculated by profit / revenue \* 100)
- Total price (This is your revenue, calculated as the sum of the line items on the job. This is pre-tax and excludes discounts)
- Total line item costs (This is the total of the line item costs, ie. the cost that _you_ pay for a product or what a service costs you)
- Total timesheets costs (these are your labor costs)
- Total expense costs (these are expenses associated with this job)
- Profit (revenue - total costs)
- A visualization of the line item cost, labor, expenses, and profit

These calculations are for this job only.

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 at 11.45.38 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357227971351)

To populate the profit bar, click **Calculate Profitability**. Note that this will not add labor costs or line item costs to the profit bar as these values did not exist before May 4, 2023 when job costing was introduced into Jobber. You can manually edit the costs for the job to add them in.

To minimize the profit bar, click **Hide Profitability**. When hidden, to view the profit bar, click **Show Profitability**.

[Learn more about Job Costing](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/14343244961175)

### Add internal notes and attachments

You can also add notes, photos, or attachments for your team to see in the **Internal notes & attachments** section. Clients cannot see these notes.

![Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 10.09.11 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34793734985495)

Learn more about [internal notes and attachments](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000110368).

### Save the job

Lastly, make sure you save the job! When creating a new job, there are two save buttons:

- **Save job** will save this job and then take you of of the edit screen, back to the top of the job so you can look over the changes you have made.
- **Save and...** has a menu with options to save the job as well as another action, all in one click.
  - **Email booking confirmation** sends a [booking confirmation](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060143753) to the client via email.
  - **Text booking confirmation** sends a booking confirmation to the client via text message.
