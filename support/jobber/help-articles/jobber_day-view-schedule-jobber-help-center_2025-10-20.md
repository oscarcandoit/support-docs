![Day view of the schedule](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914778007)

**Unassigned** items will appear in a drawer on the right side of the grid, starting with items scheduled for the current date at a particular time, and then for anytime. Afterward, any **unscheduled** and unassigned items will be listed. This drawer can be expanded or hidden so you can view more of the grid at one time.

![Day view of the schedule with the unassigned drawer open](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898885482903)

**Assigned** visits are in the user's row. If the visit is scheduled at a time it will show in the grid under that time. If it is not assigned a time, or if it is unscheduled, it will appear in the any time section next to the user's name. Click the anytime column for each user to view what items are assigned to that user.

![list of users with numbers beside their names. One of the user's anytime/unscheduled appointments are visible](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914807831)

The following items can be found on the schedule grid shown with their designated colors. Calendar colors set up per employee won't appear since the grid already has employees separated out.

- **Visits:** show up in green. These are visits associated with jobs for clients. They can be assigned to users and marked complete.
- **Tasks:** show up in blue. [Tasks](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009404788) can be assigned to users and marked completed. They are not used for invoicing, so are great for in-house tasks.
- **Reminders:** show up in red. These are used for i [nvoice reminders](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009517847) or reminders to follow up on a quote.
- **Requests:** show up in bronze. These are [Work Requests](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009737048-Work-Requests) that have an on-site assessment scheduled. They can be assigned, so requests work well when you need to schedule someone to go out to a property to make a quote.

**Note:** [Events](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010161028) don't appear on the grid. Since events are automatically assigned to every user by default, they don't show on the gird to avoid cluttering the schedule.

### Navigate to the day view

In the top right of the grid beside the buttons for **Filter** and **More Actions**, there is a button that displays the name of the current schedule view you are looking at, so if you are viewing it from the day view, it will say **Day**. This button is for navigating between different schedule views. Click it to jump to a different schedule view, such as the month, week, map, or list view.

### ![schedule view dropdown selections of month, week, day, map, and list.](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914821655)

In the top left of the schedule, there is a **Today** button as well as the schedule date that you are viewing. To view a different day, click the date. This will open a date picker where you can select a new date to view on the day view.

![date selections from the map view](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914833815)

To jump back to the current date's day view, click **Today**.

### Filters and more actions from the day view

Items can be hidden from the schedule by using the filers. From the **Filters** button in the top right of your grid, click on items to deselect them from appearing on the schedule. Deselected items will appear greyed out.

Note: [Calendar colors](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009378647) do not show on the day view of the schedule

![filter menu expanded to show the day view filer options](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914838295)

You can filter by:

- **Assigned to:** Filter by the user that items are assigned to.
- **Types:** Filter by types of schedule items such as tasks, visits, reminders, events, and requests. The daily visit count shows the number of visits you have on each day.
- **Status:** Filter by the status of the item on the schedule. Some schedule views show different statuses including unassigned, unscheduled, and without a property.

When filters are turned on, the **Filters** button will show **Filters ON**. To clear filters and reveal all the items on your schedule, click **Filters > Clear Filters.**

**![day view filter options with an arrow pointing to the clear filters button](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914862231)**

The actions from the day view of the schedule are:

- Create a new job by clicking **Job**
- Create a new request by clicking **Request**
- Create a new task by clicking **Task**
- Create multiple visits for multiple clients at once using the [new visits tool](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012682348), by clicking**Visits**
- Move all visits from one day to another by clicking **Move Visits**
- View and download [day sheets](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009378627) by clicking **Day Sheets**

![more actions menu options expanded](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898885535767)

### Assigning a visit from the day view

To assign a task to a user, expand the unassigned drawer and select a visit. Drag it into the grid at the time you want it on user's row. To extend or shorten the task, click and drag the edge of the task. If the task doesn't have a time, you can drag it into the user's anytime bucket.

![unassigned visit being dragged from the unassigned drawer to a user in order to assign it](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/21898914875159)

### Edit an item from the day view

To make any edits to an item, click it from the grid. The client name and associated work info (job number, request date) is shown as a hyperlink in the **Details** box where clicking on the client name or job number will bring you to those specific pages. Click **Edit** or **View Details** at the bottom of the pop-up for more options. You will need to edit the task to be able to delete it.
