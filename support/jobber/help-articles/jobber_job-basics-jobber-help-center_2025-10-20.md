### Overview

Create a job, choose a client, and assign it to your team with only a few clicks. Scheduling in Jobber gives you the flexibility you need to book jobs, tasks, and events—faster.

In Jobber, creating a job is how you will populate your schedule with work, so let's get that calendar filled up. Using jobs you can create your schedule for when you will be doing the work, assign team members, set up the products and services you're offering, and create a schedule for when the client will be billed.

#### What’s New in Jobs

We’ve refreshed the Jobs experience in Jobber to make it easier, faster, and more intuitive for you to create and manage jobs. These updates will start appearing in your account automatically—no action needed.

**What’s changed with creating jobs**:

- New, cleaner look with a refreshed header style.
- Instructions field has moved—this is now located in the schedule section of the job creation screen.
- Smoother workflow for selecting clients and properties.
- Redesigned internal notes for clarity.
- A sticky save bar, so saving progress is always just a click away.
- Permissions update: Users without access to requests will no longer see request details when converting a quote to a job. Learn more about [user permissions](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009568687).

**Improvements to editing and viewing jobs**:

- Job View/Edit: Internal notes now live in the right sidebar, giving you more room to work.
- Edit job details directly on the page without opening new windows. Refreshed style for consistency with the Job Create page.

**Removed features:**

- “Base this Job off a Quote” has been retired, but don’t worry—quotes can still be converted to jobs with all line items and totals carrying over automatically.
- The calendar preview that was an option while creating your job schedule is being phased out and will soon be replaced by a built-in, interactive mini-schedule. This is not to be mistaken with the month view of the schedule, which is remaining a part of the [new schedule](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29840886387351).
- Some redundant details when converting quotes to jobs have been cleaned up to reduce clutter.

**Why this is better:**

- Faster workflows with less clicking and scrolling.
- More space to work with a simplified, modern interface.
- Clearer design that matches the rest of Jobber, making it easier to find what you need.

[Learn more about creating one-off jobs](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009379047)

[Learn more about creating recurring jobs](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009542848-Create-a-Recurring-Job)

### Jobs and visits

**Visits** are each time that you go out to a client's property to do work, whereas jobs are the whole duration of work or the whole contract.

There are two types of jobs in Jobber:

1. **One-Off Jobs**: Jobs with one visit, or multiple visits, but without a repeating schedule. (Eg. Spring clean up, move-out clean, HVAC repair), and one final invoice. [Learn how to set up a one-off job](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009379047).
2. **Recurring Jobs**: Jobs with multiple visits that are done periodically, or on a repeating schedule, with one or multiple invoices. (Eg. Weekly cleaning, snow removal, monthly lawn mowing). [Learn how to set up a recurring job](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009542848).

These jobs have different visit schedules, but one of the main differences between them is the _billing frequency_. One-off jobs are typically billed once at the end of the service, whereas recurring jobs will be billed multiple times such as after each visit, weekly, or monthly. Once a job is created, the job type cannot be switched. For example, a one-off job cannot later be switched to a recurring job. It would need to be recreated instead.

**Note**: It is not possible to merge jobs.

### Anatomy of a job

Below is an example of what a job will look like once created and an overview of what is in each section. The job shown below is an example of what a job might look like on the [Grow Plan](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050124513), including [job costing](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/14343244961175), [time tracking](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009543028), [expense tracking](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009615927), and [chemical tracking](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009615967).

To make changes to a job, select the **Edit** button.

![A screenshot showing all sections of a job page.](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317365912471)

#### **The job overview**

**![A screenshot showing the job overview section on a job page. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317344980247)**

This section includes high level details about the job including:

- **Job status**
- **Client name**
- **Job title**

This will show up as the title of the job in your schedule (according the default visit title settings in your [Work Settings](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009737088)) and on the Jobber mobile app. The job title will not show to the client and is often used as a description of the job that you will be doing.
- **Property address**

This is the location the work is taking place.
- **Contact details**  - Primary phone number
  - Email address
- **Job details**  - Job number
  - Job type (one-off or recurring)
  - Start date
    - **Note**: The first visit for this job might not necessarily be on the start date of the job. For example, if a job is set up to start on January 1st with visits every Wednesday, unless January 1st is a Wednesday, the first visit won't be on January 1st.
  - End date
  - Billing frequency (how often this job will be invoiced for. Typically, one-off jobs will be invoiced upon job completion (this is the default for one-off jobs) whereas recurring jobs may have a repeating invoicing schedule)
  - Automatic payments (If this job is set up with automatic payments, this will say "yes")
  - Schedule

#### Line items, labor, and expenses

![A screenshot showing the profitability, line items, labour, and expenses section of a job. The profit bar, labour, and expenses sections are available on select plans. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317344989975)

This section of the job includes:

- **Profit bar**

The profit bar appears on one-off jobs on select plans as part of Jobber's [job costing](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/14343244961175) feature. To minimize the profit bar, select **Hide Profitability**.
- **Line items**

These are the products or services you are offering on this job. Line items can be selected from your [products and services list](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735848), or added as a custom line item for this job. To add a new line item to this job, select **New Line Item**.

**Note**: A job can support up to 100 line items.
- **Labor**

Time tracking is available on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/). These are the time entries for your team members who have logged time towards this job. Time entries for this job can be created using the [timers in the Jobber mobile app](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/7447924360855) or from Jobber.com by selecting **New Time Entry** from this job, or from the **Time Sheets** [tab on the side navigation](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009543028).
- **Expenses**

Expense tracking is available on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/). These are [expenses](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009615927) that have been recorded against this job. To add a new expense to this job, select **New Expense**.

#### Visits

There is a difference between a job and a visit. A job is the contract of work you are doing, whereas a visit is when you are going out to the client's property to do the work. A job may contain either one or many visits.

The visit will include the instructions entered when creating the job.

![A screenshot showing the visits section of a job. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317344993175)

Visits are created when the job is created based on the schedule. You can also add another visit to the job manually. From the visits section of the job, select the **New Visit** button.

It's possible to make an update to only one visit rather than the full job. To edit a visit, select that visit's date from the **Visits** section on the job. Any updates made here only change this one specific visit. However, if you make an update to the job (such as changing the instructions) this overwrites the visits.

YouTube

It's important to mark visits as completed as you finish them. This ensures that job status reporting is accurate, and that invoices or invoice reminders are generated at the appropriate times.

#### Billing

The billing section shows the invoicing plan for this job, including invoices that have already been created from this job as well as [invoice reminders](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009517847). Invoice reminders are what triggers jobs to be put into "requires Invoicing" status, which is the status that prompts you to invoice (including [batch invoicing).](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009687088) Invoice reminders also appear on the calendar to remind you of what you need to invoice and when.

The billing sections on one-off and recurring jobs include different information for each job type.

#### The billing section on one-off jobs

The billing section on one-off jobs has two tabs:

- **Billing** where you will see a history of the invoices you've issued this client,
- **Invoicing Reminder** with a list of upcoming [invoice reminders](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009517847).

![A screenshot showing the billing section of a one-off job. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/25486582048535)

When creating a one-off job, you will have the option to [invoice](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009685047) the job when it's complete which generates an invoice reminder upon job completion. However, it's possible to generate multiple invoice for one-off jobs before or after the job's completion. In the billing section for one-off jobs, you will see the history of invoices for this job by priority, including:

- Invoice status
- Invoice number
- Subject
- Last issued
- Due date (the most recent due dates will be listed first)
- Total
- Balance

The ordering logic for the billing section on one-off jobs is in order of priority:

1. Job status:
1. past due
2. awaiting payment
3. draft
4. paid
5. bad debt
2. Invoice due date by most recent
3. Invoice number (ascending)

#### The billing section on recurring jobs

When creating recurring jobs, you will set up _how_ you want to invoice (per visit or fixed price), as well as _when_ you'd like to invoice. The invoicing schedule you set up here is what generates invoice reminders that will prompt you to invoice for this job.

For recurring jobs, invoices and invoice reminders appear in the billing section together. The billing heading will show when the next invoice reminder is for this job. When that date arrives, the job will move into requires invoicing status.

**Note**: If there is an overdue invoice reminder for this job, the job will already be in "requires invoicing" status.

If you are using [automatic payments](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036931633) (available on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/)), the invoicing schedule created here controls when your clients will be invoiced automatically and charged.

![A screenshot of the billing section of a job. It shows one job as past due, another as awaiting payment, and a third as being in draft status. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/25486582055703)

#### Chemical tracking

[Chemical tracking](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009615967) (available on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/)) allows you to track chemical and pesticide usage. This is useful in jurisdictions that require chemical/pesticide use recorded for up to seven years. This section of the job shows chemical treatments that have been logged against this job. Select **Record Treatment** to add chemicals used on this job.

**Note**: There is no chemical tracking in the mobile app. Chemicals must be recorded from Jobber.com.

![A screenshot showing the chemical tracking section of a job. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317345029783)

#### Internal notes and attachments

This section of the job is where you can add notes and upload files. These notes are internal by default, however attachments can be attached to emails. Learn more about [Notes and Attachments](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000110368).

![A screenshot showing the internal notes field of a job. ](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/34793109235863)

### Create a new job

There are many places in Jobber where a new job can be created, including:

- the **Create** button from the side navigation
- the **More Actions** button on schedule
- the **More Actions** button on a client’s profile
- the **New Job** button on [Home](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051851213) ( [Dashboard](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033835353) for non-admin users)

### Actions on jobs

From the **More Actions** button on a job, there are multiple actions you can take:

- **Close job:** To close (or cancel) a job, click **More Actions > Close Job**. If the job needs to be invoiced, then it will go to the **Requires Invoicing** status, once it has been invoiced it will then show as **Archived**. If the job does not need to be invoiced then it will go to **Archived** status right after being closed. If the job has incomplete visits in the past or scheduled today (including later today) Jobber will prompt you to complete them in case these visits were done but not marked complete. If there are incomplete visits in the future (beyond today), Jobber won't prompt you to complete these visits and instead ask if you'd like to remove them.



**Note:** If you have automatic payments turned on, completing visits will charge the client if you are invoicing per visit.

![A screenshot showing the pop-up that appears when a job with incomplete visits is closed. The example shows the options to either complete one past visit and remove 18 future visits, or to remove all 19 incomplete visits.](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317365980951)

- **Reopen Job:** If a job is closed and archived but needs to be reopened and scheduled again, click **Reopen Job** beside the **More Actions** button in the top right of the job.
- **Create Similar Job:** This option creates a new job based on how the current job is set up, with an option to choose a new (or the same) client. There are the items that are copied:   - job title
  - if the job is one-off or recurring
  - scheduling information minus times
  - team assignments
  - billing information
  - line items
  - attached job forms



    **Note:** The job instructions are not copied.
- **Send job follow-up email:** Send your client a [job follow-up email](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009739988) (available on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/)) to have your clients complete a survey and follow-up on the work completed.
- **Email booking confirmation**: Send your client a [booking confirmation](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060143753) (available on [select plans](https://getjobber.com/pricing/)) to let them know their work has been booked.
- **Generate invoice:** To make an invoice for the job click the **Generate Invoice** button located in the top right of the job.

**Note:** You can generate more than one invoice on a job. Creating an invoice does not close the job.
- **Download PDF:** This will open the PDF in a separate tab in your browser. You can customize the job PDF in your [PDF style](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009566987) settings
- **Collect signature:** This will bring up the signature pad that your client can sign. Check the box Send your client a copy to email the job PDF with their signature attached.

**Note:** The signed PDF will be saved in the 'Internal Notes' section at the bottom of the job.

![A screenshot showing the signature pad.](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22317345060503)

- **Email job costs CSV**: For accounts that are using [job costing](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/14343244961175), a team member with the job costing permission enabled can export the job costs CSVs. This is a zip file that is sent via email containing CSV files for line items, expenses, and time sheet entries.

**Note**: iOS and Windows will allow users to open the file and CSVs, however on some devices you may need to download the zip file before opening it.

### Jobs list

Click **Jobs** from the side navigation to view the [jobs list](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036772713). The page gives you a list of your jobs, including an overview to monitor statuses, as well as buttons for actions you can take from this page. This page can be used to monitor the statuses of your jobs to make sure that nothing is slipping through the cracks.

![A screenshot of Jobber's account side bar with an arrow pointing to Jobs](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/23063108805527)

#### Job statuses

On the right of the job page, there is a job overview. This overview shows statuses as icons to give you a quick look at the number of jobs you have in these statuses that might require your attention.

Statuses for jobs include:

- **Active:** Active jobs are the jobs in progress.
- **Upcoming:** These are jobs with future visits scheduled.
- **Today:** Jobs with visits scheduled today.
- **Late:** These jobs are active. They have visits where the scheduled visit date has passed, but the visit wasn't completed.
- **Unscheduled:** These are jobs that have visits created, but the visits have been set up to be scheduled later.
- **Action Required:** These are jobs that are still active, but they have no more upcoming visits or invoice reminders. You can think of action required like being "on hold". Action required is a prompt to either schedule more visits or close the job.
- **Requires Invoicing:** Jobs that are in requires invoicing status have an overdue [invoice reminder](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009517847). This is a prompt to create an invoice for this job.
- **Ending Within 30 Days:** These are jobs that have an end date that falls within the next 30 days. After their end date, this job won't appear on the calendar anymore.

**Note:** This status refers to _jobs_ (not visits) where the job duration is ending in the next 30 days. The end date of a job isn’t the date of the last visit, it’s the start date + the duration.
- **Archived:** These are closed jobs that no longer need to be invoiced. These are the jobs that you are done with.
