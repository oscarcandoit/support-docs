### Overview

You might find that after creating a job, changes will need to be made. Don't worry, you can still edit a job as much as needed once it's created.

To edit a job, go to **Jobs** from the side navigation, search for the job that you need to make changes on, and click it so that it opens the job. Then click **Edit** to edit the job.

The **Edit** button will be located in the top right of the job, beside **More Actions**.

![Edit jobs.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22358018726039)

### Job title and instructions

On the edit screen of the **Job**, you can change the job title and instructions.

The title of the job appears on the schedule by default, however the way visits appear on the schedule can be updated in **Settings > Work Settings**. Job title does not appear to the client and often serves as a short description of the job.

The instructions field is where you can add directions for your team for this job. This is also an internal field and the instructions will appear on each visit. Instructions on a particular visit can be edited from the visit on the calendar which will change the instructions for that visit only.

### Job details

To change the job number, click **Change** beside the job number. You can then change it to something different. The numbers for job will count upwards by one from the highest number in the system.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 4.29.35 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22358026257559)

If you have [custom fields](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009735928) set up on the job level, you can fill them out while editing the job.

### Job schedule

You can edit the schedule for both one-off jobs and for recurring jobs.

For [one-off jobs](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009379047), you can edit the start and end date, the start and end times, [arrival windows](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/13004689565463), and team. The calendar is shown by default to see what times are available, however it can be hidden by selecting **Hide Calendar**.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.42.11 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357977779607)

For [recurring jobs](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009542848), you can edit the start and end date, the start and end times, how often the schedule repeats, [arrival windows](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/13004689565463), and team.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.15.33 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22358026263831)

To change the team members assigned to this job, click the **x** beside each person's name to remove them from the job. To add a new team member, select **Assign** then check them off from the team list.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.16.33 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357977788567)

If you edit the schedule (including start and end times) or team assignment, any incomplete visits on the job will regenerate to follow the set schedule and crew assignment. Any visits marked complete will not be changed. You will need to select **I understand** in order to save your changes.

![Screenshot 2024-03-20 at 10.09.05 AM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22358026271383)

### Invoicing

On a one-off job, to change whether Jobber will ask you to invoice for the job once it is closed, check or uncheck the "Remind me to Invoice when I close the job" box.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.42.59 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357977798679)

On a recurring job, you can change whether a job is being billed per visit or fixed price. You can also change when you want to invoice.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.17.10 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22358026283671)

### Line items

An edit made to the quantity, name, description or price of a line item at the _job level_ overrides these values on completed visits in both Jobber.com as well as the Jobber Mobile App. Edits made to these fields on the _visits level_ update only the visit.

#### Custom visit line items

Since visits are automatically created with the same line items as on the job, there may be times when you want to charge for something different on one or more of the visits for the job. Maybe it's a one-time service you're performing or maybe you needed some additional products. To do this you would use **custom visit line items**. This allows you to add a different line item to a specific visit for a job.

To add a custom line item to a visit, navigate to the visit. This can be done _once the job is created_ from:

- **the schedule**: From the side navigation menu, click **Schedule.** From your favorite view of the schedule, click the visit. From the visit details pop-up, click **Edit**.
- **the job:** Navigate to the job and scroll down to the **Visits** section. Click the visit date you'd like to customize. From the pop-up click **More Actions > Edit.**

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.20.57 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357977816855)

From the edit screen of the visit, there is a section showing the line items and their quantities. To update the quantity, you can type the new number in the **QTY** field. To remove a line item, click the red **trash can icon.** If on this visit, you'll be adding an extra service or charging for an additional product, click **+** to add the line item to this visit only.

![Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 3.24.31 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22358026292119)

After you save, since the visit is now different than the job (which you can think of like the overall work contract), on the job you will see a list of the visits that vary from what appears on the job located under the line item name.  To see the details of the changed quantities, navigate to the visits section and open the visit for the listed date(s).

**Note**: if you edit the line item quantity of a visit on the job view page you will need to refresh the page to see this updated on the line items on the job page

![Screenshot_2024-03-26_at_3_26_09 PM.png](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/article_attachments/22357977823895)

When an invoice is made, the custom visit line items will only transfer for the visit dates they have been put on.

**Note:** If a custom visit line item is used on a **fixed-rate billing job**, then it will not transfer to the invoice. This is because fixed-rate billing jobs are not invoiced based on the visits.

### Delete job

To delete a job, select **Edit**. Then from the edit screen, select **Delete** in the bottom left corner.

**Note**: Once a job has been deleted, it cannot be recovered.
