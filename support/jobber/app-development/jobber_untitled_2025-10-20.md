# Atlantis Design System

[Atlantis](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/) is Jobber’s open-source design
system. The primary objective for Atlantis is to provide a system of reusable
components to help developers build beautiful and consistent interfaces quickly.
Having a collection of components that are ready to be reused as well as
clearly-defined design standards means developers can build scalable projects
and apps. Apollo Client is required to use Atlantis.

While building your app, you might find it helpful to reference Atlantis for
[product vocabulary](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--docs)
so that you use the correct terminology to refer to items in Jobber. There is
also a
[voice and tone guide](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/?path=/docs/content-voice-tone--docs)
with guidelines on punctuation in microcopy, word choice, and phrasing so that
actions are described in an active voice.

Atlantis also contains a library of
[components](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/?path=/docs/components-selections-checkbox--docs)
that can be used for your app. Each component includes a use case, an example
(including a code snippet), as well as design usage guidelines. In many of the
examples in Atlantis, there is a User Interface (UI) component paired with a
code snippet. You are able to click and interact with the UI as well as modify
the code snippet and see how the UI changes.

The Checkbox component is a straightforward example for trying Atlantis as well
as one that many apps will need for configuration pages.
