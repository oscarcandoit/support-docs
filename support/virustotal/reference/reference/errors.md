The VirusTotal API follows the conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure. Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error in the request (e.g. a missing parameter, a resource was not found). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error in VirusTotal&#x27;s servers and should be rare.

Unsuccessful requests return additional information about the error in JSON format.
