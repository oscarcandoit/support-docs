# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs.
This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.

## Why use examples?

- **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
- **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
- **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:

- **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
- **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
- **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.
