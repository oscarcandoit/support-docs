formatdate-time

CreatedAtTime

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

formatdate-time

EndedAtTime

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended. Specified only once processing ends.

Processing ends when every request in a Message Batch has either succeeded, errored, canceled, or expired.

formatdate-time

ExpiresAtTime

Accepts one of the following:

const MessageBatchProcessingStatusInProgressMessageBatchProcessingStatus = "in\_progress"

const MessageBatchProcessingStatusCancelingMessageBatchProcessingStatus = "canceling"

const MessageBatchProcessingStatusEndedMessageBatchProcessingStatus = "ended"

RequestCounts[MessageBatchRequestCounts](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages#message_batch_request_counts)

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

Canceledint64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have been canceled.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Erroredint64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that encountered an error.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Expiredint64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have expired.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Processingint64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.

Succeededint64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

ResultsURLstring

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

TypeMessageBatch

Object type.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

Accepts one of the following:

const MessageBatchMessageBatchMessageBatch = "message\_batch"
