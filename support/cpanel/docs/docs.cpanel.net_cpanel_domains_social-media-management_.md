Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

Note:

WebPros International, LLC currently provides this feature in a limited release, with plans to expand its availability in future updates.

## Overview

The _Social Media Management (Powered by SocialBee)_ interface helps you create and manage social media campaigns for the domains hosted on your cPanel account. Through this interface, you can easily manage your posts and ensure consistent engagement on multiple social media networks, including Facebook®, LinkedIn®, and X™ (formerly Twitter™). You can also schedule and reuse content across these networks.

Important:

- This interface uses the [SocialBee](https://socialbee.com/) platform to generate a social media strategy for your websites. To make full use of this interface, you must either [sign up](https://help.socialbee.com/article/55-how-do-i-sign-up) for a SocialBee account or [log in](https://app.socialbee.com/) to an existing SocialBee account.
- When you log in to the SocialBee website for the first time, you will automatically get a free 14-day trial. After 14 days, you **must** purchase a [SocialBee license](https://store.cpanel.net/store/socialbee) to continue using the SocialBee website.
- To use the Social Media Management feature, your domain **must** meet the following requirements:

  - Have a valid IP address in DNS.
  - Have a website already set up.

## Social Media Management landing page

The first time you access the _Social Media Management_ interface, a landing page will appear. The landing page displays the following sections:

- The [_Create a social media campaign for your profile in just 5 minutes._](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/social-media-management/#create-a-social-media-campaign-for-your-profile-in-just-5-minutes) section.
- The [_Already have an account with SocialBee?_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/social-media-management/#already-have-an-account-with-socialbee) card.
- The _Not in charge of Social Media?_ card. If you are not in charge of social media for your domain, copy the [socialbee.com](https://socialbee.com/) link and share it with your marketing team.

### Create a social media campaign for your profile in just 5 minutes

To create a social media campaign for your domain, perform the following steps:

1. In the _Search for your website_ text box, select or enter the domain for which you want to create a social media campaign.
2. Click _Let’s get started_. A new interface will appear.
3. Follow the instructions in the [_Set up Social Media Management_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/social-media-management/#set-up-social-media-management) section to create your social media campaign.

### Already have an account with SocialBee

If you already have an account on the SocialBee platform, you can access it by clicking _Click here to log in_. The SocialBee login screen will appear in a new browser window. Follow the instructions in the window to [log in to your SocialBee account](https://help.socialbee.com/hc/en-us/articles/29979234923031-How-Do-I-Login-Into-My-SocialBee-Account).

## Set up Social Media Management

Perform the following steps to set up the Social Media Management feature.

### Business info

The Social Media Management feature automatically gathers information about your company or organization from your website. You **must** accept or update this information.

To accept or update this information, enter or select the following values in the _Business info_ interface:

- The name of your company or organization.
- The motto or tagline of your company or organization.
- The services that your company or organization provides.
- Your brand’s tone of voice.






Note:





You can only select **one** tone of voice.

- Your target audience.
- The language for your social media posts.

Important:

You **must** click _Continue_ after you have entered, updated, or selected each value.

Then, click _Create social media strategy_. The _Suggested social networks_ interface will appear.

Or, click _Clear inputs_ to start over and re-enter your information.

### Suggested social networks

The _Suggested social networks_ interface displays your company’s or organization’s existing social media profiles, the percentage of your followers that access them, and their suggested posting frequencies. If your website does not include any social media profiles, the interface displays recommended social media networks and their suggested posting frequencies.

Click _Generate posts_. The _Generated posts_ interface will appear.

### Generated posts

The Social Media Management feature generates sample social media posts with text and images for the suggested social networks based on your company or organization data. You can delete or regenerate these posts in the _Generated posts_ interface, and you can [edit them](https://help.socialbee.com/article/74-how-do-i-add-a-post#post-editor) later on the SocialBee website.

- To delete a post, click the trash can icon (![trash can icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/socialbee-trashcan.png)) for the post.
- To regenerate a post, click the reload icon (![reload icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/socialbee-reload.png)) for the post.

Important:

If the interface displays fewer than seven posts, the _A strong posting plan requires more than 6 posts._ banner will appear. You **must** click _Generate more posts_ to generate additional posts.

Click _View posting plan_ to accept the posts. The _Posting plan_ interface will appear.

### Posting plan

The _Posting plan_ interface displays a calendar with a suggested posting plan for when to make your social media posts during the next week. The posting plan includes dates, times, and suggested content.

Note:

You can make changes to the posting plan afterward on the SocialBee website.

After you have reviewed the posting plan, click _Continue_. A new interface will appear.

### Connect profiles

Before you can use the _Social Media Management_ interface to create social media posts, you **must** connect your social media profile(s). To connect your profile(s), perform the following steps:

1. Click _Open SocialBee_. The SocialBee login page will appear in your web browser.
2. [Create](https://help.socialbee.com/article/55-how-do-i-sign-up) a SocialBee account.
3. Once you have created a SocialBee account, [connect the profile](https://help.socialbee.com/article/109-what-social-accounts-can-i-add#connect) to your SocialBee account.

Note:

After you create a SocialBee account, you will receive weekly analytics reports via email for your connected social media profile(s). To stop receiving these reports, disable the _Email me a weekly Analytics report._ setting on the [_Notification Settings_](https://app.socialbee.com/settings/notifications) page in SocialBee.

## Use Social Media Management

Once you have completed the setup process, refresh the _Social Media Management_ interface.
