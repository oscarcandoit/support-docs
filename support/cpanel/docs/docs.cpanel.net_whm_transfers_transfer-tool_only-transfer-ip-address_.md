Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

To change **only** the IP address a server uses, use WHM’s [_IP Migration Wizard_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/ip-functions/ip-migration-wizard) interface ( _WHM » Home » IP Functions » IP Migration Wizard_).

## Update license IP address

If the IP address is the server’s main IP address, you **must** also update the IP address that your cPanel license uses. You can update your license’s IP address through [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) or through the [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/).

Important:

You can **only** transfer a cPanel license to an IP address that does **not** already possess a cPanel license.

### Transfer license IP address via cPanel Store

If you purchased your license directly from WebPros International, LLC, perform the following steps to update the IP address it uses:

1. Log in to your [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/) account.
2. Click _My Account_. The _My Account_ interface will appear.
3. Under _Orders/Licenses_, click View my licenses. The _Manage Licenses_ interface will appear.
4. Select the checkbox for the license that you wish to transfer.
5. Click _Edit IP_. The _Change IP Address_ dialog box will appear.
6. Enter the license’s new IP address in the _New IP Address_ text box.
7. Click _Save Changes_.

If you experience any issues with the transfer, [open a support ticket](https://tickets.cpanel.net/).

### Transfer license IP address via Manage2

If you purchased your license via [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/), perform the steps in our [Transfer a License](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/transfer-a-license) documentation to update the IP address it uses.
