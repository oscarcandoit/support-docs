## How to Create a Demo cPanel Account

Last modified: _2024 October 3_

* * *

## Overview

This document explains how to create and delete a demo account. Demo accounts allow users, such as potential customers, to navigate the features of cPanel & WHM. The users will **not** be able to make changes to any files or settings.

## Select or create an account to use as a demo account

You can enable demo mode on an existing account. You **cannot** use reseller accounts as demo accounts.

You can also create a new account to use as a demo account. To create a new account, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to WHM’s [_Create a New Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/create-a-new-account/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Create a New Account_).
2. Enter a domain name in the _Domain_ text box.
3. The _Username_ text box will auto-populate, or you can create a custom username.
4. Create a custom password, or use the _Password Generator_ feature.
5. Enter a contact email address in the _Email_ text box.
6. Click _Create_ to use default settings, or choose any desired settings. A success message will appear.

After you have decided which account to use, you can [enable Demo Mode](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/manage-demo-mode/) on the account. When you enable Demo Mode, you can use the account as a demo account.

## How to delete a demo account

To delete a demo account, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to WHM’s [_Terminate Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/terminate-accounts/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Terminate Accounts_).
2. Select the demo account that you wish to delete.
3. Click _Remove_.
