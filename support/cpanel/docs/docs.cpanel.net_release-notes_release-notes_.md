## WP Toolkit 6.9.0

_2025 November 12_

##### Added WP Toolkit plugin to WordPress interface

We added a WP Toolkit plugin to the WordPress® administrative interface. Site admins can now access WP Toolkit vulnerability information directly from the WordPress admin dashboard. The plugin detects when WordPress directly installs or updates plugins and themes and immediately applies mitigation strategies.

To enable the interface on existing plugin installations, add the following lines to the `/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/wp-toolkit/var/etc/config.ini` file:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>``` | ```perl<br>integrationPluginApi = true<br>integrationPluginUiModuleEnabled = true<br>integrationPluginEventModuleEnabled = true<br>``` |

To allow site administrators to install the plugin, add the following additional line to the `/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/wp-toolkit/var/etc/config.ini` file:

```perl
integrationPluginPromo = true
```

To automatically install the plugin on all new WordPress installations, add the following additional line to the `/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/wp-toolkit/var/etc/config.ini` file:

```perl
installIntegrationPluginToNewSites = true
```

Important:

Set this option to `false` if you want to disable automatic plugin installations. Otherwise, WP Toolkit will set this option to `true` by default in future WP Toolkit updates.

##### Restore backups on different platforms

You can easily restore backups made in WP Toolkit version 6.9 on different servers and platforms, for example, a backup from Plesk restored on cPanel or a backup from cPanel restored on Plesk.

To restore a backup from another domain or server, perform the following steps:

1. Create a new WordPress site on the target domain.
2. Upload the backup.
3. Make sure the _Hide backups from other domains_ option is off.
4. Find your backup in the list and restore it. The restoration process will automatically update the relevant paths and URLs.

##### Improved vulnerability protection rules

In most cases, WP Toolkit now immediately applies vulnerability protection rules and other mitigation policies without waiting for the hourly maintenance task. WP Toolkit also now applies vulnerability protection rules to ignored low-risk vulnerabilities.

##### Other changes

- WP Toolkit now supports cloning and copying data between WordPress installations that use the Redis Object Cache plugin.
- We made accessibility and security improvements and bug fixes.
- We shortened the Feature Showcase text for the WP Guardian addon.
- We will deprecate the `-password` CLI option in the next major version of WP Toolkit (version 6.10). Use the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environmental variable instead.

## cPanel & WHM version 132

_2025 September 30_

##### Upgrade Blockers

###### MySQL 5.5 and 5.6

If your server runs a cPanel-provided MySQL version 5.5 or 5.6, you **must** upgrade to a [supported database software version](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/database-services/upgrade-database-version/#available-versions) to install or upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 132.

###### AlmaLinux OS 9, Rocky Linux™ 9, and CloudLinux OS 9

To install or upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 132, systems running RHEL 9-derived distributions must be on version 9.5 or later.

##### Upgraded temporary domains for cPanel accounts

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we expanded the functionality of temporary domains for cPanel users. You can now create temporary domains for parked and addon domains, and convert your own temporary domain to a registered domain in cPanel’s [Domains](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/domains) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Domains_).

However, you **cannot** convert your account’s main domain from a temporary domain to a registered domain. To make changes to your primary domain, contact your hosting provider.

##### Updated Dovecot to version 2.4

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we updated Dovecot to version 2.4. This major upgrade includes changes to configuration parameters, and if you use a `.local` file for your configuration you **must** [update your templates](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/mailserver-configuration/#add-dovecot-settings) for the changes.

This update also includes changes to password hashing and **blocks** the use of weak password hashing. This means that accounts that use a hashing method such as MD5 will **not** be able to log in to IMAP or POP3 to retrieve email.

To get around this issue, set your [PAM configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) to use a stronger hashing scheme.

You can also set the _Allow Weak Authentication Schemes_ setting in WHM’s [Mailserver Configuration](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/mailserver-configuration) interface to _Yes_. Both of these options will allow users to log in and change their password. We **strongly** recommend that you update your PAM configuration and force a password change if you are using a less secure hashing method. For more information, read about [Dovecot’s password schemes](https://doc.dovecot.org/2.4.0/core/config/auth/schemes.html).

For more information about changes to Dovecot in version 2.4, read the [Dovecot](https://doc.dovecot.org/) documentation.

##### Added Sieve filtering to Dovecot and Roundcube

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added support for [Sieve filtering](http://sieve.info/overview) to Dovecot and Roundcube. You can now use Sieve to filter incoming email messages directly in Roundcube.

##### Added support for AlmaLinux 10

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added support for the AlmaLinux OS 10 operating system. For more information about this operating system, read our [System Requirements for AlmaLinux OS](https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/system-requirements-almalinux/) and our [Third Party Software End of Life Policy](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/third-party/third-party-software-end-of-life-policy/) documentation.

##### Added support for Ubuntu 24

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added support for the Ubuntu® 24 LTS operating system. For more information about this operating system, read our [System Requirements for Ubuntu](https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/system-requirements-ubuntu/) and our [Third Party Software End of Life Policy](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/third-party/third-party-software-end-of-life-policy/#operating-systems) documentation.

##### Upgraded Perl

cPanel & WHM now uses Perl version 5.42. For more information, read our [Guide to Perl in cPanel - Perl Environments](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/guides/guide-to-perl/guide-to-perl-in-cpanel-perl-environments/) documentation.

##### Added WebPros Account for WHM logins

Note:

WebPros International, LLC currently provides this feature in a limited release, with plans to expand its availability in future updates.

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added the ability to use [WebPros Account](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/webpros-account/) as an external authentication method in WHM’s [_Manage External Authentications_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/security-center/manage-external-authentications/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Security Center » Manage External Authentications_). This allows server administrators to log in to WHM with their WebPros Account credentials.

##### Added the ability to edit default DMARC records

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added the ability to customize the default DMARC record using WHM API 1’s [`set_default_dmarc_record`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/EmailAuth::set_default_dmarc_record/) function. This allows for stricter email authentication policies and supports advanced DMARC options.

##### Enabled Interface Analytics automatically

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we **fully** remove personal, private, and security information from every step of analytics gathering. This change lets us automatically enable Interface Analytics, though we allow WHM administrators to make it optional. For more information, read our [How to Allow Users to Manage Interface Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-allow-users-to-manage-interface-analytics/) documentation.

##### Added in-product survey

Note:

WebPros International, LLC currently provides this feature in a limited release, with plans to expand its availability in future updates.

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added an in-product cPanel & WHM survey to gather data about how our customers use our product. Server administrators will see a pop-up survey window the first time they access WHM after the upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 132. cPanel and Webmail users will see the survey window the first time they access cPanel or Webmail after the upgrade.

##### Added custom search keyword support to WHM plugins

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added support for custom WHM plugin search keywords. This change allows WHM administrators to customize search results so that users can find plugins more easily. For more information about how to manage custom search keywords, read our [How to Manage WHM Plugin Search Keywords](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-manage-whm-plugin-search-keywords/) documentation.

##### Tightened permissions on the /etc/trueusersowners file

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we tightened the permissions on the `/etc/trueuserowners` file. This change prevents this file from being world-readable. This may cause errors, such as displaying incorrect contact information on the default CGI pages. To avoid these issues, we strongly recommend that you install the `mod_suexec` Apache module to handle your code.

For more information about this change, read our [Best Practices for Code and Script Permissions](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/best-practices-for-code-and-script-permissions/) documentation.

##### Added new notification settings

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added a new notification for API token creation. We also added the `root` user to the change password notifications. You can adjust these notification settings in WHM’s [_Contact Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/server-contacts/contact-manager) interface ( _WHM » Home » Server Contacts » Contact Manager_).

##### Added new Mailserver Configuration setting

In cPanel & WHM version 132, we added the _Allow Weak Authentication Schemes_ setting in WHM’s [Mailserver Configuration](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/mailserver-configuration) interface ( _WHM » Home » Service Configuration » Mailserver Configuration_).

This setting allows the use of weak authentication hashing methods. This can be useful to allow users who use older password hashes to log in so they can change their passwords. We **strongly** recommend that you set your [PAM configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) to use a stronger hashing scheme.

##### New UAPI functions

- [`Leika::leika_get_config`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/leika_get_config/) — This function retrieves a cPanel account’s Leika configuration. Leika is an internal module that cPanel & WHM uses to track feature access. The configuration allows users to identify if they can [manage Interface Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-allow-users-to-manage-interface-analytics/) for their account.
- [`InProductSurvey::get_in_product_survey_url`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/get_in_product_survey_url/) — This function returns whether to display the cPanel & WHM product survey banner and link for a cPanel user.
- [`UserData::get_scoped_userdata`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/get_scoped_userdata/) — This function retrieves the userdata for a given scope and cPanel user.
- [`UserData::set_scoped_userdata`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/set_scoped_userdata/) — This function sets the userdata for a given scope and cPanel user.

##### New WHM API 1 functions

- [`leika_get_config`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/leika_get_config/) — This function retrieves a WHM account’s Leika configuration. Leika is an internal module that cPanel & WHM uses to track feature access. The configuration allows users to identify if they can [manage Interface Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-allow-users-to-manage-interface-analytics/) for their account.
- [`get_default_dmarc_record`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/EmailAuth::get_default_dmarc_record/) – This function retrieves the server’s default DMARC record.
- [`set_default_dmarc_record`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/EmailAuth::set_default_dmarc_record/) – This function sets the server’s default DMARC record.
- [`get_in_product_survey_url`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/get_in_product_survey_url/) — This function returns whether to display the cPanel & WHM product survey banner and link in WHM.
- [`get_scoped_userdata`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/get_scoped_userdata/) — This function retrieves the userdata for a given scope.
- [`set_scoped_userdata`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/set_scoped_userdata/) — This function sets the userdata for a given scope.

## cPanel & WHM version 130

_2025 July 2_

##### Added temporary domains for cPanel accounts

In cPanel & WHM version 130, we added the ability to create a cPanel account with a temporary domain. This feature allows users to design and collaborate with others on a website without a registered domain.

You can create a cPanel account with a temporary domain in WHM’s [_Create a New Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/create-a-new-account/#domain-information) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Create a New Account_). You can update the domain to use a registered domain in WHM’s [_Modify an Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/modify-an-account/#basic-information) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Modify an Account_).

To learn more about temporary domains, read our [temporary domains](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/create-a-new-account/#temporary-domains) documentation.

This option is especially useful when performing a Live Transfer.

##### Added new option to the restorepkg Script

In cPanel & WHM version 130, we added the `--update_dns_zone` option to WHM’s [`/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/restorepkg` script](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/scripts/the-restorepkg-script/). This option allows you to disable transferring DNS zonefiles when you restore a cPanel account from a backup file.

##### Added new Tweak Setting to System

In cPanel & WHM version 130, we added the _Size, in MB, for the /tmp partition secured by securetmp_ to the _System_ section of WHM’s [_Tweak Settings_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/server-configuration/tweak-settings/#system) interface ( _WHM » Home » Server Configuration » Tweak Settings_). This setting allows you to set the amount of disk space that the user’s `/tmp` partition uses when `securetmp` is enabled.

##### Updated Apache logformat Default Settings in Global Configuration

In cPanel & WHM version 130, we updated the _LogFormat (combined)_ and _LogFormat (common)_ settings in WHM’s [_Global Configuration_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/global-configuration/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Service Configuration » Global Configuration_). This changed the default Apache [log format](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats) to use `%a` instead of `%h`.

##### Upgraded internal PHP

In cPanel & WHM version 130, we upgraded internal cPanel PHP from PHP 8.3 to PHP 8.4.

If your server uses MariaDB for its database server, MariaDB 11.4 now appears as an option in WHM’s [_Upgrade Database Version_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/database-services/upgrade-database-version/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Database Services » Upgrade Database Version_).

##### Improved DMARC support

In cPanel & WHM version 124, we improved our support for [DMARC](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#dmarc). We added the ability for server administrators to apply a default DMARC policy to the server’s domains. We also made it easier for cPanel users to manage their domains’ DMARC records.

As part of our improved support, we made the following changes:

- **Enabled the Advanced Zone Editor by default** — When your server updates to cPanel & WHM version 124, the _Feature Showcase_ interface displays the _Enable Advanced Zone Editing for Improved DMARC Support_ option. When you select this option, the system enables the _Zone Editor (AAAA, CAA, DMARC, SRV, TXT)_ feature in WHM’s [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Packages » Feature Manager_) for all feature lists with the _Zone Editor (A, CNAME, MX)_ feature enabled.



Important:





We **strongly** recommend that you enable this option. If you do **not** enable this option, your users may not be able to manage their DMARC records.





On new installations of cPanel & WHM version 124, the system automatically enables the _Zone Editor (AAAA, CAA, DMARC, SRV, TXT)_ feature for the _default_ feature list in WHM’s [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Packages » Feature Manager_).

- **Added a new interface for server-wide DMARC records** — We added WHM’s [_Email DNS Record Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/dns-functions/email-dns-record-manager/) interface ( _WHM » Home » DNS Functions » Email DNS Record Manager_). This interface allows you to apply a default DMARC policy to your server’s domains.

- **Added DMARC to Email Deliverability** — We added the ability to add a default DMARC policy to WHM’s [_Email Deliverability_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/email/email-deliverability-in-whm/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Email » Email Deliverability_) and cPanel’s [_Email Deliverability_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-deliverability-in-cpanel/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Deliverability_).

- **Added DMARC to Create a New Account and Modify an Account** — We added DMARC support to WHM’s [_Create a New Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/create-a-new-account/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Create a New Account_) and WHM’s [_Modify an Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/modify-an-account/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Modify an Account_). To add a default DMARC policy to domains on a new or modified account, select the _Enable DMARC on this account._ checkbox in the _DNS Settings_ section of the corresponding interface.


##### New UAPI functions

- [`EmailAuth::apply_dmarc`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/EmailAuth::apply_dmarc/) — This function applies a DMARC policy to a user’s domain or domains.

##### WP Guardian Vulnerability Protection for single WordPress sites

You can now purchase the WP Guardian addon with Vulnerability Protection for individual WordPress sites.

- Users can purchase this addon for any WordPress site they can access in WP Toolkit.
- The single-site WP Guardian addon does not include other Deluxe features like [Smart Updates](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/administrator-guide/website-management/wp-toolkit.73391/#smart) or Smart PHP Updates.
- Sites that use this addon do not count toward the _WordPress websites with Vulnerability Protection_ limit in the WP Toolkit package extension.
- The ability for users to buy this addon cannot be restricted via the _WordPress websites with Vulnerability Protection_ setting in the WP Toolkit package extension.
- If a server-level WP Guardian addon license is already present on the server, the system disables the ability to buy a single-site addon.
- To enable purchasing of this addon, add the following option to your server’s `/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/wp-toolkit/var/etc/config.ini` file:


```bash
[ext-wp-toolkit]
virtualPatchesLicensingForEndCustomers = true
```

- We will release this addon selectively and gradually so that server administrators have enough time to disable it, if needed.

##### Added new rank for active exploited vulnerabilities

Actively exploited vulnerabilities now have their own Critical risk rank.

##### Other changes

- Codeable integration now tracks server ownership for the upcoming affiliate program.
- WP Toolkit now greys-out addressed vulnerabilities to help users focus on non-addressed ones.
- If you try to enable Vulnerability Protection without first adding it to a package, you will see a message that tells you to enable Vulnerability Protection.

* * *

## WP Toolkit 6.4.0

_2024 June 11_

##### New Vulnerability Protection feature

We added the Vulnerability Protection feature to [WP Guardian](https://wpguardian.com/). Vulnerability Protection is a security feature for WordPress websites that provides a simple, automated way to neutralize vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins, themes, and core.

Once you enable Vulnerability Protection on a site, the feature automatically neutralizes high-risk and medium-risk vulnerabilities. By default, the feature ignores low-risk vulnerabilities.

- When you enable Vulnerability Protection, the system installs a WordPress plugin that applies special protection rules. These protection rules work like a firewall and do not touch or modify the site code. The plugin applies and removes the protection rules only for specific vulnerabilities on the given site, so the rules have minimal impact on site performance.
- The Vulnerability Protection feature and its corresponding upsell prompts are not visible to users by default. The server administrator can control access to this feature via a separate limit in the user’s package.
- The Vulnerability Protection feature is a part of the WP Guardian security suite. You **must** purchase a separate [WP Guardian addon license](https://store.cpanel.net/store/extensions) to get this feature.

##### Customize the “Hire a developer” link

We added the ability to either change the destination of the “Hire a developer” link or to hide it completely in the global WP Toolkit settings. For more information, read the _Updating the Hire a Developer Link_ section of our [WP Toolkit](https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/obsidian/administrator-guide/website-management/wp-toolkit.73391/#updating-the-hire-a-developer-link) documentation.

##### Automatically provision WordPress and sets

Server administrators can now automatically provision WordPress and its sets for cPanel accounts. To do this, select the _Autoinstall WordPress upon account creation_ checkbox, then select the set to install in the _Autoinstall Set_ menu for the WP Toolkit package extension in WHM’s [_Edit a Package_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/edit-a-package/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Packages » Edit a Package_).

## cPanel & WHM version 122

_2024 July 9_

##### Added ALIAS DNS record support

In cPanel & WHM version 122, we added experimental support for the ALIAS DNS record to WHM’s [_DNS Zone Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/dns-functions/dns-zone-manager) interface ( _WHM » Home » DNS Functions » DNS Zone Manager_) and cPanel’s [_Zone Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/zone-editor) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Zone Editor_). This record **only** works on systems that run PowerDNS.

Warning:

- We strongly recommend that you do **not** use this function. Using the ALIAS DNS record may result in unexpected behavior, including website downtime, inconsistency in the handling of the record, and security vulnerabilities.
- This record is only available if you enable access to it and use [PowerDNS](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/dns/how-to-use-cpanels-powerdns/).

For more information about ALIAS DNS records, read our [The ALIAS DNS Record](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/dns/the-alias-dns-record/) documentation.

##### Experimental ARC support in Exim

In cPanel & WHM version 122, we added experimental support for  in Exim. For more information, read our [_Exim Configuration Manager Basic Editor_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/exim-configuration-manager-basic-editor/#_experimental-enable-arc-signing-for-outgoing-mail_) documentation.

Experimental:

This feature is [experimental](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#experimental). If you enable this feature, email deliverability to some large providers **may** improve, but WebPros International, LLC does **not** guarantee it.

##### Tomcat Manager removal

In cPanel & WHM version 122, we removed WHM’s _Tomcat Manager_ interface, as it managed Tomcat 8.5, which is deprecated. Instead, use Tomcat 10.1 with [containers](https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/containers/tomcat-via-containers).

Note:

Using Tomcat with containers does **not** provide a user interface.

##### MariaDB the default database management system

When you install cPanel & WHM, it now installs MariaDB® 10.11 by default in version 122 and later. To use MySQL or a different version of MariaDB instead, you may [customize your installation](https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/customize-your-installation/) or [upgrade your database version](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/database-services/upgrade-database-version/). For more information about what database versions you can use, read our [Supported MySQL/MariaDB Versions](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/supported-mysql-mariadb-versions/) documentation.

##### Older Roundcube database versions converted to SQLite

When your server updates to cPanel & WHM version 122, if Roundcube uses **either** MySQL version 5.6 or below **or** MariaDB 10.0, the system will convert the Roundcube database to [individual SQLite databases](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/webmail/how-to-convert-roundcube-to-sqlite/). The system will also update Roundcube to [version 1.6](https://docs.cpanel.net/release-notes/110-release-notes/#roundcube-updated-to-16).

##### New UAPI functions

- [`DNS::is_alias_available`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/cpanel/operation/DNS::is_alias_available/) — This function returns whether the ALIAS DNS record is enabled.

##### New WHM API 1 functions

- [`is_alias_available`](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/openapi/whm/operation/DNS::is_alias_available/) — This function returns whether the ALIAS DNS record is enabled.

##### Removed Tomcat 8.5 functions

The following functions dealt with Tomcat 8.5, which is deprecated:

- `ea4_tomcat85_rem`
- `ea4_tomcat85_add`
- `ea4_tomcat85_list`

##### Removed scripts

- `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/check_cpanel_rpms` – We removed the `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/check_cpanel_rpms` script. Use the [`/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/check_cpanel_pkgs`](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/rpm-versions/the-check_cpanel_pkgs-script) script instead.
