## New Features

### Added Sitejet Builder plugin

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we released the Sitejet Builder plugin. With the [_Sitejet Builder_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/sitejet-builder/) interface, you can create and design a website directly in your web browser for your domain. Sitejet Builder is fully integrated with the [Sitejet Website Builder (CMS)](https://help.sitejet.io/article/536-overview-website-builder-cms) website. You can use the Sitejet Website Builder (CMS) to create a website for your domain. Then, you can publish it with your cPanel account.

Sitejet Website Builder (CMS) allows you to personalize the appearance of your website with a drag-drop editor or start from scratch and build your website from the ground up. Every template is fully customizable.

The [_Sitejet Builder_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/sitejet-builder) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Sitejet Builder_) lists all the domains associated with your account. Use this interface to view and manage the websites created for your domains with the Sitejet Website Builder (CMS). If you have an existing website, you can use this interface to build a new website for your domain with Sitejet.

Important:

In order to access the _Sitejet Builder_ interface, your system administrator **must** enable this plugin in WHM’s [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager/) interface.

For more information on Sitejet Builder plugin releases, read our [Sitejet Builder Release Notes](https://docs.cpanel.net/release-notes/sitejet-builder-release-notes/) documentation.

### Added Site Quality Monitoring plugin

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we released the Site Quality Monitoring plugin. With the [Site Quality Monitoring](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) feature, cPanel users can use the _Site Quality Monitoring_ interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_) to [monitor a cpanel-managed website and URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-settings/), [see current and past website errors](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-website-summary/), and [set email notifications](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-settings/#configure-alert-emails) to ensure that you can address problems quickly and efficiently. The feature watches your website for availability, SEO rank, broken links, and more.

For more information on Site Quality Monitoring plugin releases, read our [Site Quality Monitoring Release Notes](https://docs.cpanel.net/release-notes/site-quality-monitoring-release-notes/) documentation.

## Updated features

### Grant API token access to IPv6 addresses

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we added support for IPv6 to WHM’s [_Manage API Tokens_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/development/manage-api-tokens-in-whm/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Development » Manage API Tokens_). You can now grant access to API tokens for devices using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

### Roundcube updated to 1.6

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we updated the [Roundcube webmail client](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/webmail-clients/#roundcube) to version 1.6. If Roundcube uses **either** MySQL version 5.6 or below **or** MariaDB 10.0, the system will convert the Roundcube database to [individual SQLite databases](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/webmail/how-to-convert-roundcube-to-sqlite/).

As part of the update, you can now use the _Clear Trash on logout_ setting to purge deleted emails older than 30, 60, or 90 days when you log out of Roundcube. You can also now use the _Keep formatting_ setting to disable line-wrapping in messages you send.

##### Automatically enabled Interface Analytics

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we **fully** removed personal, private, and security information from every step of analytics gathering. We automatically install and enable the Interface Analytics plugin and disable the Interface Analytics options in the cPanel, WHM, and Webmail interfaces unless we cannot retrieve a user’s analytics configuration. For more information, read our [cPanel Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics) documentation.

To reenable Interface Analytics options, read our [How to Allow Users to Manage Interface Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-allow-users-to-manage-interface-analytics) documentation.

## Updated components

### PowerDNS updated to 4.7.2

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we updated [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) to version 4.7.2. For more information about PowerDNS, read our [How to Use cPanel’s PowerDNS](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/dns/how-to-use-cpanels-powerdns/) documentation.

### Additional functionality and expanded access for Manage Team

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we added [the audit log](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team-audit-log/), notification settings, and options for roles to cPanel’s [_Manage Team_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team) feature.

Providers with Premier Tier cPanel licenses now have access to the _Manage Team_ feature. These providers can explore the _Manage Team_ feature before it goes to full release in version 112.

Experimental:

_Manage Team_ is an experimental feature. We do **not** recommend using this feature in production environments. It is currently under development and is **only** available to a limited number of cPanel & WHM customers. It will be available for testing in future releases. For more information about the development of _Manage Team_, read our [Manage Team roadmap](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/roadmaps/manage-team-roadmap).

## Deprecated and removed items

##### Removed Account Type selection

In cPanel & WHM version 126, we removed the option to select _Account Type_ in the _Consent and Privacy_ section of cPanel’s [_Account Preferences_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/account-preferences) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Preferences » Account Preferences_).

### Removed Allow insecure contact email update Tweak Setting

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we removed the the _Allow insecure contact email update_ setting in the [_Tweak Settings_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/server-configuration/tweak-settings/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Server Configuration » Tweak Settings_).

### Removed File Manager’s HTML Editor interface

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we removed the HTML Editor feature from cPanel’s [_File Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/file-manager/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Files » File Manager_). For more information, read our [cPanel Deprecation Plan](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-deprecation-plan/#html_editor) documentation.

## Updated components

### Upgraded internal cPanel PHP to 8.1

In cPanel & WHM version 110, we upgraded internal cPanel PHP from PHP 7.4 to PHP 8.1. This affects the `cpsrvd` service and third-party applications that use internal cPanel PHP, such as [phpMyAdmin](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/databases/phpmyadmin/). For more information, read our [cPanel PHP](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/cpanel-php/110/) documentation.
