Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature allows you to reserve an IP address that is in your address pool. When you reserve an IP address, you cannot assign it to newly-created accounts. This is useful if, for example, you do not want the system to automatically assign a specific IP address to a new account as a dedicated IP address.

Important:

Reserving an IP address also prevents Apache® from listening on that IP address.

## Reserve an IP address

To reserve an IP address, perform the following steps:

1. Select the checkbox next to the IP address that you wish to reserve.






Note:




We **strongly** suggest that you specify a reason for why you reserved the IP address. This can be useful if, for example, multiple people administer your server.


2. Click _Save_.


## Unreserve an IP address

To unreserve an IP address, perform the following steps:

1. Deselect the checkbox next to the IP address that you wish to place back in the address pool.
2. Click _Save_.
