## How to Purchase CloudLinux™

Last modified: _2025 January 15_

* * *

## Overview

CloudLinux™ offers a secure version of Linux that provides advanced functionality for shared hosting environments. cPanel & WHM servers allow you to buy a license and install CloudLinux from WHM’s [_Home_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/the-whm-interface/the-whm-interface) interface.

Note:

Hosting providers can disable the alert for their licensed servers from Manage2’s [_Update Company Information_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/company/update-company-information/) interface ( _Manage2 » Company » Update Company Information_).

## Purchase from WHM

On the server for which you wish to buy an CloudLinux license, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to WHM as the `root` user or as a reseller account with `root`-level privileges.

2. Navigate to WHM’s [_Home_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/the-whm-interface/the-whm-interface) interface.







Note:





You can also access the installation option in the following interfaces:



- WHM’s [_MultiPHP Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/software/multiphp-manager-for-whm/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Software » MultiPHP Manager_).
- WHM’s [_EasyApache 4_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/software/easyapache-4-interface/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Software » EasyApache 4_). You can find the upgrade option in the PHP Versions section of the interface.

3. At the top of the _Home_ interface, click _Upgrade to CloudLinux_.







Important:





If the CloudLinux banner does not appear, one of the following conditions exists on your server:



- Your server does not support CloudLinux.

- Your hosting provider has disabled CloudLinux purchases.

- Your server could not connect to the [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/).


#### Log in to the cPanel Store.

If you have already logged in to your [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/) account, the system will request access to this account. Verify that the interface displays the correct cPanel Store username and server name. Then, click _Allow Access_. A new interface will appear.

Note:

To log in as a different cPanel Store account, click _Sign In as a Different User_. Then, perform the necessary steps to log in to the desired cPanel Store account.

#### Verify and complete your purchase.

When you buy CloudLinux through the WHM interface, the system automatically selects the appropriate license type for your server. It also detects the IPv4 address to license. Verify your license order and accept the legal agreements. Enter or select the desired payment information, and then click _Pay Now_.

- After the cPanel Store processes your order, a confirmation message will appear. You will also receive an invoice email from the cPanel Store.

- If the cPanel Store experiences problems with your order, an error message will appear. You may receive emails from cPanel Customer Service to help you resolve the issue.


#### Installation

After you complete your purchase, your browser will return to WHM and start the CloudLinux installation. After the installation is complete, you will receive a _Success_ message.

## Purchase from Manage2

Important:

To buy an CloudLinux license through Manage2, you **must** be a cPanel Partner.

#### Log in to Manage2 and enter the required license information.

Log in to your [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) account. Perform the following steps to add the CloudLinux package:

1. Navigate to Manage2’s [_Add License_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/add-license/) interface ( _Dashboard » Licenses » Add License_).

2. Use the available text boxes and menus to specify the server’s _IP address_, _Group_, and _Package_. Then, click _Add License_. A confirmation message will appear.


#### Installation

CloudLinux is now ready to install. For instructions on how to install CloudLinux, visit the CloudLinux documentation.

## Purchase from the cPanel Store

Log in to your [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/) account, and then navigate to the [_Extensions_](https://store.cpanel.net/store/extensions) interface ( _Store » Extensions_).

#### Add CloudLinux to your cPanel Store cart.

You **must** add CloudLinux to your cart with a valid IP address. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In the _Extensions_ interface ( _Store » Extensions_), click _Order Now_ on the _CloudLinux for cPanel_ or _CloudLinux_ card. The _Configure_ interface ( _Cart » Configure_) will appear.






Note:





Choose _CloudLinux for cPanel_ if you want to run cPanel & WHM on your CloudLinux server. Choose _CloudLinux_ if you do not.

2. Enter your valid IP address in the _IP Address_ text box.
3. Click _Continue_. The _Review & Checkout_ interface ( _Cart » Review & Checkout_) will appear.
4. Review your order and click _Checkout_. The _Checkout_ interface ( _Cart » Checkout_) will appear.

#### Complete your purchase.

Important:

To buy a monthly license, you **must** store a credit card on file **and** set a primary credit card. If you have not set a primary credit card, you can enter the credit card you want to use and select _Store Credit Card on File_ and _Set as Primary Credit Card_ from the cart. WebPros International, LLC will charge this card every month.

To complete your purchase, perform the following steps:

1. Accept the terms and conditions of the _EULA_.
2. Select one of the following payment options:
   - _Stored credit cards_ — Pay with a previously used card.
   - _Add a New Credit Card_ — Pay with a new card.
   - _PayPal_ — Pay with a PayPal® account.
3. Click _Complete Order_. The purchase will complete, and an invoice will appear.

#### Installation

CloudLinux is now ready to install. For instructions on how to install CloudLinux, visit the [CloudLinux](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux_installation/) documentation. After you install CloudLinux, navigate to WHM’s [_MultiPHP Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/software/multiphp-manager-for-whm/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Software » MultiPHP Manager_) again and the _CloudLinux upgrade_ banner will not appear.
