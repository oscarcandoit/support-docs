## CVE-2019-10149 Exim

Last modified: _2022 July 19_

* * *

## Background Information

On Tuesday, June 4, 2019, Exim maintainers announced that they received a report of a potential remote exploit in Exim from version 4.87 to version 4.91.

On Wednesday, June 5, 2019, the Exim maintainers released a patch for these vulnerabilities .

## Impact

According to Exim development: “We received a report of a possible remote exploit. Currently there is no evidence of an active use of this exploit. The severity depends on your configuration. It depends on how close to the standard configuration your Exim runtime configuration is. Exim 4.92 is not vulnerable.”

## Releases

The following versions of cPanel & WHM were patched to have the correct version of Exim. All previous versions of cPanel & WHM below the stated versions are potentially vulnerable to a root RCE.

- 70 — 70.0.69
- 76 — 76.0.22
- 78 — 78.0.27
- 80 — Already on Exim version 4.92 which is not vulnerable
- EDGE — Currently on version 80 which is not vulnerable
- CURRENT — Currently on version 80 which is not vulnerable
- RELEASE — Currently on version 80 which is not vulnerable
- STABLE — 78.0.27

## How to determine if your server is up to date

The updated RPMs provided by cPanel should be at **least** 4.91-4 on versions 70 and 76 and at least 4.92 on versions 78 and above.

```perl
rpm -q exim
```

The output should resemble below:

- Versions 70 and 76 — `exim-4.91-4.cp1170.x86_64`

- Version 78 — `exim-4.92-1.cp1178.x86_64`

- Version 80 — `exim-4.92-1.cp1180.x86_64`


## What to do if you are not up to date.

If your server is **not** running one of the above versions, update **immediately**.

To upgrade your server, use WHM’s [_Upgrade to Latest Version_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/cpanel/upgrade-to-latest-version/) interface ( _WHM » Home » cPanel » Upgrade to Latest Version_).

Alternatively, you can run the commands below to upgrade your server from the command line:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>/scripts/upcp<br>/scripts/check_cpanel_rpms --fix --long-list<br>``` |

If you are on version 76 you will need to update your `/etc/cpupdate.conf` to look like the following:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>``` | ```go<br>CPANEL=11.76<br>RPMUP=daily<br>SARULESUP=daily<br>STAGING_DIR=/usr/local/cpanel<br>UPDATES=daily<br>``` |

After you complete this update (`/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/upcp`) set `/etc/cpupdate.conf`:

If you were on STABLE previously, set the following:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>``` | ```go<br>CPANEL=stable<br>RPMUP=daily<br>SARULESUP=daily<br>STAGING_DIR=/usr/local/cpanel<br>UPDATES=daily<br>``` |

If you were on RELEASE previously, set the following:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>``` | ```go<br>CPANEL=release<br>RPMUP=daily<br>SARULESUP=daily<br>STAGING_DIR=/usr/local/cpanel<br>UPDATES=daily<br>``` |

This will allow you to upgrade to newer versions of cPanel & WHM once you have migrated to EasyApache 4.

### Verify the new Exim RPM was installed

In version 78 run the following:

```perl
rpm -q exim
```

The output should resemble below:

```perl
exim-4.92-1.cp1178.x86_64
```

In versions 70 and 76 run the following:

```perl
rpm -q –changelog exim | grep CVE-2019-10149
```

The output should resemble below:

```perl
- Patch for CVE-2019-10149
```
