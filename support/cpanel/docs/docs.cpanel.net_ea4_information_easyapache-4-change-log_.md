## EasyApache 4 Change Logs

Last modified: _2025 February 20_

* * *

The EasyApache 4 change log is the authoritative list of changes to the EA4 product.

Until 2024, EasyApache 4 did **not** use versioning and organized changes by date only. Starting in 2025, we implemented a versioning system.

Each entry contains the following information:

1. The package that we changed.
2. The case number for the change.
3. A description of the change.

For more information about our GitHub repository, read our [The EasyApache 4 Git Repository and Build Updates](https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/git-repositories/the-easyapache-4-git-repository-and-build-updates/) documentation.
