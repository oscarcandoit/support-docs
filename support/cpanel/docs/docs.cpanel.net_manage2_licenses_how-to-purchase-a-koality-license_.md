## Overview

[koality](https://www.koality.io/en) provides e-commerce and website monitoring to secure your online store. It helps you prevent problems by continuously reviewing key business metrics and crawling your site.

## Purchase a koality license from Manage2

Important:

- To buy a koality license through Manage2, you **must** be a cPanel Partner.
- You **must** use the activation link to activate your koality license after purchasing it.

To purchase a koality license, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) interface.
In the _Licenses_ section, click _Add Licenses_.
2. Select the group and package to which you wish to add the koality license.
3. Select or enter the number of additional projects to add to the license. The cost of the additional koality projects will appear under the _Additional Projects_ text box.





Important:




You **must** enter the number of projects in the correct increments for the package. For example, the _koality Personal_ package uses increments of `1`, while the _koality Agency_ package uses increments of `30`.


4. Click _Add Licenses_.

A success message containing the activation link will appear at the top of the Manage2 interface.

- Follow the link to activate your koality license.
- You will also receive an email message with more details about your license.
