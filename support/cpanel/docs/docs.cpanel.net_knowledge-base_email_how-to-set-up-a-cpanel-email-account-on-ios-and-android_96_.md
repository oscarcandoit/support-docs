## Overview

Warning:

Because WebPros International, LLC doesn’t develop or ship these products, cPanel Technical Support **can’t** help you set up your email account on them. Contact your hosting provider if you need help.

This article provides instructions to set up a cPanel email account on an iOS® or Android™ device.

Note:

You can find your email account’s settings (for example, username, incoming server, and outgoing server) in the following locations:

- cPanel’s [_Set Up Mail Client_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_).
- The [Webmail](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/the-webmail-interface/) interface.
- The welcome email that your administrator sent you.

## Set up your mobile device

### iOS

Note:

This guide uses iOS 15 on an iPhone® SE. These instructions may differ on other iOS versions.

01. Tap _Settings_. Generally, the _Settings_ icon appears on one of your device’s main screens. The _Settings_ menu will appear.
02. Tap _Mail_. The _Mail_ menu will appear.
03. Tap _Accounts_. The _Accounts_ menu will appear.
04. Tap _Add Account_. The _Add Account_ menu will appear.
05. Tap _Other_. The _Other_ menu will appear.
06. Tap _Add Mail Account_. The _New Account_ interface will appear.
07. Enter your account information and tap _Next_. Enter the following information in the _New Account_ interface’s text boxes:

    - In the _Name_ text box, enter the name that you wish to use for the email account.
    - In the _Email_ text box, enter your email address.
    - In the _Password_ text box, enter the password for the email account.
    - In the _Description_ text box, enter a description for the email account.
    - Tap _Next_ to proceed to the next screen in the _New Account_ interface.
08. Use the toggle at the top of the screen to select a mailbox type. Verify all of the information for your account.






    Note:





    We recommend that you select the _IMAP_ mailbox type. If you select the _POP3_ mailbox type, the mobile device’s mail client will download all of the account’s email messages, and then remove the messages from the server. You will **not** be able to access those messages from any other mail client.

09. Enter the following information in the _Incoming Mail Server_ and _Outgoing Mail Server_ text boxes:

    - In the _Host Name_ text box, enter the mail server for the email account.
    - In the _User Name_ text box, enter your email address.
    - In the _Password_ text box, enter the password for the email account.
10. Tap _Next_ to proceed to the next screen in the _New Account_ interface.
11. Tap _Save_ to complete the account setup process. Your mail client is now ready.

### Android

Read our [How to Sync Calendars, Contacts, and Email on Android™ Devices](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/webmail/how-to-set-up-calendars-contacts-and-email-on-android-devices/) documentation.

04. In the _Add an account_ interface, tap _Personal (IMAP)_.
05. In the _Enter your email_ text box, enter your full email address. Tap _Next_.
