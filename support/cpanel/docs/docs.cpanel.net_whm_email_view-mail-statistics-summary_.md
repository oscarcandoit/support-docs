Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface displays statistics about the mail that your server sends and receives over a period of time. The date range for these statistics displays at the top of the interface.

The interface divides the list into the following sections:

### Grand total summary

This section displays statistics about the total number of messages that your server sends and receives, and all of the accounts that your server hosts.

- _TOTAL_ — Whether the data corresponds to received or delivered mail.
- _Volume_ — The total size of the messages, in kilobytes (KB).
- _Messages_ — The total number of messages.
- _Addresses_ — The total number of addresses that receive or send mail.






Note:




Due to an error in the `eximstats` process, this data may be incorrect.


- _Hosts_ — The total number of unique domains that send or receive mail.
- _At least one addr Delayed_ — The number of messages with at least one recipient whose mail server delayed the message.
- _At least one addr Failed_ — The number of messages with at least one recipient whose mail server rejected the message.

### Deliveries by Transport

This section displays statistics about the mail that your mail transfer agent (MTA) delivers.

- _local\_delivery_ — Messages that the system delivered from one user on your server to another user on your server.
- _remote\_smtp_ — Messages that the system delivered from a user on your server to a user on another server.
- _virtual\_userdelivery_ — Messages that the system forwarded from a virtual user on your server to a real user. This occurs if you set up a mail forwarder.

For each of these three types of sent mail, the section displays the following columns:

- _Volume_ — The total size of delivered messages.
- _Messages_ — The total number of delivered messages.

### Messages received per hour

This section displays the number of messages that your server received per hour over the last day. Use this section to determine the times when your traffic is highest.

### Deliveries per hour

This section displays the number of messages that your server delivered per hour over the last day. Use this section to determine the times when your traffic is highest.

### Time spent on the queue: all messages

This section displays the amount of time that messages waited in your mail queues before the server delivered them.

- _Time_ — The amount of time that the messages waited for the system to deliver them.
- _Under 1m_ — The system delivered the messages in under a minute.

  - _1h_ — The system delivered the messages in over a minute, but under an hour.
  - _1d_ — The system delivered the messages in over an hour, but under 24 hours.
  - _Over 1d_ — The system delivered the messages after 24 hours or more.
- _Messages_ — The number of messages that the system delivered.
- _Percentage_ — The percentage of messages that the system delivered in a specific amount of time.
- _Cumulative Percentage_ — The percentage of messages that the system delivered in a specific amount of time.

### Time spent on the queue: messages with a least one remote delivery

These statistics display the amount of time messages waited in your outgoing mail queue before the system delivered them to remote addresses.

- _Time_ — The amount of time that the messages waited for the system to deliver them.

  - _Under 1m_ — The system delivered the messages in under a minute.
  - _1h_ — The system delivered the messages in over a minute, but under an hour.
  - _1d_ — The system delivered the messages in over an hour, but under 24 hours.
  - _Over 1d_ — The system delivered the messages after 24 hours or more.
- _Messages_ — The number of messages that the system delivered.
- _Percentage_ — The percentage of messages that the system delivered in a specific amount of time.
- _Cumulative Percentage_ — The percentage of messages that the system delivered in a specific amount of time.

### Relayed messages

This section displays statistics about mail that the system sent from your server to remote destinations.

Warning:

Do **not** allow your server to operate as an open relay. Exim is **not** an open relay because it requires authentication for the system to send outbound messages. Messages that this section displays under _Relayed Messages_ do **not** indicate that the server is an open relay.
