## How to Purchase a cPanel License

Last modified: _2025 May 29_

* * *

## Overview

cPanel & WHM servers require a paid license from WebPros International, LLC in order to function. You **must** purchase a cPanel license for each cPanel & WHM server that you wish to run.

You can use the following methods to purchase a cPanel & WHM license:

- If this is a new installation, you can activate a free [15-day trial license](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-sign-up-for-a-trial-license) during initial configuration.
- If you are a cPanel Partner with access to [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/), you can purchase a license from within the [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) interface.
- You can purchase a license from the [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/). You **must** have a cPanel Store account with a verified email address.

Note:

- If you develop plugins or other applications for integration with cPanel & WHM, you may be eligible for a complimentary Developer License. For more information, read our [Obtain a cPanel Developer License](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/guides/quickstart-development-guide/quickstart-development-guide-obtain-a-cpanel-developer-license/) documentation.
- The refund period for license purchases is 72 hours. If you wish to request a refund for a recently-purchased license, contact [cPanel Customer Support](https://support.cpanel.net/requests/new).
- This document provides information to purchase a cPanel & WHM license. You can also purchase CloudLinux™ licenses through [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) and the [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/), but they are **not** the same as a cPanel & WHM license. You **must** purchase CloudLinux licenses separately.

## Purchase a license

### Purchase from WHM

#### Log in to WHM and start the license purchase process

1. On the server for which you wish to purchase a license, [log in to the WHM interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/how-to-log-in-to-your-server-or-account/) as the `root` user or as a reseller account with `root`-level privileges.
2. In the _Trial License_ banner at the top of the interface, click _Purchase a License_. A new interface will appear.

Important:

- If the _Trial License_ banner does not appear at the top of the interface, your server does **not** use a complimentary 15-day trial license and you **cannot** use this method to purchase a license.
- WHM users who do **not** possess `root`-level privileges can view the _Trial License_ banner, but **cannot** use this feature to purchase a license.

#### Log in to the cPanel Store

1. If you are already logged in to your cPanel Store account, the system will request access to this account.
2. Verify that the interface displays the correct cPanel Store username and server name, and then click _Allow Access_. A new interface will appear.

Note:

- To log in as a different cPanel Store account, click _Sign In as a Different User_ and log in to the desired cPanel Store account.
- To activate a new license, you **must** have a cPanel Store account with a verified email address.

#### Verify and complete your purchase

1. Verify your license order. When you purchase a license through the WHM interface, the system automatically selects the appropriate license type for your server and detects the IPv4 address to license. Currently, you can **only** purchase monthly licenses through the WHM interface.
2. Accept the legal agreements, enter or select the desired payment information, and then click _Complete Order_.
3. After the cPanel Store successfully processes your order, a confirmation message will appear. You will receive an invoice email from the cPanel Store. After you successfully purchase a license, the WHM interface will no longer display the _Trial License_ banner.

Note:

If the cPanel Store experiences problems with your order, an error message will appear. You may receive emails from cPanel Customer Service to help you resolve the issue.

### Purchase from cPanel Store or the Pricing page

#### Select the license you want to purchase

1. Start the cPanel license purchase process with one of the following methods:

- Navigate to the [cPanel Pricing](https://cpanel.net/pricing/) webpage
- Navigate to the [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/) and click _Browse Products_ in the _cPanel Licenses_ section.
- Log in to your cPanel Store account and click _Order New Services_ in the _Orders/Licenses_ menu.

2. Locate the license type that you wish to purchase, and click _Order Now_. The _Configure_ interface will appear.






Note:





If you accessed the process through the cPanel Pricing page, click _Add to Cart_ instead.


The _Configure_ page will appear.

#### Configure your license

The _Configure_ page shows the items currently in your cart along with the details for the cPanel license tier.

1. Enter the IP address for the license. The cPanel Store automatically verifies that the address is valid and not associated with another license. You **must** enter a new IP address for each cPanel product.
2. Select any addons you wish to purchase, if any.
3. Click _Continue_. The _Review & Checkout_ page will appear.






Note:





- The system automatically prorates prices for the _Monthly_ license term.
- Months after the prorated time will incur their full monthly charge.

#### Review your order

The _Review & Checkout_ page displays all of the items that you added to your shopping cart.

1. Verify that the order includes the correct license type and IP addresses before you continue.
   - To update a license type or IP address, click _Edit_.
   - To add more products to your order, click _Continue Shopping_.
2. Click _Checkout_ to continue.

#### Checkout

1. In the _Order Summary_ section, review the items in your order.
2. In the _Choose Account_ section, select the account that you want use to purchase the license. You can also choose to create a new account.
3. In the _Terms & Conditions_ section, review the agreements, then select the checkbox to indicate that you agree to the terms.






Important:





Before you can complete the purchase process, you **must** accept WebPros International, LLC’s legal agreements.

4. In the _Payment Details_ section, select your desired payment type, and enter the appropriate information or follow the displayed instructions to complete your payment.
5. Click _Complete Order_ to complete the purchase.

Note:

Many first-time license purchasers will need to provide additional proof of identity in order to complete the purchase process. If your order requires this additional verification, cPanel Customer Support will contact you.

#### Review your invoice

After you click _Complete Purchase_ to finalize your order, an invoice page will appear, and the system will send a confirmation email.

You can click _Print Page_ to print a copy of your invoice.

### Purchase from Manage2

#### Log in to Manage2

Log in to your [Manage2](https://manage2.cpanel.net/) account, and then navigate to the [_Add License_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/add-license/) interface ( _Dashboard » Licenses » Add License_).

#### Enter the required license information

1. In the [_Add License_](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/add-license/) interface ( _Dashboard » Licenses » Add License_), use the available text boxes and menus to specify the following:

   - The server’s IP address
   - Group
   - Package
   - License type and term
2. Click _Add License_.
3. A confirmation message will appear.
