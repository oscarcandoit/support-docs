## Overview

This document explains how to create an email account and connect to it.

## Create email account

To quickly create a new email account, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to cPanel’s [_Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-accounts/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_).

![cpanel interface email section highlighting email accounts](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/create-an-email-step1.png)

For more options and information about this interface, read our [_Create an Email Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/create-an-email-account/) documentation.

## Use Webmail to check your account

To check your email account through Webmail, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to `https://example.com:2096` in your preferred browser, where `example.com` represents your domain name.
2. Enter the username part of your email address in the _Email Address_ text box (for example, `username` for the `username@example.com` address).
3. Enter your password in the _Password_ text box.
4. Click _Log in_.

For more information, read our [The Webmail Interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/the-webmail-interface/) documentation.

## Configure a device to check your email

To set up an iOS® or Android™ device to check your email, read our [How to Set Up a cPanel Email Account on iOS® and Android™](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/email/how-to-set-up-a-cpanel-email-account-on-ios-and-android/) documentation. It includes helpful steps and screenshots that will walk you through the process.

## Configure a client to check your email

cPanel provides configuration scripts for many popular mail clients.

1. Navigate to the cPanel’s [_Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-accounts/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_).
2. Click _Connect Devices_.
3. Locate the mail client you will be using in the _Application_ section of the _Mail Client Automatic Configuration Scripts_ section.
4. Review the system’s instructions, then click _Proceed_ to continue. The system will then attempt to download the script. If it prompts you to open, run, or save the script file, select _Run_ or _Open_ to continue.
5. The system may ask if you are sure you want to install the script file. Select _Continue_ or _Yes_ to continue the installation.
6. The system may prompt you for the email account’s password. Enter the password and click _Install_.
7. When you complete the process, your mail client will open and log in to your email account. If your account has a lot of email, it will take a while to download and synchronize.

If your mail client does not appear in the list, read the [Mail Client Manual Settings](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client/#mail-client-manual-settings) section of our [Set Up Mail Client](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/set-up-mail-client/) documentation.

## Set up your calendar and contacts

To set up calendars and contacts on MacOS® or iOS®, read our [How to Set Up Calendars and Contacts](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/webmail/how-to-set-up-calendars-and-contacts/) documentation.

## Remove access to email

To disable access to email, remove the account from the device that is accessing the email. If you do not have access to the device, change the password to the email account using the [_Security_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/manage-email-accounts/#security) section of cPanel’s [_Manage Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/manage-email-accounts/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email accounts » Manage_).
