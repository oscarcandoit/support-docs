## How to Log in to the Sent and Spam Mail Folders Directly

Last modified: _2022 November 23_

* * *

## Overview

This document describes how to directly log in to your `sent` or `spam` mail folder in one easy step.

## Log in to your sent or spam mail folder

To log in to your `sent` or `spam` mail folder, perform the following steps:

1. Open your mail client.

2. Modify your login username as follows:
   - If you are the main cPanel account owner, append `/sent` or `/spam` to your username. For example, `joe/sent` or `joe/spam`.
   - If you are not the main cPanel account owner, append `/sent` or `/spam` to your email address. For example, `joe@example.com/sent` or `joe@example.com/spam`.
3. cPanel will open your `sent` or `spam` folder.


## Compatibility with mail clients

- Your ability to access this feature from a mobile device will depend on your service provider.
- This feature should work with most standalone mail clients. However, this feature is not available from our cPanel-provided webmail clients.
