Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature scans the server’s bound IP addresses in order to locate IP addresses that are not linked to a domain.

## Rebuild the IP address pool

If the system determines that there are available, unused IP addresses, it places those IP addresses back into the IP address pool. When you create new accounts, cPanel & WHM uses the addresses from this pool.

To rebuild the IP address pool, click _Proceed_. After the scan finishes, the interface displays the number of free IP addresses in your IP address pool.
