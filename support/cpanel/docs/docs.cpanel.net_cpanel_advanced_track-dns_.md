Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

This interface contains tools to help you retrieve network information. For example, you can look up an IP address or trace the route from your computer to the computer that hosts your website.

## Domain Lookup

The _Domain Lookup_ tool executes the host domain command, where domain represents a specific domain. This command resolves an IP address from a specified domain name, and returns general DNS information about the server.

To look up a domain, perform the following steps:

1. Enter the domain to look up in the _Enter a domain to look up_ text box.
2. Click _Look Up_.

The domain’s mail servers and IP address will display. You can also view the domain’s DNS information under the _Zone Information_ heading.

## Trace Route

The _Trace Route_ function traces the route that your computer takes to access your website. This function displays how many servers through which your data passes before it reaches your website. This information also includes the amount of time that your computer requires to reach the server.

To trace the route to your server, click _Trace_. The interface will display the pathways that your computer follows to reach your server.

Note:

You may not possess access to this function. Contact your system administrator for more information about how to use the _Trace Route_ function.
