Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

This interface allows you to choose to view the cPanel interface in many different languages.

Note:

- When you change the interface’s language, the system sets a cookie in your browser that expires after one year. You must perform this step each time that you log in to webmail from a new browser, whenever you delete cookies, and after the cookie expires.

- There is also an option to [change the login interface locale](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/how-to-log-in-to-your-server-or-account/#change-the-login-interface-locale) for cPanel, WHM, or Webmail during the login process, which will change the default language for the interface.


## Change the language

To change your cPanel interface’s language, perform the following steps:

1. Select the language that you wish to use from the _Select a language_ menu.
2. Click _Change_. The interface will refresh in the newly-selected language.

Note:

If your browser’s `Accept-Language` header is set, the login interface will attempt to display the locale that corresponds to your browser setting. If the locale that the browser’s header requests is not available, the login interface will appear in English.

## Supported languages

Note:

We have deprecated our legacy locales. For more information, read the [cPanel Deprecation Plan](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-deprecation-plan).

We support the following languages:

- English
- German
- Japanese
- Russian
- Spanish
