## How to Manage a Site Quality Monitoring Subscription

Last modified: _2025 April 4_

* * *

## Overview

The [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_) offers subscriptions with increased monitoring capabilities to watch your websites for common issues so you can optimize quickly.

Important:

- Subscriptions are **only** available if your hosting provider enables WebPros, International LLC to provide them.
- This document covers subscription management. For information about subscription activation, read our [How to Activate a Site Quality Monitoring Subscription](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-activate-a-site-quality-monitoring-subscription/) documentation.

## Free subscription provisions

Each Site Quality Monitoring user has access to **one**`Free` subscription. When you upgrade your `Free` subscription, we automatically grant you another one. A `Free` subscription allows you to monitor one root domain and one URL associated with that domain.

## Maximum subscription number

Each Site Quality Monitoring user can monitor up to ten websites at a time. Your `Free` subscription does **not** count towards this maximum. However, once you are monitoring ten websites, you will not be able to upgrade your `Free` subscription.

## How to manage a Site Quality Monitoring subscription

When you [add a new monitored website](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/#add-a-new-monitored-website), you can set its subscription type. You can also manage monitored website subscriptions in the following ways:

### Upgrade a subscription

You may upgrade a Site Quality Monitoring subscription plan to increase your monitoring capabilities - for example, by adding the configurable monitoring extensions in the [_Extras_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-extras/) tab.

You can upgrade your subscription through the following methods in the [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_):

- [_Upgrade subscription_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/#upgrade-subscription)
- [The _Integrations_ tab](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-extras/#integrations)

### Downgrade a subscription

To downgrade a subscription, remove the website whose monitoring capabilities you intend to reduce from Site Quality Monitoring, then add it again. We will automatically assign it a `Free` subscription that you can upgrade later.

You can remove a website from monitoring through the [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface’s [_User settings_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/#user-settings) menu ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_).

### Assign an unassigned subscription

When you remove a monitored website from monitoring in the [_Monitored website manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/site-quality-monitoring-settings/) menu in the [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_), you have the option to cancel its associated subscription. If you do **not** cancel the associated subscription, it becomes unassigned.

To assign an unassigned subscription to an existing monitored website, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [_User settings_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/#user-settings) menu.
2. Click _Manage subscriptions_. Your subscription list will appear.
3. Click the _Monitor new website_ button of the subscription you wish to assign. The system will return you to the _All monitored websites_ section and the _Monitor new website_ menu will appear.
4. Enter the website information that you want to monitor.
5. Click _Save_ to begin monitoring it with your reassigned subscription’s capabilities.

## Access Site Quality Monitoring without cPanel

To regain access to your Site Quality Monitoring account without using cPanel, visit the [Site Quality Monitoring website](https://site-quality-monitoring.com/) and perform the following steps:

1. Click _Forgot password?_. The password reset interface will appear.
2. Enter the email address you used to sign up for Site Quality Monitoring in the _Email_ text box. You will receive an email to reset your password.
3. Click _Reset your password_.
4. Enter a new password and save it. You will return to the log in interface.
5. Log in. The [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring) interface will appear.
