## Upgrade Blockers

Last modified: _2025 September 24_

* * *

## Overview

When you upgrade to a newer version of cPanel & WHM or install cPanel & WHM on a new server, the system checks for compatibility with the version of cPanel & WHM that you wish to install. **Blockers** are conditions that don’t allow the cPanel & WHM update process (`upcp`) to install or upgrade to a particular version.

Warning:

Before you upgrade the cPanel & WHM version on a server, we **strongly** recommend that you restore cPanel & WHM’s management of all FTP targets on your server. If the FTP package’s target is set to `unmanaged` on a server that you wish to upgrade, you may encounter problems in the cPanel interface. For more information, read our [How to Set or Unset Package Management](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/package-management/how-to-set-or-unset-package-management) documentation.

Before you begin a new installation, read our [_Installation Guide_](https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide) documentation. The cPanel & WHM installation and upgrade processes require **at least** 5 GB of disk space in the `/usr/local/cpanel` directory.

## Upgrades across multiple major versions

Warning:

- After you upgrade to a new major version of cPanel & WHM, you **cannot** downgrade to a previous major version.
- If you are upgrading from a very old version of cPanel & WHM, you may experience problems.
  - To resolve this issue, manually upgrade to an intermediate version using the [/etc/cpupdate.conf](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/the-cpanel-update-configuration-file-cpupdate-conf) file. Then, you can proceed to the final target version.
  - If you need assistance, contact [cPanel Technical Support](http://tickets.cpanel.net/).

If you run an update that includes multiple cPanel & WHM major version upgrades, the cPanel & WHM update process (`upcp`) will upgrade your server to each intermediate version. The update process performs compatibility checks for each intermediate version prior to each upgrade.

#### Example

For example, after a system administrator runs an update on a server that runs cPanel & WHM version 80, and the target version is cPanel & WHM version 86, the cPanel & WHM update process (`upcp`) performs the following actions:

1. The update process detects that the system must first upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 82.
2. The update process performs compatibility checks for the upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 82.
   - If the system is compatible, the update process upgrades cPanel & WHM to version 82.
   - If the system is **not** compatible, the update process sends a list of the compatibility issues to the system administrator, and the server remains on cPanel & WHM version 80.
3. After the upgrade to version 82 is complete, the update process performs compatibility checks for the upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 84.
   - If the system is compatible, the update process upgrades cPanel & WHM to version 84.
   - If the system is **not** compatible, the update process sends a list of the compatibility issues to the system administrator, and the server remains on cPanel & WHM version 82.
4. After the upgrade to version 84 is complete, the update process performs compatibility checks for the upgrade to cPanel & WHM version 86.
   - If the system is compatible, the update process upgrades cPanel & WHM to version 86.
   - If the system is **not** compatible, the update process sends a list of the compatibility issues to the system administrator, and the server remains on cPanel & WHM version 84.

## System and software checks

The cPanel & WHM update and installation processes perform two types of check:

- **Standard** — Standard checks apply to all installations and upgrades.
- **Version-specific** — Version-specific checks are specific requirements for the version of cPanel & WHM that you’re installing or upgrading.

If cPanel & WHM encounters a compatibility issue that blocks the installation or upgrade process, the following events happen:

1. If you started an upgrade, the system remains at the last known compatible version. If you started a new installation of cPanel & WHM, the system remains in its pre-installation state.
2. cPanel & WHM sends a list of the blockers to the system administrator.
3. The installation or upgrade process exits.

## Standard upgrade checks

When you run an upgrade of cPanel & WHM to any version, the update process performs the following standard checks:

#### License files

You **cannot** upgrade cPanel & WHM if any of the following conditions are true:

- The cPanel & WHM update process cannot find a valid cPanel & WHM license file.
  - Without the license file, cPanel & WHM cannot function properly and will block all updates.
  - You **must** purchase a valid license in order to upgrade, downgrade, or use cPanel & WHM.
- The cPanel & WHM update process cannot read your cPanel & WHM license file.
  - To fix this issue, run the `/usr/local/cpanel/cpkeyclt` script.
  - If the problem persists, [contact our support staff](http://tickets.cpanel.net/).
- Your server’s license is no longer eligible for updates.

If you experience difficulties with your license, [contact our customer service department](http://www.cpanel.net/contact.html).

#### Read-only file systems

To ensure that the system can write files to critical directories, the cPanel & WHM update process will fail if the following directories file systems exist in a read-only state:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>``` | ```bash<br>/etc<br>/var<br>/var/lib/rpm<br>/var/cpanel<br>/usr/local<br>/usr/local/cpanel<br>/usr/local/bin<br>/usr/bin<br>/tmp<br>/var/tmp<br>``` |

#### RPM database integrity

The update process on servers not running the Ubuntu® operating system verifies the integrity of the RPM database.

- To verify the integrity of the RPM database, the update process installs and uninstalls a test RPM.
- The update process attempts to repair the problem, but if it cannot repair the RPM database, the upgrade attempt fails.

## Version requirements and blockers

Warning:

If a blocker for the version of cPanel & WHM to which you wish to upgrade is present on your system when you start the cPanel & WHM update process, the update process will **fail**.
