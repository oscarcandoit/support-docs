## Overview

The _Calendars and Contacts Management_ interface allows you to display, create, delete, and rename calendars, address books, and task lists.

Note:

This feature also appears in the [Webmail interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/the-webmail-interface/).

## The Calendars and Contacts Management table

The _Calendars and Contacts Management_ table displays the following columns:

- _Name_ — The name of the calendar, address book, or task list.
- _Type_ — The type of the calendar, address book, or task list.
- _Description_ — A description of the calendar, address book, or task list.
- _Actions_ — The available actions to perform on the calendar, address book, or task list.

## The Collection Editor interface

Use the _Collection Editor_ interface to create, delete, or rename calendars, address books, and task lists. In this interface, a [collection](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#collection) is a set of events in a calendar, contacts in an address book, or tasks in a task list.

### Create a collection

To create a new collection, perform the following actions:

1. In the _Calendars and Contacts Management_ interface, click _Create_. The _Collection Editor_ interface appears.
2. In the _Collection Type_ menu, select _Calendar_ for a calendar, _Address book_ for an address book, or _Task List_ for a task list.
3. In the _Collection Name_ text box, enter a name for the calendar, address book, or task list.
4. If you selected _Calendar_, the _Color_ button appears.

1. Select the _Color_ button. A color palette appears.
2. Select the color for the calendar.
5. Enter an optional description in the _Description_ text box.
6. Click _Submit_. The [_Calendars and Contacts Management_ table](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/calendars-and-contacts-management/#the-calendars-and-contacts-management-table) appears, along with a success message. The new calendar, address book, or task list appears in the table.

To delete an existing collection, perform the following actions:

1. In the [_Calendars and Contacts Management_ table](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/calendars-and-contacts-management/#the-calendars-and-contacts-management-table), find the calendar, address book, or task list you want to delete.
2. Click the trash can icon (![trash can icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/trashcan.png)) in the _Actions_ column.
