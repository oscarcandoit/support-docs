Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

The _System_ section includes the following settings:

| Setting | Description | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Accounts that can access a cPanel user account:_ | This setting allows you to specify which users can log in to a cPanel account. If you disallow `root` or reseller logins to cPanel accounts, the disallowed `root` user or reseller cannot access the cPanel icon in WHM’s [_List Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-information/list-accounts/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Information » List Accounts_), which provides access to the user’s cPanel account. | - _Root, Account-Owner, and cPanel User_ — Allow the `root` user, the owner (the `root` user or reseller), and the cPanel user.<br>- _Account-Owner and cPanel User Only_ — Allow the owner (the `root` user or reseller) and the cPanel user.<br>- _cPanel User Only_ — Allow only the cPanel user. | _Root, Account-Owner, and cPanel User_ |
| _Allow server-info and server-status_ | This setting allows you to specify additional IP addresses and hostnames that can access the `example.com/server-status` page, where `example.com` represents a domain’s name.<br>- If you install the `mod_info` Apache module, this setting also applies to the `example.com/server-info` page.<br>- cPanel & WHM does **not** install the `mod_info` Apache module by default. To use this module, you **must** install it in EasyApache 4.<br>Note:<br>We **strongly** recommend that you use caution when you allow access to these pages. They display sensitive information about your server. | Enter the desired IP addresses or hostnames in the text box, one IP address or hostname per line. | N/A |
| _Allow cPanel users to install SSL Hosts._ | This setting allows you to specify whether to allow cPanel users to install SSL hosts. If you disable this setting, cPanel users can’t enable the _Force HTTPS Redirects_ option for any domain in cPanel’s [_Domains_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/domains/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Domains_). | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _On_ |
| _Apache non-SSL IP/port_ | This setting allows you to specify a new port or IP address that Apache uses to listen for requests and serve web pages over an unsecured connection.<br>Important:<br>This setting can deny HTTP traffic the ability to route correctly, which renders your site inaccessible to visitors. | - _0.0.0.0:80_ — Cause Apache to use port 80 to serve content on an unsecured connection for all of your server’s IP addresses.<br>- Select the text box and enter a port or IP address. Enter an IP address to prevent Apache’s ability to listen on all other IP addresses. | _0.0.0.0:80_ |
| _Apache SSL port_ | This setting allows you to specify a new port or IP address that Apache uses to listen for requests and serve web pages over a secure connection. <br>Important:<br>This setting can deny HTTPS traffic the ability to route correctly, which renders your site inaccessible to visitors. | - _0.0.0.0:443_ — Cause Apache to use port 443 to serve content on a secured connection for all of your server’s IP addresses.<br>- Select the text box and enter a port or IP address. Enter an IP address to prevent Apache’s ability to listen on all other IP addresses. | _0.0.0.0:443_ |
| _cPanel & WHM API shell (for developers)_ | This setting allows you to add the following interfaces, which allow the `root` user and resellers to test API functions directly:<br>- WHM’s [_API Shell_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/development/api-shell-for-whm) interface ( _WHM » Home » Development » API Shell_)<br>- cPanel’s [_API Shell_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/advanced/api-shell-for-cpanel/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Advanced » API Shell_)<br>To enable this feature for cPanel, you **must** grant the _API Shell_ feature to the desired `root` user and resellers in WHM’s [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM » Home » Packages » Feature Manager_), then refresh your browser window. | - _On_ — Allow.<br>- _Off_ — Deny. | _Off_ |
| _DNS server reload deferral time_ | This setting allows you to define a time, in seconds, that the `dnsadmin` service waits before it restarts the DNS server. The system silently discards additional restart requests in this time period.<br>Note:<br>- You **cannot** set a value greater than `300` seconds.<br>- For busy servers, we recommend a higher value. A higher value will help to prevent multiple subsequent restarts.<br>- If your system experiences very few DNS changes, we recommend that you use a setting of `5`.<br>- DNS changes will **not** take effect until the DNS server reloads. | - _2 s_ — Two seconds.<br>- Select the text box and enter a value. | _2 s_ |
| _HTTPD deferred reload time_ | This setting allows you to specify the number of seconds that the system waits before it restarts the web server. The system silently discards additional restart requests in this time period. | - _0 s_ — Don’t wait.<br>- Select the text box and enter a value. | _0 s_ |
| _The number of seconds between ChkServd service checks._ | This setting allows you to specify the number of seconds between each `chkservd` daemon service check. If you choose to set a value below `300`, we recommend that you first use the `/var/log/chkservd.log` file to verify the length of your system’s `chkservd` checks. The settings that you choose in WHM’s [_Service Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/service-manager/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Service Configuration » Service Manager_) affect the length of these checks. | - Minimum value: `60`<br>- Maximum value: `7200` | `300` |
| _The number of times ChkServd allows a previous check to complete before termination._ | This setting allows you to specify the number of times that the `chkservd` daemon allows a check to complete before termination. | - Minimum value: `1`<br>- Maximum value: `20` | `2` |
| _The option to enable or disable ChkServd HTML notifications._ | This setting allows you to enable or disable HTML notifications from the `chkservd` daemon. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _On_ |
| _The option to enable or disable ChkServd recovery notifications._ | This setting allows you to enable or disable recovery notifications from the `chkservd` daemon. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _On_ |
| _Conserve memory_ | This setting allows you to specify whether to conserve memory (RAM) at the expense of more CPU usage and disk I/O. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |
| _cpsrvd username domain lookup_ | This setting allows you to specify whether WHM automatically supplies a username (based on the account name) when a cPanel user enters a login password. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |
| _Prevent cpsrvd from serving standard HTTP ports_ | This setting prevents the `cpsrvd` daemon from taking over the standard HTTP ports when you disable the system’s [web server](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-use-server-profiles/) role.<br>Important:<br>This action renders any cPanel & WHM features that depend on the standard HTTP ports partially or entirely unusable. These features include service subdomains, AutoSSL, Mailman, and BoxTrapper. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |
| _Cache disk quota information_ | This setting allows you to specify whether WHM caches disk usage information.<br>Note:<br>- If you **enable** this setting, the cache process may result in disk-usage information that is up to 15 minutes out-of-date.<br>- If you **disable** this setting, your server may experience a large performance degradation. | - _On_ — Enable. <br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _On_ |
| _Recursive DNS query pool size_ | This setting restricts the maximum number of currently active recursive DNS queries. Use this setting if your firewall imposes rate limits on DNS queries. These rate limits can degrade recursive DNS queries in applications such as AutoSSL. | - _Unrestricted_ — Disable.<br>- _10_ — Restrict to 10 currently active recursive DNS queries.<br>- Select the text box and enter a value. | _10_ |
| _Reverse DNS lookup upon connect_ | This setting allows you to specify whether cPanel & WHM attempts to resolve a client’s IP address to a domain name whenever a user connects to a cPanel service.<br>Important:<br>If you enable this setting, it may **degrade** your server’s performance. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |
| _Maximum age, in days, of content to keep when automatically emptying the users’ File Manager Trash_ | This setting determines how many days to keep files in the `.trash` folder of user home directories. These folders contain deleted files from cPanel’s [_File Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/file-manager/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Files » File Manager_). | - _Disabled_ — Disabled.<br>- Select the text box and enter a value.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Note:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A value of `0` configures the server to purge all files from every user’s `.trash` folder, regardless of age. | _Disabled_ |
| _Enable optimizations for the C compiler_ | This setting allows you to specify whether the compiler optimizes code for your system. On some systems, compiler optimizations can trigger a **bug** in system libraries. | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |
| _Max HTTP submission size_ | This setting allows you to specify the maximum file size in Megabytes (MB) that a user can upload to your server. This setting applies to all uploads and form submissions in cPanel & WHM, which includes Webmail, cPanel’s [_File Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/file-manager/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Files » File Manager_), and phpMyAdmin. | - _Unlimited_ — Allow any file size.<br>- Select the text box and enter a number between `1` and `10,240`. | _Unlimited_ |
| _File upload required free space_ | This setting allows you to specify the minimum filesystem quota space that the system requires after a file uploads to your server. This setting applies to all uploads and form submissions in cPanel & WHM, which includes Webmail, cPanel’s [_File Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/file-manager/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Files » File Manager_), and phpMyAdmin.<br>- This helps ensure that users do not meet or exceed their quota limits.<br>- We enable quotas by **default** on new installations. | - _5 MB_ — Allow a minimum of 5 MB of free disk space.<br>- Select the text box and enter a number. | _5 MB_ |
| _Interval, in days, between rebuilds of the FTP quota and disk usage data (applies to Pure-FTPd only)_ | This setting allows you to specify the number of days between rebuilds of the FTP quota and disk usage data for Pure-FTP. This interval allows the system to consider account disk usage information for files that other processes modify or add to a user’s root FTP directory.<br>Note:<br>- A **higher** setting reduces disk I/O, but lowers the accuracy of the usage data.<br>- A **lower** setting improves accuracy, but consumes more disk I/O. | - _30_ — 30 days.<br>- Select the text box and enter a number between `1` and `365,000`. | _30_ |
| _Depth to recurse for .htaccess checks_ | This setting allows you to specify the maximum number of directories deep to look for `.htaccess` files when you change the PHP handler.<br>For example, if the `/home/user/public_html/` directory is your document root, and `2` is the value for this setting, the system searches the following directories for `.htaccess` files:<br>- `/home/user/public_html/`<br>- `/home/user/public_html/directory1/`<br>- `/home/user/public_html/directory2/`<br>The system does **not** search the `/home/user/public_html/directory1/directorya/` directory.<br>Note:<br>This setting also comments out any `AddHandler` directive lines in your users’ `.htaccess` files that change how the system handles PHP. | - _2_ — Two directories.<br>- Select the text box and enter a number that is greater than `0`.<br>Important:<br>We **strongly** recommend that you **do not** enter a value that is higher than `10`. A value that is higher than `10` can degrade your server’s performance. | _2_ |
| _Account Invites for Subaccounts_ | This settings allow cPanel account users to send invitations to new Subaccount users via cPanel’s [_User Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/user-manager/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Preferences » User Manager_). An invitation includes a link to a time-sensitive page where the Subaccount user can set their own password rather than rely on the cPanel account user to set their password.<br>Note:<br>When you disable this option, the system **disables** the _Send login link to alternate email address._ setting in cPanel’s [_Create an Email Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/create-an-email-account) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Create an Email Account_). | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _On_ |
| _Listen on IPv6 Addresses_ | This setting causes the `cpsrvd` daemon and other cPanel & WHM services to listen on IPv6.<br>Note:<br>- If you do not enable this setting, WHM, cPanel, Webmail, and Web Disk will **not** function via IPv6.<br>- After you enable this setting, you **must** rebuild Apache and run the following scripts from the command line:<br>  - `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/restartsrv_apache`<br>  - `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/restartsrv_cpsrvd`<br>  - `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/restartsrv_cpdavd`<br>  - `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/restartsrv_nsd` | - _On_ — Enable.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |

| _Use cPanel® jailshell by default_ | This setting allows you to configure accounts to use the cPanel® jailshell by default. Jailed shell systems, by default, mount all filesystems with the `nosetuid` option. The `nosetuid` option blocks the operation of `setuid` and `setgid` commands, such as the `ping` command. However, this does **not** apply to Exim’s `/usr/sbin/` directory. For more information, read our [How to Create Custom Jailed Shell Mounts](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-create-custom-jailed-shell-mounts) documentation. | - _On_ — Enable. We **strongly** recommend that you **enable** this setting.<br>- _Off_ — Disable. | _Off_ |
| _Jailed /proc mount method ( \* Choosing this option will create a limited /proc mount for legacy operating systems.)_ | This setting allows you to permit the use of the `/proc` virtual filesystem in a jailshell. For more information, read our [VirtFS Jailed Shell](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/virtfs-jailed-shell/) documentation. | - _Always mount a full /proc_ — The `/proc` virtual filesystem has full privileges.<br>- _Full /proc for [supported operating systems](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/third-party/third-party-software-end-of-life-policy/#how-long-will-cpanel-support-my-chosen-operating-system) and xenpv_ <br>  - In the AlmaLinux OS 8, Rocky Linux 8, CentOS 7, CloudLinux 7 and 8, and RHEL 7 operating systems, the `/proc` virtual filesystem includes all processes.<br>- _No /proc for [supported operating systems](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/third-party/third-party-software-end-of-life-policy/#how-long-will-cpanel-support-my-chosen-operating-system) and xenpv_ <br>  - In the AlmaLinux OS 8, Rocky Linux 8, CentOS 7, CloudLinux 7 and 8, and RHEL 7 operating systems, the system does not mount the `/proc` virtual filesystem inside the jail. | _Full /proc for [supported operating systems](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/third-party/third-party-software-end-of-life-policy/#how-long-will-cpanel-support-my-chosen-operating-system) and xenpv_ |
| _Jailed /bin mounted suid_ | This setting allows you to permit the use of the `setuid` option in the `/bin` directory in a jailshell. System administrators who wish to run `setuid` commands, such as the `/bin/ping` command, may wish to use this setting.
