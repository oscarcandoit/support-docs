## Account History

Last modified: _2020 September 29_

* * *

## Overview

The _Account History_ interface displays your account’s billing history.

Important:

The following information appears at the top of the interface:

- _Terms Net_ — The number of days before any invoices are overdue.
- _Account Number_ — Use this number when you contact [cPanel Customer Service](mailto:cs@cpanel.net) with account questions.

## Selection Filter

The _Selection Filter_ feature allows you to specify the transactions that the interface displays or locate a particular payment. To use this feature, select from the following _Selection Filter_ options and click _Go_:

- _Transaction Types_ — The invoice’s billing item type or the payment that Manage2 associates with the account.
- _Transaction Methods_ — The payment type that Manage2 uses to process the invoice.






Note:





The options that appear in the menu correspond with your access level.

- _Max Shown_ — The maximum number of results that the interface displays. This value defaults to `35`.
- _Date Range_ — The date range within which a transaction occurred.
- _Transaction Amount_ — The total transaction amount, in US dollars.

Note:

To sort search results by the date on which the transactions posted, click the arrows next to the _Post Date_ heading.

## Account Balance chart

The _Show Balance History_ link appears directly below the _Selection Filter_ feature. Click _Show Balance History_ to view a chart of your account’s balance over time.

## Transaction table

Below the _Selection Filter_ feature, the interface displays the following table with the transactions that match your filter options:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Type_ | The type of transaction. <br>Note:<br>All fully or partically past due invoices display in orange. |
| _Post Date_ | The date that Manage2 posted the transaction. |
| (no title) | This column contains `.pdf` and `HTML` copies of your invoice. |
| _Amount (USD)_ | The transaction amount, in US Dollars (USD). |
| _Method_ | The payment method, refund, or the invoice’s billing item. |
| _Reference_ | The transaction’s reference number. |
| _Notes_ | Any notes about the transaction. |
| _Staff Notes_ | Any additional notes that the Customer Service staff created about the transaction. |
| _Balance_ | The account’s remaining balance. |

The most recent transactions display at the top of the table. Your current account balance appears below the table.

## License reactivation

When you reactivate a license, Manage2 prompts you to agree to the license fee amount.

To avoid a license reactivation fee, wait 48 hours after Manage2 generates your monthly invoice before you reactivate the license.

If you reactivate a license within the 48 hours after Manage2 generated your invoice, check your account before you make a payment to ensure that you pay the full amount.
