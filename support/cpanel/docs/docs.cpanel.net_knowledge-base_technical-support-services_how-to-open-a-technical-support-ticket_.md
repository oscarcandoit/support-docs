  - Navigate to the _Contact cPanel_ section of WHM’s [_Support Center_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/support/support-center) interface ( _WHM » Home » Support » Support Center_).

  - Log in to the server as a `root`-level user and run the `/usr/local/cpanel/cpanel -S` command.


Note:

If you are a cPanel Partner, you do not need to provide a Support Access ID.

## Submit a support request

You can submit a support request using the following methods:

### The Create Support Ticket interface

You can open a support request with cPanel Technical Support in WHM’s [_Create Support Ticket_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/support/create-support-ticket) interface ( _WHM » Home » Support » Create Support Ticket_). This interface guides you through the support request creation process and helps identify your support request requirements. It also automates the SSH authorization process.

### The cPanel Customer Portal

To submit a request for cPanel Technical Support, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [_cPanel Customer Portal_](https://tickets.cpanel.net/) interface. The _cPanel Customer Portal_ uses the same login details as your [cPanel Store](https://store.cpanel.net/) account.

2. Click _Submit a Request_. You can find this at the top of the _cPanel Customer Portal_.

3. Follow the prompts to complete your support request.


After you complete your support request, you will receive an email confirmation. This email contains your support request’s ID. It also provides information about how to [grant cPanel Technical Support access to your server](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/technical-support-services/how-to-open-a-technical-support-ticket/#grant-cpanel-technical-support-access-to-your-server).
