Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature allows you to upload a locale in XML format to your server. After you upload a locale, your users can select it from within the cPanel interface.

- If the locale does not already exist on your server, the system creates all necessary files.
- If the locale exists on your server, the system performs the following actions:
  - Core files — The system only adds keys from the XML data that do not already exist. The system does not overwrite any keys.
  - Local edit files — The system overwrites keys on the server with the XML data, and adds any keys that do not already exist.

## Upload an XML File

To upload an existing locale, perform the following steps:

1. Click _Choose File_.
2. Select the XML file that you wish to upload.
3. Click _Upload_ to complete the process.
