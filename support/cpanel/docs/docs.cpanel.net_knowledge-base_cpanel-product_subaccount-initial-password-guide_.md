## Overview

This document explains a Subaccount user’s experience when you request that they set their initial password.

## New Subaccount invitations

In the _Add User_ section of cPanel’s [_User Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/user-manager/) interface ( _cPanel_ » _Home_ » _Preferences_ » _User Manager_), you can prompt the Subaccount user to set their initial password. When you select that option, the following details the user’s experience:

Note:

To start the process, create a new Subaccount and select the _The user will set the account password._ option.


1. The Subaccount user will receive a welcome email.




```text
From: cPanel for example on example.com <sample1@example.com>
Subject: [example.com] Welcome to your new account: john@example.com
To: john.connor@example1.com

Welcome to example.com!
Your new account username is john@example.com.

Note: Before you can use your new account, you must set your password at the following URL: https://server.example.com:2083/invitation?user=john@example.com&cookie=wWqqnW3aLzrSDdyX

The system generated this notice on Thursday, Aug 29, 1997 at 6:14:44 AM UTC.

```

2. The user will click on the provided URL.

3. The cPanel interface will prompt the user to set a password.
