## Overview

To contact cPanel Support, either open a support request in WHM’s [_Create Support Ticket_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/support/create-support-ticket) interface ( _WHM » Home » Support » Create Support Ticket_), or access the [cPanel Customer Portal](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us) and manually submit support requests. Additionally, you can view progress of open support requests, review closed requests, or contact cPanel Customer Service through the [cPanel Customer Portal](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us).

Note:

Contact your license vendor for support before you contact WebPros International, LLC. You can determine your license provider via the [cPanel License Verification](http://verify.cpanel.net/) website. For more information about how to identify your hosting provider, read our [How to Identify Your Hosting Provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider) documentation.

## Open a support request in WHM

You can open a support request through WHM’s [_Create Support Ticket_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/support/create-support-ticket) interface ( _WHM » Home » Support » Create Support Ticket_). This feature streamlines the ticket creation process and automates SSH authorization. It also reduces the time it takes you to open a cPanel Support ticket. In addition, it attempts to identify your support ticket requirements and redirects you to the [cPanel Customer Portal](https://tickets.cpanel.net/) as necessary.

## Manually submit a support request to cPanel

Note:

For an expanded walkthrough to open a support ticket, read our [How to Open a Technical Support Ticket](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/technical-support-services/how-to-open-a-technical-support-ticket/) documentation.

To manually submit a support request through the [cPanel Customer Portal](https://tickets.cpanel.net/), perform the following steps:

2. Select your product from the menu.
3. Read the Technical Support Agreement.
4. Enter your IP address in the appropriate text box.
5. Enter your support access ID in the appropriate text box and click _Continue_.

   - To determine your support access ID, navigate to WHM’s [_Support Center_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/support/support-center) interface ( _WHM » Home » Support » Support Center_).
6. Confirm your contact information and click _Continue_.
7. Enter the details of your request and click _Continue_.






Note:





Provide as much relevant information as possible.

8. Enter the login and access information for your server and click _Continue_.

   - If you require assistance with multiple services, click the plus ( _+_) tab and enter the access information for each additional server.
9. Submit this case as either a _Complimentary Support_ or a _Priority Support_ request.






Important:





- If you receive cPanel & WHM through a Partner or other hosting provider, you **must** contact them for support. For more information about how to find out if you receive cPanel & WHM through a third party, read our [How to Identify Your Hosting Provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) documentation.
- You **must** pay a fee for a _Priority Support_ request.

After you submit your support request, you will receive a confirmation via email.
