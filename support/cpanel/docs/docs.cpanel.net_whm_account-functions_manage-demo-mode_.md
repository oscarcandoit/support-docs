Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature allows you to convert any cPanel account on your server to a demo account.

A demo account restricts the user’s ability to alter files and folders, but the account appears to be fully functional. This makes it a useful sales tool that allows you or your resellers to show prospective clients what their accounts will look like.

Note:

Demo mode is for cPanel accounts only. WHM does not provide the ability to create demo WHM accounts.


## Enable or disable demo mode

To enable or disable demo mode for an account, perform the following steps:

1. From the _Account Selection_ list, choose the domain or username of the account that you wish to turn into a demo account.

   - You may also use the _Account Search_ feature to search for an account by domain or by user.
   - The account **must** already exist on your server. To create the demo account, use the [_Create a New Account_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/create-a-new-account/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Create a New Account_).
2. Click _Modify_.
3. Click _Enable_ or _Disable_.
