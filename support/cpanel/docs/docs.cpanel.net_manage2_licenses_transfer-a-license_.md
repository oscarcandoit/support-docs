## Transfer a license

Last modified: _2022 January 19_

## Overview

The _Transfer a license_ interface allows you to transfer an active license from the current IP address to a new IP address.

Note:

If no active licenses exist on the current IP address, you **cannot** transfer a license.


## Transfer a license

To transfer a license, perform the following steps:

1. Enter the IP address that you want to transfer the license **from** in the _Old IP_ text box.
2. Enter the IP address that you want to transfer the license **to** in the _New IP_ text box.
3. Click _Transfer IP_ to complete the transfer.






Note:




If the new IP address is currently licensed or was previously licensed, the system will **not** allow the transfer.



A confirmation interface will appear with the following information:

- A message of success.
- _[http://verify.cpanel.net](http://verify.cpanel.net/)_ — Click this link to view the license status of the new IP address.
- _Reverse the Transfer_ — Click this link to undo the transfer.






Note:




This interface displays any problems encountered if the system attempts to reverse the license transfer.



For more information about license transfers, read our [Add License](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/licenses/add-license) documentation.
