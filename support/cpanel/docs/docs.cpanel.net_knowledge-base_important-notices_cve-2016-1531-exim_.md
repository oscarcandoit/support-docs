## CVE-2016-1531 Exim

Last modified: _2020 September 28_

* * *

## Background Information

On Wednesday, March 2, 2016, Exim announced a vulnerability in all versions of the Exim software.

## Impact

According to Exim development:

> All installations having Exim `set-uid root` and using `perl_startup` are vulnerable to a local privilege escalation. Any user who can start an instance of Exim (this is normally _any_ user) can gain `root` privileges.

## Releases

The following versions of cPanel & WHM were patched to have the correct version of Exim. All previous versions of cPanel & WHM, including 11.48.x and below, are vulnerable to a `set-uid` attack on Exim.

- 11.50 — 11.50.5.0
- 11.52 — 11.52.4.0
- 11.54 — 11.54.0.18
- EDGE — 11.55.9999.106
- CURRENT — 11.54.0.18
- RELEASE — 11.54.0.18
- STABLE — 11.54.0.18

## How to determine if your server is up to date

The updated RPMs provided by cPanel will contain a changelog entry with the CVE number. You can check for this changelog entry with the following command:

```perl
rpm -q –changelog exim | grep CVE-2016-1531
```

The output should resemble below:

```perl
- Fixes CVE-2016-1531
```

## What to do if you are not up to date.

If your server is not running one of the above versions, **update immediately**.

To upgrade your server, use WHM’s [_Upgrade to Latest Version_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/cpanel/upgrade-to-latest-version/) interface ( _WHM » Home » cPanel » Upgrade to Latest Version_).

Alternatively, you can run the below commands to upgrade your server from the command line:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>/scripts/upcp<br>/scripts/check_cpanel_rpms --fix --long-list<br>``` |

Verify the new Exim RPM was installed:

```perl
rpm -q –changelog exim | grep CVE-2016-1531
```

The output should resemble below:

```perl
- Fixes CVE-2016-1531
```

## What has changed?

Exim now provides two configuration options which limit what environment variables are available to Exim and all of its child processes. The variables are `keep_environment` and `add_environment`. For the initial release with this feature, cPanel will be setting the variables as follows in all supported cPanel & WHM systems. These values can be modified in WHM’s _Advanced Configuration Editor_ interface if necessary, though we advise caution on adding too many variables to `keep_environment`.

The `/etc/exim.conf` file:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>keep_environment = X-SOURCE : X-SOURCE-ARGS : X-SOURCE-DIR<br>add_environment = PATH=/usr/local/sbin::/usr/local/bin::/sbin::/bin::/usr/sbin::/usr/bin::/sbin::/bin <br>``` |

If you are still experiencing issues or need additional help, please contact cPanel support.
