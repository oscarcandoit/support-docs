## cPanel Solo® License

Last modified: _2022 November 28_

* * *

## Overview

With a cPanel Solo® license, WHM users can manage a single cPanel account from the WHM interface. This license allows users to upgrade from shared hosting to a single-account (Solo) Cloud-based hosting solution. Its cost makes it a great entry point for many new or returning cPanel & WHM users.

Warning:

- This license limits the functionality that you would receive with a standard license.

- This license **requires** cPanel & WHM version [66.0.25](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/product-versions-and-the-release-process) or later.


## Downgrading to a cPanel Solo license

Currently, you can only downgrade to a cPanel Solo license if you are a cPanel Certified Partner with a fixed package. cPanel Solo package is not available to auto-scale during the monthly billing cycle. You must scale the cPanel Solo package manually.

## Removed interfaces

Servers that use a cPanel Solo license will **not** display the following interfaces:
