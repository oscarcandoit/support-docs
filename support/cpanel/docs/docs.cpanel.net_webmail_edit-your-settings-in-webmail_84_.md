## Overview

This section in the _Webmail_ interface has features that edit your settings.

## Configure Calendars and Contacts Client

Use this interface to get the information you need to set up your calendar and your contacts. You can use the provided information to access your calendars and contacts on a mobile device. To do this, configure your mobile mail client (for example, iOS® Mail). Connect to CalDAV for calendars, or connect to CardDAV for contacts. For more information, read our [How to Set Up Calendars and Contacts](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/webmail/how-to-set-up-calendars-and-contacts/) documentation.

## Password and Security

Note:

If you use a default Webmail account, you will not see this feature in the Webmail interface. You can access this feature in cPanel’s [_Password & Security_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/password-and-security/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Preferences » Password & Security_).

Use this interface to update your account’s password. A strong password helps you to secure your Webmail account.

### Change password

To change your password, enter the desired information and click _Save_, or use the [_Password Generator_](https://docs.cpanel.net/webmail/edit-your-settings-in-webmail/84/#password-generator%22) feature. To ensure your account’s security, make **certain** to create a strong password:

- Do **not** reuse your account passwords.
- Use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols in your password.

#### Password Generator

The _Password Generator_ feature generates secure passwords, which are hard to guess. When you click _Password Generator_, a new interface appears that contains a generated password in a text box. Click _Generate Password_ until it generates a password you like.

##### Advanced options

To set the security requirements of the new password:

1. Click _Advanced Options_.
2. Enter the desired length of the password in the _Length_ text box.
3. Select the desired alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric settings.
4. Copy the password in a safe place and select the _I have copied this password in a safe place_ checkbox.
5. Click _Use Password_ to use the generated password, or click _Cancel_ to close the _Password Generator_ interface.

### External Authentication

Note:

If you use a default Webmail account, you will not see this feature in the _Webmail_ interface. You can access this feature from your cPanel interface.

Your hosting provider may let you access Webmail with External Authentication credentials. For example, you could use cPanelID, WHMCS, Google® Accounts, Facebook®, or your hosting provider’s portal. If you do this, you don’t have to remember as many passwords.

This section of the interface lists the credentials for OpenID Connect-compliant identity providers that you can use to log in to Webmail. You can also link new credentials or unlink existing credentials.

Note:

- You can only view available External Authentication methods.
- Most identity providers let you register during this process.
- Your [cPanelID](https://id.cpanel.net/) uses the same login as the store, the ticket system, and the billing system. If you do not already use a cPanelID, you can register for one during the authentication process.
- You can link one or more external accounts to one or more Webmail accounts.
- Some identity providers use two-factor authentication (2FA). You must log in through the identity providers and use 2FA.

#### Link your account

To link your account with a provider:

1. Click _Link Account_ next to the name of the appropriate identity provider. A new login interface will appear for that identity provider.
2. Enter the requested login credentials. If you’re logged in to that provider, the [_Password & Security_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/password-and-security/) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Preferences » Password & Security_) skips this step.
3. Confirm linking your account with the provider.
4. Confirm that you wish to link your Webmail account to the provider’s authentication credentials.

#### Unlink your account

To unlink your account, click _Unlink Account_ for the appropriate account. A new interface will appear to confirm unlinking your account.

## Contact Information

Use the _Contact Information_ interface to store contact information for your Webmail account. You can also set your contact preferences.

### Edit Contact Information and Preferences

This section of the interface lets you add additional email addresses that you own to also receive notifications. You can also add your [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) ™ account’s access token to receive notifications.

Important:

cPanel & WHM does not recommend using an email address on a domain the server hosts. If you do, you may fail to receive your contact notifications. For example, if your mailbox exceeds its quota, you will not receive any new email, including notices.

### Contact Preferences

Note:

Additional settings appear in this interface for the default Webmail account. For information about these additional settings, read our [Contact Preferences](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/contact-information/) documentation.

You can select the following contact preference settings:

- _Someone logs in to my account._ — This setting notifies you when someone logs in to your account. It is useful if you suspect that someone else has your account password. To resolve this issue, change your account password to a more secure password.






Important:





- In order to use this setting, your hosting provider **must** enable [cPHulk](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/security-center/cphulk-brute-force-protection).
- The system **only** sends a single notice in each 24-hour window for a specific username, service, and IP address combination.
- The system won’t send notices if you log in successfully from a location from which you successfully logged in before. To enable these notices, select the _Send login notifications, even when the user logs in from an IP address range or netblock that contains an IP address from which a user successfully logged in previously._ checkbox.

  - _Send login notifications, even when the user logs in from an IP address range or netblock that contains an IP address from which a user successfully logged in previously._ — This setting notifies you whenever someone logs in to your account. You will receive notifications for logins from **any** IP address.
  - _My preference for successful login notifications is disabled._ — This setting notifies you if someone disabled the _Someone logs in to my account_ setting.

## Account Preferences

Use this interface to modify your Webmail account settings.

### Plus Addressing

The _Plus Addressing_ section lets you decide how the system manages messages that use [plus addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Sub-addressing). Plus addressing (or subaddressing) adds a plus character (`+`) and string after an email account username. For example, the `user@example.com` email address could use the `user+list@example.com` plus address. The email account would recognize these messages and place them in the `list` mailbox.

#### Automatically Create Folders for Plus Addressing

You can configure how the system handles plus addresses when the appropriate folder does not already exist. In this section, set the toggle to one of the following options:

- _Automatically Create Folders_ — When you receive an email that uses plus addressing and the folder does not already exist, the system will create a new folder for the message. The system will deliver the message to that new folder.
- _Do Not Automatically Create Folders_ — When you receive an email that uses plus addressing and the folder does **not** already exist, the system will **not** create a new folder. Instead, the system will deliver the message to the INBOX folder.
