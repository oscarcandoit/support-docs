## RPM Installation Failures

Last modified: _2025 February 13_

* * *

## Overview

This document provides examples of common RPM installation failures. You can use these examples to help identify and resolve issues that you may encounter when you install RPMs.

Important:

- This document **only** applies to installation failures for operating system-related RPMs on Red Hat-based servers. This document does **not** include information for RPMs that [The rpm.versions System](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/rpm-versions/) controls or for packages on servers running the [Ubuntu® operating system](https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/system-requirements-ubuntu/).

- To install operating system packages, use WHM’s [_Install Distro Packages_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/software/install-distro-packages) interface ( _WHM » Home »Software »Install Distro Packages_).

- To change how your server processes updates for these packages, use the _Operating System Package Updates_ section of WHM’s [_Update Preferences_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/server-configuration/update-preferences/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Server Configuration » Update Preferences_).

- To scan your installed cPanel-managed packages for problems, use the [`/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/check_cpanel_pkgs`](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/rpm-versions/the-check_cpanel_pkgs-script/) script. You can also use this script to reinstall cPanel & WHM packages that are [out-of-date or altered](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/rpm-versions/the-check_cpanel_pkgs-script/#script-functions).


Note:

If you continue to experience problems with the RPM installation process after you review this document, [open a support ticket](https://tickets.cpanel.net/).

## The no package available error

If the `/etc/yum.conf` file excludes a required package from updates, or a package does not exist on your server, the installation process fails.

### The no package available error Error

In this example, the absence of the `wget` package causes the installation to fail:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>``` | ```go<br>[20130131.123334]   Setting up Install Process<br>[20130131.123334]   No package wget available.<br>[20130131.123335]   Nothing to do<br>[20130131.123339] E Sysup: Needed system RPMs were not installed: wget<br>[20130131.123339] ***** FATAL: Cannot proceed.

Will send iContact the log<br>=> Log closed Thu Jan 31 12:33:39 2013<br>[20130131.123339]<br> E Running `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/updatenow --upcp<br>--log=/var/cpanel/updatelogs/update.1359657200.log` failed, exited with<br>code 4608<br>=> Log closed Thu Jan 31 12:33:39 2013<br>``` |

### Troubleshoot The no package available error

To troubleshoot this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Open the `/etc/yum.conf` file with a text editor and remove the required package from the `exclude` line. For example:




```go
exclude=bind-chroot courier* dovecot* exim* filesystem httpd* mod_ssl* mysql* perl* php* proftpd* pure-ftpd* ruby* spamassassin*
```

2. Save your changes and run the RPM installation process again.


## The package is obsoleted error

This error generally occurs due to conflicts that exist between the RPMs and a third-party repository. An RPM installation may fail if the system classifies a package as obsolete.

### The package is obsoleted error Error

In this example, the system classifies the `curl-devel` package as obsolete:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>``` | ```go<br>[20130208.081257]   Setting up Install Process<br>[20130208.081257]<br> Package curl-devel is obsoleted by libcurl-devel, trying to install<br>libcurl-devel-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2.x86_64 instead<br>[20130208.081257]   Package libcurl-devel-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2.x86_64 already installed and latest version<br>[20130208.081257]<br> Package curl-devel is obsoleted by libcurl-devel, trying to install<br>libcurl-devel-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2.x86_64 instead<br>[20130208.081257]   Package libcurl-devel-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2.x86_64 already installed and latest version<br>[20130208.081257]   Nothing to do<br>[20130208.081258] E Sysup: Needed system RPMs were not installed: curl-devel<br>[20130208.081258] ***** FATAL: Cannot proceed. Needed system RPMs were not installed.<br>[20130208.081258]   The Administrator will be notified to review this output when this script completes<br>[20130208.081258] E Detected events which require user notification during updatenow. Will send iContact the log<br>=> Log closed Fri Feb  8 08:12:58 2013<br>[20130208.081258]<br> E Running `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/updatenow --upcp<br>--log=/var/cpanel/updatelogs/update.1360329171.log` failed, exited with<br>code 18 (signal = 0)<br>``` |

### Troubleshoot The package is obsoleted error

To troubleshoot this error, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `rpm -qa|grep curl` command to determine which third-party `curl` RPMs exist on your system. The output will resemble the following example:






|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>``` | ```go<br>compat-libcurl3-7.15.5-2.el5.remi<br>curl-7.15.5-15.el5<br>curl-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2<br>libcurl-devel-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2<br>libcurl-7.21.7-5.el5.remi.2<br>``` |

2. Run the `ls /etc/yum.repos.d` command to confirm whether your server uses a third-party repository. The output will resemble the following example:






|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>``` | ```go<br>./ CentOS-Debuginfo.repo epel.repo remi.repo.save<br>../ CentOS-Media.repo epel-testing.repo<br>CentOS-Base.repo CentOS-Vault.repo remi.repo<br>``` |

3. Disable the third-party repository that caused the error. To do this, run the following command:




```go
yum-config-manager --disable repositoryname
```





Note:





In this example, `repositoryname` represents the third-party repository to disable.

4. Run the RPM installation process again.


## RPM conflicts

RPMs in the system’s update log that do **not** match similar RPMs in the repository are commonly known as “rogue RPMs,” and cause the installation process to fail.

### RPM conflicts Error

In this example, the `MySQL` RPM causes the installation process to fail:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>``` | ```go<br>[20130128.230346] Testing RPM transaction<br>[20130128.230348] error: Failed dependencies:<br>[20130128.230348] MySQL conflicts with *mysql-5.0.77-4.el5_4.2.i386*<br>[20130128.230348] W Exit Code: 254<br>[20130128.230348] ***** FATAL: Test install failed: error: Failed dependencies:<br>[20130128.230348] MySQL conflicts with mysql-5.0.77-4.el5_4.2.i386<br>[20130128.230348] The Administrator will be notified to review this output when this script completes<br>[20130128.230348] E Error testing if the RPMs will install: Died at /usr/local/cpanel/scripts/updatenow.static line 12517.<br>[20130128.230348] E Detected events which require user notification during updatenow. Will send iContact the log<br>``` |

### Troubleshoot RPM conflicts

To troubleshoot this error, perform the following steps

1. Run the `rpm -qa|grep -i ^mysql` command to locate the version of the MySQL RPM in the update log. The output will resemble the following example:




```go
mysql-5.0.77-4.el5_4.2
```

2. Run the previous command on another server and compare the output to the output of the first server. For example:




```go
MySQL-server-5.5.28-2.cp.1148
```





Note:





The difference in RPM versions indicates that the `mysql-5.0.77-4.el5_4.2` RPM is a rogue RPM, which is why it conflicts with the MySQL installation.

3. Remove the “rogue” RPM file. For example:




```go
rpm -e --nodeps mysql-5.0.77-4.el5_4.2
```

4. Run the RPM installation process again.


## RPM package file conflicts

An RPM installation can fail if there are package file conflicts. This can occur when a previous RPM file isn’t removed from the system. You must remove any conflicting files before you can successfully install an RPM.

### RPM package file conflicts Error

In this example, the `clamav-0.100.3-1.el6.x86_64` file conflicts with the RPM package file:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>``` | ```go<br>[2019-05-30 16:02:13 +0500]   All files Staged<br>[2019-05-30 16:02:13 +0500]   Testing if the newly downloaded RPMS can be installed without conflict<br>[2019-05-30 16:02:13 +0500]   Testing RPM transaction<br>[2019-05-30 16:02:14 +0500]     file /etc/rc.d/init.d/clamd from install of cpanel-clamav-0.101.2-1.cp1180.x86_64 conflicts with file from package clamd-0.100.3-1.el6.x86_64<br>[2019-05-30 16:02:14 +0500] W Exit Code: 73<br>[2019-05-30 16:02:14 +0500] ***** FATAL: Test install failed:   file /etc/rc.d/init.d/clamd from install of cpanel-clamav-0.101.2-1.cp1180.x86_64 conflicts with file from package clamd-0.100.3-1.el6.x86_64<br>``` |

### Troubleshoot RPM package file conflicts

To troubleshoot this error, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `rpm -qa | grep -i clamav` command to locate the version of the ClamAV RPM in the update log. The output will resemble the following example:






|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>``` | ```go<br>cpanel-perl-528-File-Scan-ClamAV-1.95-1.cp1178.noarch<br>cpanel-clamav-virusdefs-0.100.2-1.cp1170.x86_64<br>cpanel-clamav-0.100.2-1.cp1170.x86_64<br>``` |

2. Run the `rpm -qa | grep -i clamav` command on another server. Compare the output to the output of the first server. For example:






|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>``` | ```go<br>clamav-0.100.3-1.el6.x86_64<br>cpanel-clamav-virusdefs-0.100.2-1.cp1170.x86_64<br>cpanel-perl-528-File-Scan-ClamAV-1.95-1.cp1178.noarch<br>clamav-db-0.100.3-1.el6.x86_64<br>cpanel-clamav-0.100.2-1.cp1170.x86_64<br>``` |

3. Remove the conflicting RPM file. For example:




```go
rpm -e --nodeps clamav-0.100.3-1.el6.x86_64
```

4. Run the RPM installation process again.


## Failure to unpack a new package

An RPM installation fails if the update process cannot unpack the new package to the correct location. Binaries that you cannot modify (immutable binaries) cause this error.

### Failure to unpack a new package Error

In this example, both the `tar` and `unzip` packages cause the installation process to fail:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>``` | ```go<br>[20130210.141900]   Running Transaction<br>[20130210.141903]<br>[20130210.141903]   Installing     : gzip                                                     1/3<br>[20130210.141903]<br>[20130210.141903]<br> Installing     :<br>unzip                                                    2/3Error<br>unpacking rpm package unzip-5.52-3.el5.i386<br>[20130210.141903]<br>[20130210.141903]   error: unpacking of archive failed on file /usr/bin/unzip: cpio: rename<br>[20130210.141903]<br>[20130210.141903]<br> Installing     :<br>tar                                                      3/3Error<br>unpacking rpm package 2:tar-1.15.1-32.el5_8.i386<br>[20130210.141903]<br>[20130210.141903]   error: unpacking of archive failed on file /bin/tar: cpio: rename<br>[20130210.141904]<br>[20130210.141904]   Installed:<br>[20130210.141904]     gzip.i386 0:1.3.5-13.el5.centos<br>[20130210.141904]<br>[20130210.141904]   Failed:<br>[20130210.141904]     tar.i386 2:1.15.1-32.el5_8               unzip.i386 0:5.52-3.el5<br>[20130210.141904]<br>[20130210.141904]   Complete!<br>[20130210.141910]<br> E Sysup: Needed system RPMs were not installed: tar, unzip, wget<br>[20130210.141910] ***** FATAL: Cannot proceed.

### Troubleshoot Failure to unpack a new package

To troubleshoot this error, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `lsattr /usr/bin/unzip` command to determine whether immutable binaries caused this error. The following example indicates that the system contains immutable binaries:






|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>----i-------- /usr/bin/unzip<br>----i-------- /bin/tar<br>``` |

2. Remove the immutable flags. To do this, run the following commands:






|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>chattr -i /usr/bin/unzip<br>chattr -i /bin/tar<br>``` |

3. Run the RPM installation process again.


## The Your RPM database appears unstable error

An RPM installation fails if the destination directory is immutable or full.

### The Your RPM database appears unstable error Error

In this example, any attempt to install an RPM causes the installation process to fail.
