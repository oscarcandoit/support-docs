## Submit a New Priority Support Request

Last modified: _2022 July 27_

* * *

## Overview

The _Submit a New Priority Support Request_ link automatically forwards you to the cPanel [Customer Portal interface](http://tickets.cpanel.net/), where you can open a priority support request.

Note:

- If the request is not related to a specific server, you can use any currently licensed IP address.
- If you did not link your _Manage2_ account with the ticket system, you **must** do so before you submit priority tickets.

For more information about how to open a ticket and to link your _Manage2_ account, read our [How to Open a Technical Support Ticket](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/technical-support-services/how-to-open-a-technical-support-ticket) documentation.
