Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This feature allows you to reset the password for your server’s Mailman mailing list software and mailing lists. You do **not** need the old password to set a new password, which can be useful if you cannot remember the old password or if hackers compromised it.

## How to reset a Mailman Password

To reset a Mailman password, perform the following steps:

1. In the _Mailman Account Lists_ menu, select the mailing list whose password you wish to change.



Note:




The _mailman_ mailing list is only for internal use by the Mailman application. If you have problems with mailing lists on your server, reset this password.


2. Enter and confirm the new password in the appropriate text boxes.







Note:





- The system evaluates the password that you enter on a scale of 100 points. `0` indicates a weak password, while `100` indicates a very secure password.

- Some web hosts require a minimum password strength. A green password _Strength_ meter indicates that the password is equal to or greater than the required password strength.

- Click _Password Generator_ to generate a strong password. For more information, read our [Password & Security](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/password-and-security/) documentation.


3. Click _Change Password_.
