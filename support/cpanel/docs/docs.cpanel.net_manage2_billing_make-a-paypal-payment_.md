## Make a PayPal Payment

Last modified: _2019 June 26_

* * *

## Overview

The _Make a Paypal Payment_ interface allows you to pay your account balance with a PayPal® eCheck payment.

Warning:

- PayPal does **not** automatically post payments to your account unless you pay through the Manage2 interface.
- If you use a PayPal eCheck for payment, PayPal does **not** post the payment to your account until **after** the eCheck clears. If this occurs **after** the due date, your account **may** become past due.

## Post a payment

To post a new payment, enter the amount that you wish to pay in the _Payment Amount_ text box and click _Submit_.

Note:

Manage2 automatically enters your account balance in the _Payment Amount_ text box. It also displays your current account balance above this text box.
