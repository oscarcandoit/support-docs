## CVE-2016-9963 Exim

Last modified: _2020 September 28_

* * *

## Background Information

On Sunday, December 25, 2016, Exim announced a vulnerability in versions 4.69 to 4.87 of the Exim software.

## Impact

According to Exim development:

> “If several conditions are met, Exim leaks private information to a remote attacker.”

Depending on configuration options for Exim, a domain’s DKIM signing keys can be leaked to Exim log files. Additionally, if the `EXPERIMENTAL_DSN_INFO=yes` build flag is used, DKIM signing keys can be leaked to a remote attacker.

Exim log files are normally not readable by unprivileged users on cPanel & WHM systems. Additionally, cPanel & WHM does **not** provide an Exim installation with the `EXPERIMENTAL_DSN_INFO=yes` build flag and does not leak DKIM signing keys to remote attackers based on currently available information. As such, the most severe impacts of CVE-2016-9963 do not apply to cPanel & WHM systems.

## Releases

The following versions of cPanel & WHM were patched to have the correct version of Exim.

- 62 — 62.0.1

- 60 — 60.0.31

- 58 — 58.0.41

- 56 — 56.0.41

- 54 — 54.0.34

- EDGE — 62.0.1

- CURRENT — 62.0.1

- RELEASE — 60.0.31

- STABLE — 60.0.31


## How to determine if your server is up to date

The updated RPMs provided by cPanel will contain a changelog entry with the CVE number. You can check for this changelog entry with the following command:

```perl
rpm -q –changelog exim | grep CVE-2016-9963
```

The output should resemble below:

```perl
- Patch for CVE-2016-9963
```

## What to do if you are not up to date

If your server is **not** running one of the above versions, update immediately.

To upgrade your server, use WHM’s [_Upgrade to Latest Version_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/cpanel/upgrade-to-latest-version/) interface ( _WHM » Home » cPanel » Upgrade to Latest Version_).

Alternatively, you can run the below commands to upgrade your server from the command line:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>/scripts/upcp<br>/scripts/check_cpanel_rpms --fix --long-list<br>``` |

Verify the new Exim RPM was installed:

```perl
rpm -q –changelog exim | grep CVE-2016-9963
```

The output should resemble below:

```perl
- Patch for CVE-2016-9963
```
