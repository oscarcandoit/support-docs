## CVE 2019 7524 Buffer overflow when reading extension header from Dovecot index files

Last modified: _2022 December 2_

* * *

## Background Information

We were made aware of a CVE in Dovecot Versions 2.0.14 - 2.3.5 that involves using Solr on Thursday, March 28th 2019.

## Releases

- 70 — 70.0.68
- 76 — EOL
- 78 — 78.0.20
- CURRENT — 78.0.20
- RELEASE — 78.0.20
- STABLE — 78.0.20

## Impact

According to the vendor, the risk involves a local `root` privilege escalation or executing arbitrary code in Dovecot process context.

The following lines in `dovecot.conf` are affected:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```go<br>dovecot.conf: mail_plugins = quota quota_clone zlib fts fts_solr<br>dovecot.conf: mail_plugins = $mail_plugins zlib imap_zlib quota_clone virtual  fts fts_solr<br>``` |

## How to determine if your server is up to date

The updated RPMs provided by cPanel will contain a changelog entry with the CVE number. You can check for this changelog entry with the following command:

```perl
rpm -q --changelog dovecot | grep CVE-2019-7524
```

This should give you output resembling the following:

```perl
- Patch for CVE-2019-7524
```

## Mitigation

Dovecot Solr is an opt-in option that can be installed from the Mange Plugins interface of WHM.

If you have previously installed this plugin, we recommend uninstalling it from your cPanel & WHM until we have released patched versions.

To uninstall, navigate to WHM’s [_Manage Plugins_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/cpanel/manage-plugins) interface ( _WHM » Home » cPanel » Manage Plugins_) and uninstall Solr.

This requires ability to<br>directly modify dovecot indexes.<br>Steps to reproduce:<br>Produce dovecot.index.log entry that creates an FTS header which has<br>more than 12 bytes of data.<br>Trigger dovecot indexer-worker or run doveadm index.<br>Dovecot will crash.<br>Mitigations:<br>Since 2.3.0 dovecot has been compiled with stack smash protection, ASLR,<br>read-only GOT tables and other techniques that make exploiting this bug<br>much harder.<br>Solution:<br>Operators should update to the latest Patch Release. The only workaround<br>is to disable FTS and pop3-uidl plugin.<br>``` |
