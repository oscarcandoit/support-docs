Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface displays a table of all of the active processes on your server.

## Show Current Running Processes

The table displays the process information in the following five columns:

- _Pid_ — The process’ ID number. In a \*-nix system, the system assigns a unique identification number to each process.
- _Name_ — The name of the process or daemon.
- _File_ — The full path to the file that started the daemon or process.
- _Current Directory_ — Specifies the directory in which the process runs. Typically, this is the root (/) directory.
- _Command Line_ — Specifies the command or directory that started the process.
