Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface for resellers in WHM's [_Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/resellers/edit-reseller-nameservers-and-privileges) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Resellers >> Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges_).

## Overview

This interface allows you to change an account’s package. You may wish to do this, for example, when a site’s popularity changes and the account’s owner wishes to change their hosting plan.

Note:

Changes that you make in this interface do **not** change the account’s IP address. To modify the IP address for an account, use WHM’s [_Change Site’s IP Address_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/account-functions/change-site-ip-address/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Account Functions » Change Site’s IP Address_).

## Change package

To change an account’s package, perform the following steps:

1. Select the desired account and click _Modify_.
2. Select the new package from the menu.





Note:




Click the magnifying glass icon (![view icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/upgradedowngradeanaccountglass.jpg)) to view the configuration of any package in the list.


3. Click _Upgrade/Downgrade_.
