## Overview

This interface allows you to search the licenses in your account. By default, the search results include both active and expired licenses.

## Search for a license

To search your licenses, perform the following steps:

1. Select one of the following search types:

- _Email_ — The email address that the server administrator entered in WHM’s [_Basic WebHost Manager Setup_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/server-configuration/basic-webhost-manager-setup/) interface ( _WHM » Home » Server Configuration » Basic WebHost Manager Setup_).
- _Ipregrex (slow)_ — A regular expression that represents a portion of the IP address.
- _Ip (default)_ — The license’s IP address.
- _Hostname_ — The license’s hostname.
- _Hostnamepartial (slow)_ — A regular expression that represents a portion of the license’s hostname.

2. Select whether you wish to search for active or expired licenses.
3. Enter any search criteria in the _Search_ String text box.
4. Click _Find_.

To clear the search criteria, click _Reset_.

## License History

The _License History_ section groups your search results by IP address and displays the number of licenses in each group.

Note:

If you previously licensed an IP address, the interface may list multiple entries for a single IP address. For example, if you renewed a license for an IP address several times, the interface will list an entry for each renewal.


You can perform the following actions for each license in the _License History_ section:

- Click _Expire_ to expire an active license.
- Click _View/Modify_ to view or modify license information.
- Click a license’s IP address to view the license-related event log for that IP address.

To modify a license’s group, click _Edit this group/Reset Group Password_ at the bottom of a group of search results.
