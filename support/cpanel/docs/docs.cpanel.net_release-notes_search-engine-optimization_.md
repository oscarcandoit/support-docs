## Search Engine Optimization 1.0.1

_February 3, 2025_

We added the [_Search Engine Optimization_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Search Engine Optimization_) to cPanel & WHM. Users can now easily audit their websites to see how well they can be indexed by search engines like Google® and DuckDuckGo, helping users ensure their websites show up where they should in relevant searches.
