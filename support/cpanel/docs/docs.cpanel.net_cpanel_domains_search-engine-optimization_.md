## Search Engine Optimization

Last modified: _2025 August 21_

* * *

Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

Note:

WebPros International, LLC currently provides this feature in a limited release, with plans to expand its availability in future updates.

## Overview

The _Search Engine Optimization_ interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Search Engine Optimization_), also accessible from the [Main Menu](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/#the-main-menu), allows you to audit your websites for search engine optimization. Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to the practice of organizing website structure and content to make it easy for search engines like Google® to identify the site’s purpose. This helps search engines deliver your website content to users who search for terms related to the site’s purpose - for example, `affordable microscope store`.

Important:

- You **must** have a website with a valid IP address that you can manage. For more information about how to create a website with cPanel & WHM, read our [Create a Website](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/create-a-website/) documentation.
- You cannot use Search Engine Optimization with a temporary domain. If you have a temporary domain and want to use Search Engine Optimization, contact your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) to replace the temporary domain with a registered domain.

## Run your first audit

To use the _Search Engine Optimization_ interface ( _cPanel » Home » Domains » Search Engine Optimization_), you must run at least one audit. To do so, select the first domain whose SEO you want to audit in the _Boost your website’s SEO_ menu, then click _Get Report_:

![SEO sign-up menu](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/xovi-signup.png)

A Quick SEO Audit will begin, and your [domain’s audit report](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#the-domain-audit-report) will open.

### Register for the Full SEO Audit

You can register for the Full SEO Audit by completing the unlimited audit sign-up process.

When you click _Sign up for free_ in the _Unlock unlimited audits_ menu in your [domain audit report](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#the-domain-audit-report), the _Sign up_ text box will appear. Enter your email and click _Continue_ to start the sign-up process to receive [unlimited Full SEO Audits](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#seo-audit-types).

You will receive a sign-up email with a security code, and the _Verify your email_ section will appear. Enter your security code in the _Security code_ text box and click _Finish sign up_ to finish signing up and unlock unlimited audits.

You will return to your [domain’s audit report](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#the-domain-audit-report).

### SEO audit types

The following audit types are available with Search Engine Optimization:

| Audit type | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| Quick SEO Audit | - One audit per week<br>- A [crawl](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#crawl) of 10 URLs<br>- A list of [high-priority](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#issue-priorities) issues that could **critically affect** your website’s place in search results |
| Full SEO Audit | - Unlimited audits<br>- A [crawl](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-glossary/#crawl) of all URLs<br>- A list of [high-priority](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#issue-priorities) issues that could **critically affect** your website’s place in search results<br>- A list of [lower-priority](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#issue-priorities) issues that could add up to critically affect your website’s place in search results |

#### Issue priorities

The Search Engine Optimization tool ranks SEO issues with a priority level to make it clear which issues pose the most risk to your websites’ search engine rankings. The priority levels are as follows:

| Priority level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Low | This issue could have minor impacts on your website’s search engine ranking. <br>Important:<br>Although low-priority issues do not individually affect search engine rankings as much as higher-priority issues, multiple low-priority issues can add up to have a significant negative impact on search engine rankings. |
| Medium | This issue could decrease your search engine ranking. |
| High | This issue will **seriously** decrease your search engine ranking. |

## The domain audit report

The domain audit report contains the following items:

- [_Add website_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#the-add-a-website-menu) — Click this to open the _Add a website_ menu.
- [_Account Settings_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#account-settings) — Click this to open the _Account Settings_ section.
- The [_All issues_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#all-issues) tab — This tab contains a summary of all the SEO issues your audit identified.
- The [_Page-based issue list_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#page-based-issue-list) tab — This tab contains a list of the SEO issues your audit identified that belong to a specific webpage.
- A screenshot from your domain
- Your website’s audit score
- The _Your SEO Audit report is ready_ section. — This section includes the domain audited, the audit type and date, and the _Run Quick Audit_ and _Run Full Audit_ buttons. Click one of these options to rerun an audit at any time, even if you have not signed up for unlimited audits.

Note:

If you have **not** signed up for unlimited audits, the domain audit report also contains an additional sign-up menu, the _Unlock unlimited audits_ menu. Click _Sign up for free_ to begin [the unlimited audit sign-up process](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#register-for-the-full-seo-audit).

### All issues

The _All issues_ tab of your [domain audit report](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#the-domain-audit-report) contains your overall SEO audit report with a summary of the _Found issues_ list. You can sort the issues in this list with the following buttons, where `All` is the default selection:

![A four-menu button detailing how to sort SEO issues (all, issues, recommendations, passed checks) with checkboxes below to filter High, Medium, or Low priority items](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/xovi-menu-buttons.png)

You also can select the _High priority_, _Medium priority_, or _Low priority_ checkboxes to filter the SEO audit results that you see.

Note:

The filter checkboxes are **only** available when you run a full audit.

#### Resolve issues

You can click the _Expand_ icon (![open report icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/expandarrow.png)) next to any item in the report to open its specific recommendations for how to resolve the issue. Some recommendations are general, while some are specific to your domain.

The recommendation report contains two tabs, which provide an explanation for each issue and a recommendation about how to fix it, as in the following example:

![a recommendation report that tells a user to set up a Google Business Profile listing for their domain, containing links to other tutorials](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/xovi-recommendation-example.png).

- The _How to fix_ tab — This tab provides a brief explanation of the issue and a recommendation to fix it.
- The _Help and information_ tab — This tab provides extended information. The _Learn More_ links contain more information about the recommendation, including tutorials about how to implement the suggested change.

### Page-based issue list

The page-based issue list contains a list of SEO checks sorted by the page on your website they affect. It also includes a 2D Rank, which assigns a score from `1` to `100` to the page, based on its importance to your site.

The _Pages_ section **only** displays issues that exist on the specific pages listed. It does **not** list issues that apply to your website as a whole.

## All websites

The _All websites_ section contains the current websites table and the _Add a website_ menu.

### The Add a website menu

To add a website to the [current websites table](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#the-current-websites-table), select it in the _Add a website_ menu, then click _Add website_. The website will appear in the current websites table.

| _Audit Result_ | Whether the audit successfully completed, as follows: <br>- `Audit Failed` — The audit could not be completed.<br>- `Full SEO Audit` — A [Full SEO Audit](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#seo-audit-types) successfully completed.<br>- `Quick SEO Audit` — A [Quick SEO Audit](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/#seo-audit-types) successfully completed.<br>- `Canceled` — The audit was canceled before it could complete. |
| _Audit Date_ | The day the audit was attempted. |
