* * *

Looking for this interface?

Note:

Your [hosting provider](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/how-to-identify-your-hosting-provider/) can enable or disable this interface in WHM's [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface ( _WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## Overview

The cPanel interface is the main page for the cPanel account user. You can use the cPanel interface to create and manage your domains, email accounts, website content, SQL databases, and many other web-based services.

## Log in to cPanel

To get started, log in to your cPanel account. To access cPanel, enter your server’s IP address or your domain name and the `2083` port in your preferred browser. For example:

| Browser URL example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `https://198.51.100.1:2083` | Access cPanel over an encrypted connection with your IP address. |
| `https://example.com:2083` | Access cPanel over an encrypted connection with your domain name. |

To log in with your cPanel account, perform the following steps:

1. Enter your cPanel username in the _Username_ text box.
2. Enter your password in the _Password_ text box.
3. Click _Log in_. The [cPanel _Tools_ interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface) will appear.

When you log in to cPanel for the first time, the interface will display the [_Onboarding Assistant_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/onboarding-assistant/) feature. The _Onboarding Assistant_ feature provides a starting point for using the [cPanel interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/).

## Create a website

The cPanel interface contains many native tools to help you create a website for your domain. If you want to create a website but do not have any existing content to upload, you can create a website using one of cPanel’s features.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [_Sitejet Builder_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/sitejet-builder) | The _Sitejet Builder_ interface is fully integrated with the Sitejet Website Builder (Content Management System) website. You can use the Sitejet Website Builder (CMS) to create and design a website for your domain. Then, you can publish it with your cPanel account. |
| [_WordPress Management_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/wp-toolkit-for-cpanel/) | The _WP Toolkit_ interface allows you to easily manage your account’s WordPress® installations. |
| [_Site Publisher_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/site-publisher) | This _Site Publisher_ interface allows you to quickly create a simple website, even if you have never created a website before. |

Note:

For additional information about the features listed above, read our [Create a Website](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/accounts/create-a-website/) documentation.

You can use cPanel’s [_File Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/file-manager) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Files » File Manager_) to upload, edit, and delete your files on the server.

## Create an email account

You can create, manage, and delete email accounts with cPanel’s [_Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-accounts) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_).
