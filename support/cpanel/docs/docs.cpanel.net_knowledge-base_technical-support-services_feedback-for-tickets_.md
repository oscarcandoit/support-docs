## Feedback for Tickets

Last modified: _2025 June 9_

* * *

## Overview

The _My requests_ interface allows you to provide feedback and suggestions for your resolved tickets.

Note:

- The email notification that you receive for each closed ticket includes a direct link to provide feedback for that ticket. If you followed that link, proceed to [Select your feedback rating](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/technical-support-services/feedback-for-tickets/#select-your-feedback-rating).
- In some regions, you may receive help from a Linux Support Engineer instead of a Technical Support Analyst. The steps to provide feedback and suggestions are the same.

Warning

You may **only** provide feedback for five days after we mark a ticket as _Solved_.


## Navigate to your list of tickets from the cPanel Support Center

![user menu in the cPanel Support Center](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/customer-portal-activities.png)

To access your list of tickets from the _cPanel Support Center_, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [cPanel Support Center](https://support.cpanel.net/).
2. In the user menu, click _My activities_. The _My requests_ interface will appear.

## Select the desired ticket

![My requests table](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/my-requests.png)

To select the desired ticket to provide with feedback, perform the following steps:

1. On the _My requests_ tab, select the desired ticket in the _Subject_ column.
2. Click the subject of the desired ticket. The ticket information will open in a new interface.
3. At the bottom of your ticket, the _How would you rate the support you received?_ section will appear.

## Select your feedback rating

![the How would you rate the support you received? section in a support ticket interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/how-would-you-rate-the-support.png)

The _How would you rate the support you received?_ section allows you to provide feedback about the **last** Technical Support Analyst to respond to your ticket.

Click _Good, I’m satisfied_ to report a positive experience with the last Technical Support Analyst to respond to your ticket. Click _Bad, I’m unsatisfied_ to report a negative experience with the last Technical Support Analyst to respond to your ticket.

Important:

The feedback window will close five days after cPanel Support marks the ticket as _Solved_. After this time, you cannot provide a feedback rating on the ticket.

## Provide additional feedback

Once you have selected your feedback rating, the following sections will appear in the ticket interface depending on your feedback rating:

### What is the main reason you are unsatisfied?

If you selected the _Bad, I’m unsatisfied_ option in the _How would you rate the support you received?_ section, the _What is the main reason you are unsatisfied?_ menu will appear. Select the reason that is **most** relevant to your ticket.

### Add a comment about the quality of support you received (optional)

Once you have rated the ticket, the _Add a comment about the quality of support you received (optional)_ text box will appear. Enter feedback about **any** Technical Support Analyst who interacted with your ticket or your recommendations for improvements to WebPros International, LLC’s processes and procedures here.

## Submit your feedback

To send your feedback to WebPros International, LLC, click _Submit my rating_.

### Revise submitted feedback

After you submit your initial feedback for a ticket, you can revise your rating selection. To do so, navigate to the ticket’s interface and click _Change my rating_.

This feedback will supersede your original ratings.

To revise your feedback, perform the steps in this tutorial again for that ticket.
