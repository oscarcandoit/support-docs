## Overview

The cPanel interface is the hub of your cPanel user account and provides you with access to important information and updates. The _Tools_ page is the default home page.

![cPanel Tools interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/jupiter-tools-page-118.png)

The cPanel interface consists of the following sections:

1. [Navigation bar](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#navigation-bar)
2. [The Main Menu](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#the-main-menu)
3. [The Tools Page](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#the-tools-page)
4. [Features](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#features)
5. [General Information](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#general-information)
6. [Statistics](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#statistics)

Note:

- Your hosting provider’s server profile may **disable** certain features in the cPanel interface. For more information, read our [How to Use Server Profiles](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/how-to-use-server-profiles) documentation.
- If your server administrator has enabled [cPanel Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics) at the server level, a graph icon (![Graph icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/cpanel-analytics-graph-icon.png)) will appear on the right side of the interface.

  - Click the icon to display your account-level cPanel Analytics settings. Select whether _This account is for an individual_ or _This account is for a business._ Then, select the _By checking this box, you agree that we may collect your usage statistics._ checkbox and click _Save_ to enable cPanel Analytics for your account.
  - WebPros International, LLC values your privacy. For more information about how we collect and use cPanel Analytics data, read our [cPanel Analytics](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics) documentation.

## Onboarding Assistant

The _Onboarding Assistant_ **only** appears for new cPanel account users and provides a starting point for using the [cPanel interface](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/118/#overview).

For more information, read our [_Onboarding Assistant_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/onboarding-assistant) documentation.

## Navigation bar

Every interface in cPanel displays the navigation bar. The navigation bar provides the currently-active account information, the search bar, and controls that allow you to change settings and log out of your account.

- Use the _Search_ text box to quickly find the interfaces that you need.






Note:





Use the forward slash (`/`) keyboard shortcut to quickly access the _Search Features_ text box.

- To open the cPanel account menu, click the cPanel account icon (![User icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/jupiter-user-icon.png)). Here you can manage your account preferences, change your password, change language, update your contact information, give feedback, or log out.

  - To reset the cPanel interface, click your username and then click _Reset Page Settings_ in the user menu.
- If your _Notifications_ icon has a red dot on the bell (![Bell icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/jupiter-notification-icon.png)), you have a message, warning, and/or error on your cPanel account. Click the _Notifications_ icon to display them. Server owners can also customize this interface to broadcast important information to their customers.

## The Main Menu

The Main Menu allows you to navigate to the _Tools_ page from any interface. You can also access the [_Sitejet Builder_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/sitejet-builder/), [_Social Media Management_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/social-media-management/), [_WordPress Management_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/wp-toolkit-for-cpanel/), [_Manage Team_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/preferences/manage-team/), [_Search Engine Optimization_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/domains/search-engine-optimization/), and [_Site Quality Monitoring_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) features. Every interface in cPanel displays the Main Menu. To return to your default cPanel home page at any time, click the cPanel logo.

Note:

If you do **not** see one of these features in your Main Menu when you should, contact your hosting provider.


## The Tools page

### Features

The cPanel interface lists of all of your account’s available features in groups for different types of functionality. You can click and drag the feature groups to customize their order.

### General Information

The _General Information_ section displays the following information about your cPanel account:

#### Current User

The name of the current cPanel account. If you are a reseller or a `root` user, you can switch between cPanel accounts.

#### Primary Domain

The current account’s primary or main domain name. Click the _SSL/TLS status_ button to navigate to cPanel’s [_SSL/TLS Status_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/ssl-tls-status) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Security » SSL/TLS Status_). A warning (![Warning icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/jupiter-warning-icon.png)) icon appears if a problem exists with the status of the certificate. This section also displays the type of certificate that secures the primary domain:

- _DV Certificate_ — A domain-validated certificate.
- _EV Certificate_ — An extended-validation certificate.
- _OV Certificate_ — An organization-validated certificate.
- _Self-signed Certificate_ — A self-signed certificate.
- _No Valid Certificate_ — A valid certificate exists, but it does **not** currently secure the domain. For example, an expired or revoked certificate.

#### Shared IP Address or Dedicated IP Address

The current account’s shared or dedicated IP address.

- A shared IP address means that multiple websites within one server use a single IP address.
- A dedicated IP address means that the website possesses its own IP address.

#### Home Directory

The absolute path to the account’s `/home` directory on the server.

#### Last Login IP Address

The IP address of the user that most recently logged in to the account.

Note:

This IP address is **not** the currently-authenticated IP address. For example, if you log in via the `10.1.1.1` IP address, and then log in multiple times via the `10.2.2.2` IP address, the interface will display `10.1.1.1` as the _Last Login IP address_ value. It will **not** display `10.2.2.2` as the _Last Login IP address_ value until you log in through a different IP address.

#### Site Quality Monitoring banner

Important:

This banner will **not** appear if you have already set up [Site Quality Monitoring](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/) or if your hosting provider has disabled Site Quality Monitoring.

If you have not already signed up for [Site Quality Monitoring](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/metrics/site-quality-monitoring/), the following banner may appear in the _General Information_ section of the Main Menu:

![Site Quality Monitoring banner](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/sqm-main-menu-banner.png)

To begin monitoring, you may click _Start Monitoring_ to open the _Site Quality Monitoring_ interface and begin the sign-up process ( _cPanel » Home » Metrics » Site Quality Monitoring_). Site Quality Monitoring allows you to monitor websites for common issues, such as low SEO ranking and performance problems.

To dismiss this banner **permanently**, click the _X_ icon (![X icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/sqm-x-icon.png)).

#### User Analytics ID

The _User Analytics ID_ is the Universally Unique Identifier ( [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))
automatically generated for your cPanel account. For more information, read our [_cPanel Analytics_](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/cpanel-product/cpanel-analytics/) documentation.

#### Theme

The current cPanel theme. If your account includes more than one theme, you can use the menu to search for and switch between cPanel themes.

#### NGINX Caching

The status of [NGINX®](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/nginx/nginx-with-reverse-proxy/#caching) caching for the account. This section displays either _Active_ or _Inactive_, depending on the NGINX caching status.

If your hosting provider allows you to manage whether NGINX uses caching or not, you can set the toggle to either _Active_ or _Inactive_. If NGINX caching is active for your account, you can also click _Clear Cache_ to clear the NGINX cache.

This category **only** appears if your hosting provider installed NGINX.

#### Server Information

Click this link to navigate to cPanel’s [_Server Information_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/server-information-for-cpanel) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Server Information_), which displays additional information about the account and its server.

### Statistics

The _Statistics_ section displays important usage statistics for your cPanel account. This section displays information about your cPanel account’s resource usage.

#### Symbols and Buttons

Each statistic may display one of the following:

| Symbol or Button | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A warning (![Warning icon](https://docs.cpanel.net/img/jupiter-warning-icon.png)) icon | This icon indicates one of the following: Your server cannot retrieve information about the item’s usage or quota.<br>Your account uses 80% or more of an item’s quota. |
| An infinity symbol (`∞`) | This icon indicates an unlimited quota. Otherwise, the interface displays your account’s quota limits. |
| An _Upgrade_ button | Click this button to increase the quota for this statistic in your hosting plan. The _Upgrade_ button **only** appears if your hosting provider has added [integration links](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/guides/guide-to-integration-links/) to your server. |
| A _Manage button_ | Click the _Manage_ button to access the relevant cPanel interface where you can reduce your quota usage. For example, if your _Email Accounts_ statistic is high, you can delete unused email accounts in cPanel’s [_Email Accounts_](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/email/email-accounts) interface ( _cPanel » Home » Email » Email Accounts_). |
| An exclamation mark (`!`) icon | Hover your cursor over this symbol to read more information about the error. This symbol appears if your server cannot retrieve more information about the usage or quota limit for your server. |
