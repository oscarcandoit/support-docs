## Overview

The _Review Pending Transfers_ interface allows you to view and cancel any pending license transfers.

- _Source Company Notes_ — The time stamp when the company added the IP address and when the license comes up for renewal/billing.
- _Responses_ — Messages regarding the transfer and 48 hour review period which allows time to contact Customer Service about any issues with the transfer.

  - _Waiting Response (Time Left=`nn`)_ — Waiting for approval or denial of the transfer. (`nn` = hours left out of 48 hours)
  - _Approve (No Response in 48 Hours)_ — Automatically approved transfer after waiting 48 hours.
