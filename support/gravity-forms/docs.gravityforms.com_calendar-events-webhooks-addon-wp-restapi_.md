## Introduction

The Gravity Forms Webhooks Add-On can be used to send requests to the WordPress REST API endpoint added by the Events Calendar plugin, either locally or on another site, to create new events when a form is submitted.

**Note:** This article assumes you have [installed and activated](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms-add-ons/) the Webhooks Add-On and the [Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar/) plugin. If not, you will need to do so before any of the functionality in this article can be used.

## Configuring the Form

Create a new form and add the following fields.

| Type | Label | **Other Settings** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Single Line Text** | Event Title |  |
| **Paragraph** | Event Description |  |
| **Checkboxes** | Event Options | Choices: All Day, Hide From Event Listings, Sticky in Month View, Feature Event |
| **Date** | Start Date |  |
| **Time** | Start Time | Conditional Logic: Show field if **Event Options** is not **All Day** |
| **Date** | End Date |  |
| **Time** | End Time | Conditional Logic: Show field if **Event Options** is not **All Day** |
|  |  |  |

**Tip**: [Gravity Perks Limit Dates](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-limit-dates/) can be used to limit which dates can be selected in the date fields.

## Configuring the Webhook

To configure webhooks for a form, go to your **Form Settings** and click on the **Webhooks** tab and then click the **Add New** button.

Next, using the image below as reference, you’ll need to configure the following settings for the request that is being made.

[![Webhooks Event Calendar Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-10-at-18.16.44.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-10-at-18.16.44.png)

#### Name

Enter a name for your feed. This can be anything you want as it is only used for identification purposes on the feeds list page and in the add-on log.

#### Request URL

Enter **{rest\_api\_url}tribe/events/v1/events**

The [{rest\_api\_url}](https://docs.gravityforms.com/admin_ajax_url-merge-tag/) merge tag will be replaced with the base REST API URL for the current site when the feed is processed.

If the Events Calendar plugin is installed on a different site you will need to substitute the {rest\_api\_url} merge tag with the base REST API URL for that site e.g. http://the-remote-site.local/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/events.

#### Request Method

Select the **POST** choice as the request method.

#### Request Format

Select the **JSON** choice as the request format.

#### Request Headers

There are no request headers to configure.

#### Request Body

Select the **Select Fields** choice.

#### Field Values

Configure rows for the following fields. Click the add item icon (+) to add new rows.

For the values, you can select from the form fields, entry meta, or **Add Custom Value** which will display a text input that supports [Merge Tags](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/).

| Key | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| **title** | Select the **Event Title** choice. |
| **description** | Select the **Event Description** choice. |
| **all\_day** | Select the **All Day** choice. |
| **hide\_from\_listings** | Select the **Hide From Event Listings** choice. |
| **sticky** | Select the **Sticky in Month View** choice. |
| **featured** | Select the **Feature Event** choice. |
| **start\_date** | Select **Add Custom Value** and then enter the merge tags for the start date and time fields e.g. **{Start Date:3} {Start Time:4}** |
| **end\_date** | Select **Add Custom Value** and then enter the merge tags for the end date and time fields e.g. **{End Date:5} {End Time:6}** |

You can also configure rows for any additional fields you may have included on the form which the Events Calendar plugin supports:

| Key | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **author** | The user ID of the event author |
| **date** | The date the event should be published |
| **date\_utc** | The date (UTC timezone) the event should be published |
| **slug** | The event slug |
| **status** | The event post status |
| **timezone** | The event time zone |
| **image** | The event featured image ID or URL |
| **cost** | The event cost |
| **website** | The event website URL |
| **show\_map** | Whether the event should show a map or not (boolean) |
| **show\_map\_link** | Whether the event should show a map link or not (boolean) |

The Events Calendar plugin requires some values (e.g. all\_day) to be passed as booleans. For this, we will use [gform\_webhooks\_request\_data example #3](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_webhooks_request_data/#3-modify-the-field-values-for-the-events-calendar-plugin) in the theme functions.php file or a custom functionality plugin.

#### Webhook Condition

If event creation should be conditional based on the value of a form field, select the **Enable Condition** checkbox and then configure the rules which should be met for this request to be sent.

## Authentication

If you test the form after configuring the webhook you should find it fails to create the event and if [logging is enabled](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-and-debugging/) you would find a line like the following:

> DEBUG –> GF\_Webhooks::process\_feed(): Webhook successfully executed. code: 401; body: {“code”:”rest\_forbidden”,”message”:”Sorry, you are not allowed to do that.”,”data”:{“status”:401}}

Most REST API endpoints will require authentication to ensure that the person making the request has permission to do so. With the Webhooks Add-On you can use the [gform\_webhooks\_request\_args](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_webhooks_request_args) filter in the theme functions.php file or a custom functionality plugin to add the authentication arguments.

[gform\_webhooks\_request\_args example #2](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_webhooks_request_args/#2-set-the-wp-rest-api-cookie-authentication-arguments) shows how you can use the standard cookie authentication for logged-in users making requests to the current site.

If you are making a request to a remote site or the user will not be logged-in on the current site, you would need to use an alternative authentication method such as Basic Authorization as shown in [gform\_webhooks\_request\_args example #3](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_webhooks_request_args/#3-set-the-wp-rest-api-basic-authorization-header).

## Alternative Method

If the Events Calendar plugin is installed locally and you don’t have an Elite or legacy Developer license and would prefer not to [upgrade your existing license](https://docs.gravityforms.com/licensing-faq/#license-upgrades), you could use [gform\_after\_submission example #8](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_after_submission/#8-create-an-events-calendar-plugin-event) in the theme functions.php file or a custom functionality plugin.
