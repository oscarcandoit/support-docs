# gravity\_form\_enqueue\_scripts()

- [Description](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity_form_enqueue_scripts/#h-description)
- [Usage](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity_form_enqueue_scripts/#h-usage)
- [Examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity_form_enqueue_scripts/#h-examples)
- [Placement](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity_form_enqueue_scripts/#h-placement)
- [Source Code](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity_form_enqueue_scripts/#h-source-code)

## Description

This function will enqueue the necessary styles and scripts for the specified Gravity Form. This is useful when manually embedding a form outside the WordPress loop using the function call or to force the stylesheets and scripts to load in the header when using the Form Widget.

**Note**: To correctly enqueue the scripts, this function must be called **before** execution of wp\_head

## Usage

```
gravity_form_enqueue_scripts( $form_id, $is_ajax );
```

## Parameters

- **$form\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)
The form ID of the targeted form.

- **$is\_ajax** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool)

Specify `true` to use ajax form submission. Default value is `false`.


## Examples

The following example uses WordPress [get\_header](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header/) hook, that runs before wp\_head, to call gravity\_form\_enqueue\_scripts for form id 5 in a page that has id 1.

**Note:** The get\_header hook has been proven to work with WordPress default themes, you may need to use a different hook for third-party themes or page builders.

## Placement

gravity\_form\_enqueue\_scripts must be called before wp\_head execution, an easy way to do this is to put the script in the theme’s _header.php_ file just before the `wp_head()` function is called.
