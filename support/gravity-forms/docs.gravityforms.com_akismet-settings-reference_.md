# Akismet Settings Reference

- [Akismet Site Wide Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-settings-reference/#h-akismet-site-wide-settings)
- [Akismet Form Level Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-settings-reference/#h-akismet-form-level-settings)
- [What Happens if I leave the Akismet Settings blank?](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-settings-reference/#h-what-happens-if-i-leave-the-akismet-settings-blank)

## Introduction

There are two places you can find settings related to the Akismet Add-On.

**Site Wide setting**

Available within the [Forms > Settings > Akismet](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-page/) page once the official Akismet plugin has been installed and activated.

**Form Level settings**

Will be enabled once the site-wide setting and the Akismet Add-On are activated, and will allow you to make individual [form setting decisions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-settings/) for the Akismet Add-On.

## Akismet Site Wide Settings

The Akismet Integration toggle, enabled by default on installation, enables or disables Gravity Forms Akismet integration across your entire website.

## Akismet Form Level Settings

Here, you can turn off form-level Akismet checks and map your form fields to Akismet fields to pass them into the Akismet service for analysis. This is only available when the site-wide setting and the Akismet Add-On are activated.

[![Screenshot of the Gravity Forms Akismet Add-On form level settings options. ](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-8-1024x701.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-8.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enable spam check** | This controls whether Akismet is active for this specific form. |
| **First Name** | Specify which form field you want to pass as the author first name when sending your form entry data to the Akismet service. |
| **Last Name** | Specify which form field you want to pass as the author last name when sending your form entry data to the Akismet service. |
| **Email** | Specify which form field you want to pass as the email of the comment author. |
| **Website** | Specify which form field you want to pass as the email of the comment website. |
| **Subject** | Use the [merge tags](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/) selector to choose one or more fields to be concatenated and passed as the subject. Will default to the [{form\_title} merge tag](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form_title-merge-tag/). |
| **Content** | Use the [merge tags](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/) selector to choose one or more fields to be concatenated and passed as the content. You can add multiple merge tags for each field by separating them with a comma. |

The drop-down field mappings will try to default to the first field of a matching type. The Subject defaults to _[{form\_title}](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form_title-merge-tag/),_ and the Content will attempt to default to the merge tag for a [paragraph](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paragraph-text/) or [post body](https://docs.gravityforms.com/post-body/) field.

Embedded forms submitted by logged-in users will send the user role to Akismet. Akismet does not mark submissions by administrators as spam.

**Note**: Akismet will process data submitted via a Form Preview in test mode to prevent those submissions from training the Akismet filters.

## What Happens if I leave the Akismet Settings blank?

When the settings aren’t configured, default mappings will be attempted as follows:

- The entry creator merge tag will be used to get the first and last name, email, and url of the currently logged-in user
- If a user is not logged in or doesn’t have values saved in those user properties, the values from the name, email, and website type fields will be used.
- The values of the following field types will be sent as the content: _address, email, hidden, list, name, number, phone, post\_content, post\_excerpt, post\_tags, post\_title, text, textarea, website._
- Fields with a visibility of administrative will not be used.

- Name


This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
