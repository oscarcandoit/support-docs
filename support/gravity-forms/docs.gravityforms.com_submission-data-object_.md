## Introduction

Submission Data ($submission\_data) is an associative array containing all the payment related properties for the entry being processed by an add-on which extends the [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) class. It is generated by GFPaymentAddOn::get\_submission\_data() during form validation.

## Usage

We recommend accessing the properties in $submission\_data using the rgar() function e.g.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$payment_amount``= rgar(``$submission_data``,``'payment_amount'``);` |
