## Description

The “gform\_sanitize\_confirmation\_message” filter in Gravity Forms is used to sanitize the complete confirmation message just before outputting to the page. All scripts will be removed.

By the time the confirmation is displayed all the field values have been sanitized. However, there may be situations which require and additional level of sanitization. For example, this filter is useful if you’re using merge tags as values for HTML attributes.

| `add_filter(``'gform_sanitize_confirmation_message'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

## Parameters

- **$sanitize\_confirmation\_message** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool)


Indicates if the confirmation message should be sanitized. _Default: false._


## Examples

### Turn on sanitization

|     |
| --- |
