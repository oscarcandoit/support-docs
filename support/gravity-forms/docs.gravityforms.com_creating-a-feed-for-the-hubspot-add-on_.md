## Summary

Before the HubSpot Add-On can be used with Gravity Forms, you will first need to create [a feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/what-is-a-feed/). A feed simply allows form submission data to be sent to another source. In this instance, sending contact information to your HubSpot account.

## Create a Feed

To create a feed to HubSpot using the HubSpot Add-On for Gravity Forms, do the following from your WordPress Admin Dashboard:

1. Click on **Forms** in the left side menu.
2. Select the form that you want to use with HubSpot.
3. Once within your desired form, hover over **Settings** and click on **HubSpot**.
4. Click **Add New** to create a new feed. All the options you are presented with are described in the next section.

## Feed Settings Reference

![Screenshot of HubSpot Feed Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CleanShot-2021-08-11-at-11.52.13.png)

This table describes the feed settings options you will be offered for a HubSpot feed.

| Setting | Description | Image Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | To identify your feed when viewing the feed list page. **Required** | 1 |
| **HubSpot Form Name** | Name of the form that will be automatically created in your HubSpot account to work with this feed. Once created, that form should not be edited or removed. **Required**. | 2 |
| **Lead Status** | Status of the newly created contact in HubSpot. Select a blank row to not assign any status. | 3 |
| **Lifecycle Stage** | The lifecycle stage of the newly created contact in HubSpot. Defaults to _Lead_. | 4 |
| **Contact Owner** | Choose form options:<br>_None_–contact will be unassigned when created. <br>_Select Owner_–automatically assigns the contact to a specific HubSpot user. <br>_Assign Conditionally_–set specific conditions for assigning the owner. | 5 |
| **Map Contact Fields** | Map HubSpot contact fields to the form field that will send that information. Email field is required. | 6 |
| **Add Additional Contact Fields** | Map the additional HubSpot Contact Information properties to the form field you wish it to be filled by. See Field Mapping section below. | 7 |
| **Enable Conditional Logic** | If unchecked, every successful form submission will be sent to HubSpot. If you wish to set specific conditions for sending form data to HubSpot, then check this and fill out your required criteria. | 8 |

## Custom Property Caching

The list of custom fields retrieved from HubSpot is cached for about an hour to stay within HubSpot API limits. This can mean that newly created HubSpot custom properties may not be immediately visible within the configuration menus.

To force update this cache, go to _Forms → Settings → Hubspot_ and click the “Clear Custom Field Cache” button.

![Hubspot Settings page showing the "Clear Custom Fields Cache" option.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hubspot-%E2%80%A2-Settings-%E2%80%A2-Clear-Custom-Fieldss-Cache-1024x309.png)

## Field Mapping

Custom fields can be created within your HubSpot account by using the _Create a Property_ option under the _Actions → [Property Settings](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/manage-your-properties)_ area.

The most recent version of the HubSpot Add-On supports the following field types for mapping to your HubSpot custom properties:

- File upload
- Single line text
- Multi-line text
- Number field
- Date picker
- Single on/off checkbox
- Checkboxes (see below)
- Radio Buttons (see below)
- Drop Down (see below)

When mapping to a Gravity Forms **Radio Buttons** field, enable the [option _Show Values_](https://docs.gravityforms.com/radio-buttons/#h-general-settings) within your form Field Settings and configure the “off” choice value as “false” (you can also leave it empty, as long as the field is not required).

If mapping to a Gravity Forms **Drop Down field**, use the [_Placeholder appearance_ field setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/drop-down/#h-appearance-settings) for the “off” choice, or [enable _Show Values_](https://docs.gravityforms.com/drop-down/#h-general-settings) and configure the “off” choice value as “false”.

Mapping to the Gravity Forms [Consent Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/consent-field/) is supported.

**Important:** When configuring HubSpot fields which support a list of choices, all values for that property must exactly match the _value_ configured for that Gravity Forms choice based field ( **Checkboxes**, **Radio Buttons** and **Drop Down fields**).

Mapping to advanced choice based fields such as Quiz, Poll, and Survey is not supported.

## User Submissions

The first form submission from a user will create the customer record in HubSpot. The customer information will be updated if the user submits the form again using the same email address. A new customer record will be created when a new email address is submitted.

Each browser session is saved under a cookie and each form submission will create/update the same customer. In order to create a new customer record in HubSpot, the user will need to launch a new browser session. This is important to note when creating multiple customers back-to-back whether for testing or addition purposes.
