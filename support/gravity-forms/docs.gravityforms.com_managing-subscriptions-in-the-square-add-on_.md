# Managing Square Subscriptions in Gravity Forms

- [Summary](https://docs.gravityforms.com/managing-subscriptions-in-the-square-add-on/#h-summary)
- [Subscription Details](https://docs.gravityforms.com/managing-subscriptions-in-the-square-add-on/#h-subscription-details)
- [Cancelling Subscriptions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/managing-subscriptions-in-the-square-add-on/#h-cancelling-subscriptions)

## Summary

This article describes how you can interact with Square subscriptions that you have already created with the official **Gravity Forms Square Add-On**.

For information on creating a feed that will turn your form entries into subscriptions, refer to following reference guides:

1. [Set Up the Square Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/)
2. [Set up a Square Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-compatible-form/)
3. [Create a Feed for the Square Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-feed-for-square-add-on/)

## Subscription Details

If an entry has triggered a Square subscription feed, its [entry detail screen](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-detail/) will show a **Subscription Details** box including status, start date, subscription ID, and recurring amount. If the subscription is active, a button that will allow you to **Cancel Subscription** will also be available.

[![Image showing Subscription Details in the Entry view](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-29.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-29.png)

## Cancelling Subscriptions

Canceling a subscription can only be done from the Gravity Forms entry record. **Square does not currently** **provide an interface for canceling subscriptions. Thus if an entry is permanently deleted, there will be no way to cancel the associated subscription.**

Entries that have a subscription status of **Active** will display a **Cancel Subscription** option in the **Subscription Details** section of the entry detail. Clicking the button will cancel the associated subscription.

## Refunding Subscriptions

Refer to [this](https://docs.gravityforms.com/refunds-square/) article for more information about Issuing Refunds with the Square Add-On.
