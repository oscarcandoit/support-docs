# PHP API

## Introduction

The PHP API provides tools for developers to access Gravity Forms when developing in the same server/site as Gravity Forms. Tasks such as developing a new Gravity Forms Add-On, creating a new field type or using a hook or filter to change default Gravity Forms behavior will all be covered here.

## API Functions

- [GFAPI Class](https://docs.gravityforms.com/api-functions)
The GFAPI Class provides developers with a future-proof way to access most of the common core functionality in Gravity Forms such as retrieval and manipulation of form and entry data.

- [Helper Functions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/helper-functions)
Gravity Forms provide these helper functions to assist developers with common operations when extending Gravity Forms.


## Add-on Framework

The Add-On Framework provides basic functionality for developers when creating new add-ons for Gravity Forms. It provides a set of classes that can be extended to facilitate many aspects of developing add-ons such as initialization, settings pages, permissions, feed condition and script enqueuing.

- [Get started with the Add-on Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework)

## Field Framework

The Field Framework provides classes and methods that can be used to create Gravity Forms field types (i.e. Text, Name and Address fields). All Gravity Forms built-in field types use the Field Framework and custom field types can be created as well.

- [Field Classes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/field-framework/field-classes)
Each field class represents a field type (i.e. Text Field, Name Field, etc.) and define properties and methods that control how the field is rendered and how field data is handled.

- [Field Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/field-framework/field-framework-settings)
This section has articles that describe how to add settings to the General, Appearance and Advanced settings tabs of the field editor.


## Constants

Gravity Forms supports a few constants for customization and initialization of data.
