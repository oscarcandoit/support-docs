## Summary

This article provides a guide to checking environment details in Gravity Forms, helping you assess server settings and configurations that affect form functionality.

[![System Status - Environment](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-62-1024x571.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-62.png)

As of Gravity Forms 2.2, it’s possible to see full details on your hosting environment from directly within Gravity Forms. Investigating your environment details is one of the first and most helpful steps when troubleshooting an issue.

## Accessing the System Status Page

To access your environment details, simply access the _System Status_ page. To do so, hover over **Forms** on the left side menu in your WordPress admin, and click on **System Status**.

If the **System Status** menu item is missing on your site there are two possibilities:

- The site is running a version of Gravity Forms which is older than 2.2, please update to the latest version.
- Your user role does not have the gravityforms\_system\_status capability enabled. You can use a [role management](https://docs.gravityforms.com/role-management-guide/) plugin such as Members to enable the [plugin capabilities](https://docs.gravityforms.com/role-management-guide/) for roles.

## Sending System Reports

[![System Status - System Report](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-63-1024x161.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-63.png)

System reports can easily be sent by simply clicking on the **Copy System Report** button at the top of the page. Upon clicking on it, a fully text-based copy of the report will be automatically sent to your clipboard and can be pasted anywhere. This is especially useful to send when submitting a support request.

If you find the system report does not copy to the clipboard, you will want to run through a [theme/plugin conflict test](https://docs.gravityforms.com/testing-theme-plugin-conflict/).

## Understanding the System Status Page

Within the _System Status_ page, there are several items listed and grouped together.

### Gravity Forms Environment

This section contains various information that directly impacts Gravity Forms.

#### Gravity Forms

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Version** | The version of Gravity Forms that is currently active. |
| **Upload folder** | The absolute path to the folder that Gravity Forms will use for file uploads. |
| **Upload folder permissions** | The permissions that Gravity Forms has for your upload folder. It should display Writeable. If not, you may have issues with file upload fields. |
| **Output CSS** | Indicates if outputting of the form stylesheets is enabled or disabled. |
| **Default Theme** | Indicates the [default](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-themes-and-style-settings/) theme used for Form. |
| **No-Conflict Mode** | Indicates if extraneous scripts and styles are being prevented from inclusion on Gravity Forms admin pages, reducing conflicts with other plugins and themes. |
| **Currency** | The currency code the forms are configured to use. |
| **Background updates** | Indicates if Gravity Forms can download and install bug fixes and security updates automatically in the background. |
| **REST API v2** | Indicates if REST API has been enabled on the Forms > Setings > REST API page. |
| **Orbital Style Filter** | Indicates if the [gform\_default\_styles](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_default_styles/) is being used on the site. |

#### Add-Ons

This section will list all Gravity Forms add-ons currently activated on your site, as well as the creator. Official add-ons will state the creator as _Gravity Forms_. 3rd party add-ons will show a different creator.

#### Database

Inside the _Database_ section, information relating to Gravity Forms database tables will be listed. This includes the version number of the Gravity Forms database, as well as the status of the database tables used by Gravity Forms.

Within this section, you can also re-run the database upgrade. If you’re having database-related issues, especially after an update, re-running the database upgrade can often solve them.

#### Translations

This section lists the selected translations for the site and the currently logged-in user. It also lists the installed translations for Gravity Forms and the add-ons.

#### Log Files

The log files section is only displayed if [logging is enabled](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-and-debugging/) and log files exist. It contains links to view each log file.

#### Scheduled (Cron) Events Log

See [Troubleshooting Scheduled Events](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-scheduled-events/#verify-check-the-system-status).

### WordPress Environment

This section contains various details about your WordPress installation.

#### WordPress

This section includes general information about your WordPress installation.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Home URL and Site URL** | The URLs assigned to your WordPress site. Typically, unless you have a specific reason otherwise, these should be the same. |
| **WordPress Version** | The version of WordPress that you are running. |
| **WordPress Multisite** | If this is a multisite installation, it will appear here. |
| **WordPress Memory Limit** | In addition to your memory limit within your PHP configuration, WordPress also sets its own memory limits. The WordPress Memory Limit list item will display the currently set memory limit, as defined within WordPress. |
| **WordPress Debug Mode** | Indicates if WordPress debugging has been enabled using the `WP_DEBUG` constant. |
| **WordPress Debug Log** | Indicates if the `WP_DEBUG_LOG` constant has been used to enable writing of errors to the debug.log file. |
| **WordPress Script Debug Mode** | Indicates if the `SCRIPT_DEBUG` constant has been used to force use of development versions of scripts and styles. |
| **WordPress Cron** | Indicates if the built-in [WP-Cron](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-scheduled-events/#what-is-wp-cron) trigger is enabled. |
| **WordPress Alternate Cron** | Indicates if the alternative, redirect based cron, has been enabled using the [ALTERNATE\_WP\_CRON](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/wp-config-php/#alternative-cron) constant. |
| **Background** **tasks** | Indicates if your site can use the [WordPress HTTP API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/http-api/) to contact itself by sending a post request to its [Admin Ajax URL](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/javascript/ajax/#url). If there is an issue an error message or status code from the test request response will be displayed. |

#### Active Theme

The active theme section will provide information regarding the active theme and it’s parent theme (if applicable).

#### Active Plugins

The active plugins section will provide information regarding what plugins are installed and activated on your site, along with the version number.

### Server Environment

These status items display information related to your server and hosting environment. Often times, you will need to contact your web host if there are any issues here.

#### Web Server

The _Web Server_ section displays information about the software that serves your pages, typically Apache or NGINX. It also includes the document root that the site is being displayed and the port that it is running on (usually ports 80 or 443).

#### PHP

Inside the _PHP_ section, you’ll see information related to PHP options that may impact your site. The most notable of these is _Version_, which should be as high as possible (PHP 7.1 or newer is recommended).

We won’t go over all the items displayed here, but more details related to PHP configurations can be found on the PHP documentation site.

#### Database Server

The database server contains details about the database management system the site is using, such as the version, character set, and collation.

#### Date and Time

Lastly, this section displays the current date and time for WordPress, PHP, and the database.

## Add or Remove Sections

Sections may be added/removed with the [gform\_system\_report](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_system_report/) filter.
