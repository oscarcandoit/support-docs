## Description

Use this filter to enable or disable the confirmation anchor functionality that automatically scrolls the page to the confirmation text or validation message upon submission. This also takes effect when browsing between pages of a multi-page form. The page may also be forced to scroll to a specified distance (pixel) from the top of the page. This hook is useful when embedding forms in a long page.

When the anchor exists, the page scrolls to the top of the form. For non-AJAX forms without the anchor, the page remains at the top of the page upon reload. For AJAX forms without the anchor, the page will not move when the form content is updated. Depending on the page layout, padding and margin changes associated with displaying validation errors may make it appear that the page has scrolled.

When the anchor is set to **true**, the following HTML is added before the opening form tag.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2 | `//the 80 is the form id`<br>`<div id=``'gf_80'``class``=``'gform_anchor'``tabindex=``'-1'``></div>` |

When true, the bookmark for the anchor (#gf\_80 in this example) is also added to the **action** on the form tag.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2 | `<form method=``'post'``enctype=``'multipart/form-data'``id=``'gform_80'`<br>```action=``'/wp.dev/?gf_page=preview&#038;id=80#gf_80'``>` |

## Usage

The following would apply to all forms:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_confirmation_anchor'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

To target a specific form append the form id to the hook name. (format: gform\_confirmation\_anchor\_FORMID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_confirmation_anchor_5'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

## Parameters

- **$anchor** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool)/ [int](https://docs.gravityforms.com/int)
Indicates how the anchor will behave. The default is **true** when AJAX is enabled or for multi-page non-AJAX forms (anchor present), and **false** for single page non-AJAX forms (no anchor).

  - Set **$anchor** to **true** -\> Page will scroll to the position where the form is located.
  - Set **$anchor** to **false** -\> Page will not scroll. For AJAX forms, the page scroll position won’t change when the form is submitted. For non-AJAX forms, the page will remain at the top of document after being reloaded.
  - Set **$anchor** to any numeric value -> Page will be scrolled to the specified pixel value from the top of the document.
- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object)
The current form. Available from Gravity Forms 1.9.17.12.


## Examples

### 1\. Enable for all forms

The following example enables the confirmation anchor on all forms.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_confirmation_anchor'``,``'__return_true'``);` |

### 2\. Disable for a specific form

The following example disables the confirmation anchor for form with ID 5.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_confirmation_anchor_5'``,``'__return_false'``);` |

### 3\. Set scroll distance

The following example causes all AJAX enabled forms to scroll to 20 pixels from the top of the document after being submitted. Only AJAX enabled forms can set the scroll distance.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `add_filter(``'gform_confirmation_anchor'``,``function``() {`<br>```return``20;`<br>`} );` |
