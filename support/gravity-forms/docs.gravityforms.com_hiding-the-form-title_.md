# Hiding the Form Title

- [Hide the Form Title in the Gravity Forms Block Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/hiding-the-form-title/#h-hide-the-form-title-in-the-gravity-forms-block-settings)
- [Hide the Form Title when embedding the form using the shortcode](https://docs.gravityforms.com/hiding-the-form-title/#h-hide-the-form-title-when-embedding-the-form-using-the-shortcode)

## Hide the Form Title in the Gravity Forms Block Settings

The Gravity Forms Block settings provide an option to easily toggle the visibility of the form title without needing to modify any code. By hiding the form title, you can focus attention on the form fields themselves and integrate the form more seamlessly into your page or post layout.

![Image showing Form Title toggle set to false.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-60.png)Set the Form Title toggle to false.

Refer to the [Gravity Forms Block Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-block-settings/) article for reference.

## Hide the Form Title when embedding the form using the shortcode

The Gravity Forms shortcode includes parameters that allow you to control various aspects of the form’s display, including whether the title is shown or hidden. By using the `title` attribute in the shortcode, you can easily hide the form title without needing to make changes in the Gravity Forms settings or the page editor.

| 1 | `[gravityform id="1" title="false"]` |

Refer to the [Creating a Form Shortcode](https://docs.gravityforms.com/shortcodes/) article for reference.

## Hide the Form Title using CSS

Most of the time, you’ll want to hide the form title from the [shortcode](https://docs.gravityforms.com/hiding-the-form-title/#h-hide-the-form-title-when-embedding-the-form-using-the-shortcode) or [block settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/hiding-the-form-title/#h-hide-the-form-title-from-gravity-forms-block-settings), but if you cannot, here’s how to hide the form title using a bit of CSS.

Hide the Form Title for all forms.

|     |
| --- |
| `body .gform_wrapper .gform_heading h``2``.gform_title {`<br>```display``:``none``!important``;`<br>`}` |

Hide the Form Title for Form ID 123.

|     |
| --- |
| `body #gform_wrapper_``123``.gform_heading h``2``.gform_title {`<br>```display``:``none``!important``;`<br>`}` |
