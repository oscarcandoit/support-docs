## Description

The `gform_require_login` filter can be used to override the form `requireLogin` property; does the user need to be logged in to view and use the form?

## Usage

The filter which runs for all forms would be used like so:

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_require_login'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

To limit the scope of your function to a specific form, append the form id to the end of the hook name. (format: gform\_require\_login\_FORMID)

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_require_login_6'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

- **$require\_login** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean/)

Indicates if the user must be logged in to view and use the form. Default is `false`. Will be `true` if the **Require user to be logged in** setting is enabled.
- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object/)

The form currently being vewied or processed.

## Examples

### Enable for ALL forms

This example shows how you can require users to be logged in to view and use all forms.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_require_login'``,``'__return_true'``);` |

### Disable for ALL forms

This example shows how you can enable logged out users to view and use all forms.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_require_login'``,``'__return_false'``);` |

### Perform custom check during multi-file upload

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10 | `add_filter(``'gform_require_login'``,``function``(``$require_login``,``$form``) {`<br>```if``( !``class_exists``(``'GFAsyncUpload'``) ) {`<br>```return``$require_login``;`<br>```}`<br>```// Perform custom checks here.`<br>```// Return false to prevent GFAsyncUpload validating that the user is logged in.`<br>```return``$require_login``;`<br>`}, 10, 2 );` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.

See also the PHP section in this article: [Where Do I Put This Code?](https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-do-i-put-this-code/)

## Since

This filter was added in Gravity Forms v2.4. It was moved to `GFCommon::form_requires_login()` in version 2.6.8.1.

## Source Code
