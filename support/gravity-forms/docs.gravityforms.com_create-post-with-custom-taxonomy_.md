# Create Post with Custom Taxonomy

This snippet will show you how to use the built-in Tags field to create a WordPress post using a non-hierarchical custom taxonomy when using the [Post Fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/design-and-layout/css-selectors/post-fields-css-selectors/).

**Note**: [wp\_insert\_post()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_insert_post/) WordPress core function, used to create the post, checks the user’s capabilities before adding custom taxonomies. This snippet will work only if the user is logged in and has the capability defined in assign\_terms of your custom taxonomy definition.

| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25 | `add_filter(``'gform_post_data'``,``'replace_tags_with_custom_taxonomy'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``replace_tags_with_custom_taxonomy(``$post_data``,``$form``) {`<br>```//only change post type on form id 5`<br>```if``(``$form``[``'id'``] != 5 ) {`<br>```return``$post_data``;`<br>```}`<br>```//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`<br>```// Replace my_taxonomy with your custom taxonomy name as defined in your register_taxonomy() function call`<br>```$custom_taxonomy``=``'my_taxonomy'``;`<br>```//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`<br>``<br>```// Getting tags`<br>```$tags``= implode(``','``,``$post_data``[``'tags_input'``] );`<br>``<br>```// Array of taxonomy terms keyed by their taxonomy name.`<br>```$post_data``[``'tax_input'``] =``array``(``$custom_taxonomy``=>``$tags``);`<br>``<br>```// Set default tags to empty.`<br>```$post_data``[``'tags_input'``] = null;`<br>``<br>```// Return modified post data with the custom taxonomy terms added.`<br>```return``$post_data``;`<br>`}` |

If you need to set the custom taxonomy for non-logged-in visitors, you would need to use the [gform\_after\_submission](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_after_submission/) hook to get the post\_id from the [entry object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object/) and update the post terms using the [wp\_set\_object\_terms](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_set_object_terms) WP core function.
