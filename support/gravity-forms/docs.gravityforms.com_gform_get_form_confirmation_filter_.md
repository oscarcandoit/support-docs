## Description

This filter allows the form confirmation text to be programmatically changed before it is rendered to the page. It was added to accomplish a very specific internal task of enqueuing the scripts and only executes for text confirmations. When filtering confirmations, it is advised that you instead use the filter `gform_confirmation`.

## Usage

Applies to all forms:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_get_form_confirmation_filter'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

To target a specific form append the form id to the hook name. (format: gform\_get\_form\_confirmation\_filter\_FORMID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_get_form_confirmation_filter_10'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

- **$progress\_confirmation** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The confirmation text.
- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object)

The form currently being processed.
