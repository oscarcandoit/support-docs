# Setting Up the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-paypal-payments-standard/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-paypal-payments-standard/#h-setup)

**Note:** PayPal will deprecate Website Payments Standard (WPS) in January 2026, with full End Of Life in January 2027. PayPal Payments Standard Add-On will be affected, and merchants must migrate to PayPal Checkout to maintain payment functionality. Refer to the [PayPal Payments Standard Add-On End Of Life](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=46377&action=edit) article for more information.

PayPal has announced that from September 2024, certain [legacy APIs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/deprecated-resources/) they provide will stop receiving support and customers using them may experience a loss of functionality. If you are using any of our Gravity Forms legacy PayPal Add-Ons ( [PayPal Payments Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-pro-add-on/), [PayPal Payments Standard Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-standard-add-on/), [PayPal Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-pro-add-on/)), we recommend you evaluate the feasibility of migrating to the PayPal Checkout Add-On to avoid possible disruption of services.

## Pre-Requisites

- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the add-on
- A [PayPal Payments Standard](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/referral/paypal-payments-standard) account

**Notice**: As of September 2016, the PayPal IPN will require SSL/HTTPS on all IPN callbacks. If you are using the PayPal IPN, you will need to obtain an SSL certificate.

## Setup

Once you have installed the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On, it’s time to set it up for use. Here’s how to easily set up the add-on to start accepting payments from your form.

1. As the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On uses IPN to receive notifications from PayPal that a payment has been successfully completed, you will need to configure the IPN within PayPal. If you are unsure of how to do so, review our article on [configuring PayPal Standard IPN settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-paypal-standard-ipn-settings/).
2. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
3. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
4. Click the **PayPal Payments Standard** tab.

[![PayPal IPN Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-11.36.34-1.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-09-at-11.36.34-1.png)

5. Select the checkbox labeled **PayPal IPN Setting** to confirm that you have configured your PayPal IPN settings to use the Gravity Forms PayPal Payments Standard Add-On.
6. Click **Update Settings**.

That’s it! The PayPal Payments Standard Add-On is now configured. You’re ready to begin [creating a feed for the PayPal Payments Standard Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/create-feed-paypal-standard-add-on/).
