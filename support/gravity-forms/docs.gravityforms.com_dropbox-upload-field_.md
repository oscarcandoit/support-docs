## Introduction

The Dropbox Upload field uses the Dropbox JavaScript Chooser API to allow your users to select files from their Dropbox account. When the form is submitted, the field value will contain the Dropbox preview links for the selected files.

During submission, if your form also has a Dropbox feed, then the feed processor loops through all selected Dropbox Upload fields for the form and sends a copy request to Dropbox to move the selected files to the Dropbox folder chosen in the feed settings. Once the copy requests are complete, the Gravity Forms entry is updated with the new Dropbox links and notifications are sent out.

## Notes

The Dropbox Upload field is only available when you have configured the add-on to use a custom app. See the [Creating A Custom Dropbox App](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-custom-dropbox-app) article for more details.

If the account the file is being uploaded from is the same as the account is being uploaded to, the Dropbox share link will be to the original file location. Same account includes:

- Uploading from a personal account to the same personal account
- Uploading from a personal account to a business account that is linked to the personal account
- Uploading from a business account to a personal account that is linked to the business account

## General

[![dropbox-upload-general](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dropbox-upload-general-270x300.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dropbox-upload-general.png)

- **Allow multiple files to be selected**


This option allows the user to upload multiple files.
