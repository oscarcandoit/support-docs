## Changing Profile Details

All these items can be modified from your Profile page. From your Gravity account dashboard, go to the Profile tab, shown in the main navigation of your Account area

[![Image showing Account Licenses section](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-22-1024x537.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-22.png)

### Changing Account Name and Organization

1. Click the **Edit Profile** button.
2. Change the name or organization fields.
3. Click the **Save Profile** button.

[![Image showing Profile Information card](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-24.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-24.png)

### Changing your Email Address

1. Click the **Change Email** button
2. Change the current email address to the desired new email address.
3. Click the **Save Email** button. **Your email address change is not yet complete**! A verification email has been sent to the new email address to confirm the correct entry and finalize the change.
4. Find your verification email and click _Confirm Email Address Change_. The email change process will be completed.

Don’t forget that your email address is used as your account login, so remember to check any saved records you may have in a password manager etc., and update the email details there also.

If you wish to reset your password because **you have forgotten it**, see [this help article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/resetting-your-password/).

### Changing your password

1. Click the **Change Password** button.
2. Enter your current password in the **Current Password** field.
3. Enter your new password into the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** fields. A strength indicator indicates the quality of your chosen password. Make sure you record it somewhere!
4. Click **Change Password**. Your changes will be saved immediately, and a confirmation message will be presented.

### Protect Your Password!

Your Gravity password protects your entire account – never share it casually. Anyone with access can change your email, revoke sites, or even transfer your license. Always follow password best practices: Use strong/unique passwords, update them regularly, and don’t reuse them across sites.

If a contractor or developer needs access, share only the license key, not your login. You can copy your license key from the Licenses dashboard.

## Changing Purchase Details

These items are not part of your profile but of the specific subscription you are looking at. For more information, refer to the guides listed below.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-61-1.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-61-1.png)

### Changing Your Payment Method

A payment method is associated with a specific license. So, to change a payment method, you must change it within the subscription it is associated with.

See this article for full details: [Updating your payment method](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-payment-method/).

### Modifying Your Receipt

You can make quick edits to your receipt and save or print a new copy, such as when you have the wrong address listed or similar. Your receipt can be accessed from within the **Your Licenses** area by choosing **Manage License** for the specific license and then viewing the Transactions.

See [this guide for more information](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-do-i-obtain-a-copy-of-my-receipt/). Note that receipt edits are temporary and will not modify any aspects of your profile.

### Adding Tax Information

You can include tax information with your subscription in order to have it show on prints of your invoice/receipts. [This guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-tax-information/) provides information on adding or changing that information for a specific subscription.
