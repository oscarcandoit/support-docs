## How many notifications can I have?

We don’t have any built-in limitation on the number of notifications you can have. By default, there should be an automatic Admin notification on each form created, and many people will create a User notification to send the data to the people that submit the form as well.

Through the use of [conditional logic](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enable-conditional-logic-for-notifications/), you can set-up different notifications to run depending on what a user selects on the form.

## Can I copy a notification to other forms?

Not currently, no. You can create the same notification on multiple forms, but you have to do this manually.

## Can I have one notification for all forms?

Our notification system works on a per form basis. Currently, you cannot control all of the form notifications from one created notification. You will have to edit the notification on each form.

## Why am I not receiving form notification e-mails?

There are many potential reasons you might not receive form notification e-mails. The best way to troubleshoot this issue is to go through the following troubleshooting steps: [Troubleshooting Notifications](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-notifications)

## Can I schedule my notifications for later?

Scheduling a notification for later firing is not a core Gravity Forms function, but it is provided by some third party add-ons. See the [Notification Scheduler](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/notification-scheduler/) from certified developer **GravityWiz**, or [Delayed Email Notification](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/gravity-forms-delayed-email-notifications/) by Ristretto Apps. _Note that third party add-ons are not included, covered or supported by Gravity Forms._
