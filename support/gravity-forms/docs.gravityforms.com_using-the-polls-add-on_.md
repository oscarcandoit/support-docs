## Introduction

The Gravity Forms Polls Add-On allows you to quickly and easily deploy Polls on your website using the power of Gravity Forms. The Polls Add-On allows you to add fields to your form that ask users questions, capture their response, and show them the results of the poll when the form is submitted.

Polls are a great way to interact with your users and receive instant feedback. With the Gravity Forms Polls Add-On you are not limited to just a single poll question. You can add as many Poll Fields to your form as you’d like.

## Setup Your Poll Form

This [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-poll-form/) reviews setting up a Poll Form in the Form Editor.

## Adding a Poll to your Site

There are a few different ways you can add your already-configured poll to your page or post.

- using a [shortcode](https://docs.gravityforms.com/poll-shortcodes/)
- using a Poll Block, chosen from within WordPress block editor. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/polls-block/).
- using a [Poll Widget](https://docs.gravityforms.com/poll-widget/) to insert the poll into your sidebar in site themes that support it. Refer to this [WordPress page on widgets](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-widgets/).

This [article](https://www.gravityforms.com/how-to-add-a-poll-to-your-wordpress-website/) provides an in-depth example of adding a poll to your WordPress website.

Additionally, you can use the Poll specific [merge tags](https://docs.gravityforms.com/poll-merge-tags/) to display poll fields or results, or just a standard Gravity Form block and choose a poll form.

Due to the way they are implemented, each presentation option may not offer the full suite of settings. For most use cases, the Poll Block is the best option, as it has a full suite of controls and a variety of display options. See the article linked below for some more details.

## Displaying Your Poll Results

You have a few options on how you display poll results to site visitors and poll submitters, depending on the method you used to insert the poll on your page. Refer to the article [Displaying your poll results to visitors](https://docs.gravityforms.com/displaying-your-poll-results-to-visitors/) for details.
