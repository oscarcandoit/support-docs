## Pre-Requisites

- Refer to the article [Setup the Square Add-on](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/)

## Introduction

The next step in integrating the Square Add-on is to create the form you are going to use. This can include existing forms. To be compatible with the Square Add-on, your form _must contain_ the following required fields:

- A Pricing field
- A Square field, which provides Credit Card input and Cardholder name
- A Name field
- An Email field
- An Address field

## Available Payment Methods

The Square Add-on supports both Products and Services (one-time payments) as well as Subscriptions (recurring transactions that can be created and managed within Gravity Forms). Please refer to [this document](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-feed-for-square-add-on/) for more details on the available settings for each option.

## Create Your Form

- From the left-hand navigation menu of your WordPress admin dashboard, hover over Forms and click on New Form.
- Enter a **Form Title** and **Form Description**. Click **Create Form**. Alternatively you can hover over **Forms** and click on **Forms** to choose an existing form from the list.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-08-at-09.07.59.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-08-at-09.07.59.png)

- Add fields for capturing standard payment information. We included the **Name**, **Email** and **Address** fields to get basic information from customers. Note: These are required fields for the Feed to Square.
- Add the required fields to your form and configure them as needed. These include **Pricing** fields of your choice. In the example below, the _Shirt_, _Shipping_, and _Total_ serve as the Pricing fields.

[![Square Form Part 2](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-08-at-09.08.06-3.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-08-at-09.08.06-3.png)

- **Add the Square Field** – Expand the Pricing Fields section and add the [Square Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/square-field) to your form to collect payment information via the Square field, which provides Credit Card and Cardholder Name input.
If you have another Payment Gateway add-on installed and active, the Gravity Forms Credit Card Field is still available in case you are allowing users to choose from a list of payment processors, such as Square and Authorize.Net (the standard Credit Card field is needed for Authorize.Net’s processing). Conditional logic can be used to show/hide the Credit Card field depending on the payment processor selection.


- **Square Field Input**: Once you have inserted the Square Field (which is hosted on Square’s servers), you can configure general and specific settings for your [Square Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/square-field/).

## Summary

Now that you have created your form, with pricing fields and a Square field, it is valid for integration with Square. Visit [Creating a Feed for the Square Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-feed-for-square-add-on/) for the next step in the integration process. This is a **critical step**. If it is not completed, **nothing** is sent to Square for processing.

If you need help with creating forms, visit [Creating a Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/getting-started/creating-a-form/) for more information.

## Notes

- When using Page fields to create a multi-page form, the Square field should be located on the last page of the form.
- If you delete the Square field from your form, the Square feeds will automatically deactivate to prevent them from running during form submission, which as the field is missing, would cause a validation error due to Square being unable to capture the card details.
- Your [Gravity Forms Currency Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-page/#general-settings) **must match** the Currency Settings in your Square account

- URL


This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
