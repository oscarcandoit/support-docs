Gravity Forms and Square are offering a “ **Free Processing Promotion**” for new Square customers that can save you credit card fees for up to 180 days. [Go here for details.](https://squareup.com/t/cmtp_performance/pr_developers/d_partnerships/p_gravityforms/?route=i/FED2CBC66C)

## Introduction

The official Gravity Forms Square Add-On allows you to quickly and easily capture one-time credit card payments with WordPress and your Square account.

## Prerequisites

- You will of course need Gravity Forms and the official [Gravity Forms Square Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) installed and activated.
- SSL Certificate Installed and Configured
- A [Square account](https://squareup.com/t/cmtp_performance/pr_developers/d_partnerships/p_gravityforms/?route=i/FED2CBC66C) (a [Square Sandbox account](https://squareup.com/t/cmtp_performance/pr_developers/d_partnerships/p_gravityforms/l_us/lang_en/?route=/signup?country_code=US&v=developers) is also recommended, but optional)

Because of the secure nature of capturing credit card information, you will be required to install an SSL certificate on your web site if you have not already done so. You will also need to configure your WordPress site to work properly with SSL.

Contact your web host if you need assistance purchasing and configuring an SSL certificate.

If you need assistance configuring your WordPress site to work with SSL, we recommend the WordPress HTTPS (SSL) Plugin which you can find here: [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/)

## Setup Square

Learn how to setup the Square Add-on in our [Setting Up the Square Add-on article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/).

## Setup Your Form

Refer to the [Setting up a Square Compatible Form article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-compatible-form/) for detailed instructions on how to setup your form to be compatible with the Square Add-on.

## Setting up a Square Feed

Now that you have configured the Square Add-on to work with your Square account, and you have a form configured, it’s time to bring it all together by configuring the form to send it’s submissions to Square. Just like all of our Gravity Forms Add-ons, this is done by creating a feed.

Review our [Creating a Feed for the Square Add-on article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-feed-for-square-add-on/) for step-by-step instructions.

## Viewing Sales Results

After creating a feed and making your first sale, you can view the results on the Sales Results page.  Review [Viewing Sales Results](https://docs.gravityforms.com/viewing-sales-results/) article for more information.

## Important Notes

- The currency setting for your Square Account must match your [Gravity Forms Currency Setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-page/). if not matched, you will get an error when you attempt to connect to your Square account.

## Square Add-On Hooks

The Square Add-On provides hooks that can be used to modify the default functionality or extend it. For more information, review the [Square Add-On Hooks](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/hooks/filters/filters-addons/square-filters/).

## Add-On Framework Hooks

Because the Square Add-On is built using the Add-On Framework it also inherits any hooks available in the framework methods it uses such as:

[gform\_{$SHORT\_SLUG}\_field\_value](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_slug_field_value/) for changing a field value before it is passed to Square.

- Instagram
