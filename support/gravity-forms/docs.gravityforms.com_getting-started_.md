## Welcome To Gravity Forms!

Getting started with Gravity Forms is a simple process, but there are a few steps you need to take. If you’re already familiar with installing WordPress plugins, you’re already ahead of the game.

In this article we have a checklist of the things you will need to do from the first moment you decide to use Gravity Forms, and links to a selection of the articles that can help you do it!

## The Basics

1. Review our [system requirements](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-system-requirements/).
2. [Purchase](https://docs.gravityforms.com/purchasing-a-gravity-forms-license/) and pay for a Gravity Forms license key, which will then add your new license key to [your Gravity Forms account](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/your-gravity-forms-account/managing-your-account/). If you need to try out some functionality first, you can experiment with our fully functional [online demo](https://www.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-demo/).
3. [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installation/) the Gravity Forms plug-in from your account.
4. [Install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms/) the Gravity Forms plug-in.
5. [Enter your license key](https://docs.gravityforms.com/finding-your-license-key/) to validate your installation of Gravity Forms.
6. [Create](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-form/) your first form, and then start testing it out in the preview view, or [add it to your test site](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/getting-started/add-form-to-site/) and experiment!

You are up and running!
