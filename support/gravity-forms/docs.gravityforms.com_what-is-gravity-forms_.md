# What is Gravity Forms?

- [What It Isn't](https://docs.gravityforms.com/what-is-gravity-forms/#h-what-it-isn-t)

## What It Is

Gravity Forms is a WordPress plugin that allows site owners, admins, and developers to create simple and complex forms to collect information on their WordPress site and then decide what to do with that information. Gravity Forms can be used for contact forms, WordPress post creation, calculators, employment applications and more. Check out this [library of available templates](https://www.gravityforms.com/form-templates/) for just a taste of some of the things you can do.

We also offer numerous official add-ons ​that help you integrate your form submissions with numerous external services (such as Stripe, PayPal, Square, Zapier, or Mailchimp). See a [full list of official add-ons here](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/).

On top of that, we offer a robust number of WordPress hooks and a fully featured API to enable developers to modify and extend the functionality we provide, and enable third parties to produce an extensive number of additions to the core functionality. Refer to our [developer documentation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/), and our [repository of third party add-ons](https://www.gravityforms.com/community/add-ons/) that work with Gravity Forms for a sample of what exists.

Written in PHP, Gravity Forms uses many WordPress built-in functions and features to power its form builder. It also uses the same MySQL database system as WordPress, but stores all forms and entries in its own tables. Gravity Forms is open source and GPL licensed. All of the code included is unencrypted.

## What It Isn’t

Gravity Forms is not a [SaaS service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). We do not host your forms, collect or store your form submissions. All that occurs on your designated WordPress website host where you install Gravity Forms.

Gravity Forms is not a design agency. We cannot contract to design or integrate your forms into your website.

We at Gravity Forms are unavailable for custom coding, but the experienced developers at Codeable are! You can visit their website directly [here](https://www.codeable.com/?ref=6wHxq) or review our [article on custom development](https://docs.gravityforms.com/custom-development/).
