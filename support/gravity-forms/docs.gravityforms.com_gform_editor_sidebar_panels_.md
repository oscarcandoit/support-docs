## Description

The gform\_editor\_sidebar\_panels filter enables custom panels to be registered for display in the form editor sidebar. Use the [gform\_editor\_sidebar\_panel\_content](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_editor_sidebar_panel_content) action hook to echo the panel content.

## Usage

The filter which would run for all forms would be used like so:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_editor_sidebar_panels'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

You can also target a specific form by adding the form id after the hook name.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_editor_sidebar_panels_6'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
