# Setting Up A Sample Poll Form

- [Scenario](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-sample-poll-form/#h-scenario)
- [Create Your Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-sample-poll-form/#h-create-your-form)
- [Immediate Results](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-sample-poll-form/#h-immediate-results)
- [Next Steps](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-sample-poll-form/#h-next-steps)

## Scenario

In this example, we will set up a Poll Form asking what the user’s favorite video game genre is.

## **Create Your Form**

After installing and activating the Polls Add-On, you can add a Poll field to your form.

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **New Form** under the **Forms** navigation or choose an existing form from **Edit Forms**.
2. Click on the **Poll** field under the Advanced Fields toolbox to add a Poll field to your form.
3. Under **Poll Question** type “What is your favorite game genre?”
4. Configure your Poll Type as a Radio Button
5. For the **Choices** we will add FPS, RTS, and RPG.
6. Let’s setup another Poll field with a **Poll Question** of “What is your favorite game system and **Choices** of “Xbox, Playstation, and Computer”.
7. For both fields we will check the **Enable “other” choice** option to allow the user to add their own unique choice.
8. Update your form.

## Immediate Results

By default, the Poll results are displayed upon submission of the form. You can adjust how these results are displayed in the [Poll Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/poll-settings/).

Let’s leave the settings as they are for now and click preview and submit the form. Your results should look something like the image below depending on your choices.

## Next Steps

Now that your form is has been created and your results are displaying properly you can **Add the Poll to your Site** and **View the Poll Results**. Both of these topics are reviewed in the [Using the Polls Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-the-polls-add-on/) article.
