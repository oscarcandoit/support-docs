# Adding a Note to the Entry when Using the Add-On Framework

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-note-when-using-addon-framework/#h-introduction)
- [add\_note()](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-note-when-using-addon-framework/#h-add_note)

- [note\_avatar()](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-note-when-using-addon-framework/#h-note_avatar)

## Introduction

There are times when using the [Add-On Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework/) you may want to add a note to the entry. There are two methods available, add\_note() and add\_feed\_error().

## add\_note()

Adds a note to the entry.

Any add-on which extends [GFAddon](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfaddon), [GFFeedAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gffeedaddon), or [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) can use add\_note().

**Note**: Prior to Gravity Forms 1.9.12, this was only available to add-ons which extended GFPaymentAddOn().

|     |
| --- |
| `$this``->add_note(``$entry``[``'id'``],``'Mailing list subscription failed.'``,``'error'``);` |

**Parameters**

- **$entry\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)
The ID of the entry the note should be added to.

- **$note** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The note to be added to the entry.

- **$note\_type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string) \| [null](https://docs.gravityforms.com/null)

Default is null. When a note type is specified it is appended to the class attribute of the div element which contains the note as gforms\_note\_{$note\_type}. There are two built-in class names: gforms\_note\_error and gforms\_note\_success.


## add\_feed\_error()

Adds an error type note to the entry and writes an error to the add-on log.

Any add-on which extends [GFFeedAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gffeedaddon) or [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) can use add\_feed\_error().

**Note**: This function was added in Gravity Forms 1.9.12.

|     |
| --- |
| `$this``->add_feed_error(``'Mailing list subscription failed.'``,``$feed``,``$entry``,``$form``);` |

**Parameters**

- **$error\_message** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The note to be added to the entry and logged to the add-on log when the [Logging Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-and-debugging/) is enabled.

- **$feed** [Feed Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/feed-object)

The feed currently being processed.

- **$entry** [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object)

The entry currently being processed.

- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object)

The form currently being processed.


## note\_avatar()

In this example, we are using a file named img\_48x48.png which, is stored in the add-ons images directory.

|     |
| --- |
| `public``function``note_avatar() {`<br>```return``$this``->get_base_url() .``"/images/img_48x48.png"``;`<br>`}` |
