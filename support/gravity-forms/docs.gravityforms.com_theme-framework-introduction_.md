# Theme Framework Introduction

- [Considerations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/theme-framework-introduction/#h-considerations)

In Gravity Forms 2.7, we introduced the Theme Framework. This system provides a foundation for creating, building, and extending form themes for developers and non-technical users throughout the Gravity Forms ecosystem. The Theme Framework fundamentally changes how users and developers control the appearance of their forms and is intended to integrate with future WordPress themes and full-site editing.

## Considerations

The Theme Framework was built to be as robust and flexible as possible, allowing it to be used in a wide variety of situations by users and developers of varying expertise. You can interact with the Theme Framework in many ways, such as block settings, CSS files, or Global Styles.

This new system provides a lot of power and flexibility, but like any complex system, it will be most useful as we all move to adopt it. By aligning on a centralized framework across first-party and third-party developer solutions, we can more easily ensure that the broader Gravity Forms ecosystem provides a consistent, clear, and performant experience for all our users.

As WordPress and Gravity Forms create more ways for users to control the appearance of their sites, the flexibility of the Theme Framework will ensure that it can respond to the changing landscape of WordPress development, including the future standardization of theme.json (eventually you will be able to create your form styles in your theme.json file).
