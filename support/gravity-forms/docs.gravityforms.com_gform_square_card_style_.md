# gform\_square\_card\_style

This filter was removed from the Square Add-On and is no longer supported. From Gravity Forms Square Add-On version 1.7, the look of the Square field can be managed via the [gform\_square\_card\_details\_style](https://docs.gravityforms.com/?p=32605) filter.

## Description

This filter allows you to pass CSS-like properties and values to Square to control the look of the Square field.

For more information about which styles may be applied, check out the [style reference](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/api/paymentform#datatype-inputstyleobjects) in Square’s documentation.

## Usage

```
add_filter( 'gform_square_card_style', 'your_function_name', 10, 2 );
```

## Parameters

- **$default\_styles** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)
Array that contains css properties and their values, property names and values should match inputStyle documentation [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/api/paymentform#datatype-inputstyleobjects).

- **$form\_id** [int](https://docs.gravityforms.com/int)

The current form id.


## Examples

Changes the card details field background to black and text color to white.

```
add_filter( 'gform_square_card_style', 'change_style', 10, 2 );
function change_style( $default_styles, $form_id ) {
    $default_styles['backgroundColor'] = '#000000';
    $default_styles['color'] = '#ffffff';
    return $default_styles;
}
```

## Placement

This code should be placed in the [functions.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Functions_File) file of your active theme.

## Since

This filter was added in Square version 1.0.

## Source Code

This filter is located in GF\_Square::register\_init\_scripts() in _gravityformssquare/class-gf-stripe.php_.
