# My Download Is Not a Zip File?

- [Issue](https://docs.gravityforms.com/my-download-is-not-a-zipfile/#h-issue)
- [Probable Cause](https://docs.gravityforms.com/my-download-is-not-a-zipfile/#h-probable-cause)

## Issue

To install a WordPress plugin, you need a zip file, which is how we provide Gravity Forms and Gravity Forms add-ons upon download. But what if your download is not a zip file?

## Probable Cause

This likely means you that your browser is automatically opening (unzipping) the file at the time of download. This is a user preference within your browser settings.

For example, in Safari:

1. Open Safari >Preferences >General
2. Uncheck “Open Safe Files After Downloading”
3. Re-download the file.

[![Safari General Preferences Panel](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Safari-Genera-Preferences.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Safari-Genera-Preferences.png)

Screenshot shows Safari Preferences panel, as of Safari 14.0
