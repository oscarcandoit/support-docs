## Summary

Your Gravity account, hosted on [gravity.com](https://gravity.com/), is the hub for your **Gravity Forms** and **Gravity SMTP** subscriptions and downloads, as well as access to your user profile, billing information, receipts, and more. This article gives a quick overview of the Account section of our website. For more details on each area, check out the articles that are linked below.

A Gravity account is created for you automatically when you purchase a Gravity Forms license. Alternatively, you can register one without making a purchase. Refer to [this](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-an-account/) help guide for more information on account creation.

## Where do I log in?

Click the login link at the far right of the top nav from any of our _gravityforms.com_ website pages.

[![The Gravity Forms website top navigation bar, showing the login action.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-24-at-08.49.52@2x-1024x138.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-24-at-08.49.52@2x.png)

On a smaller screen or mobile device, the menu may be hidden under the “stack” or “hamburger” icon in the top left corner of the page, as shown below.

## How do I log in?

To access your My Account section, you must log in with your account email address (as used when you purchased) and password. If you bought a new license, an account was created for you automatically. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-an-account/) for information on how to create an account without making a purchase.

If you have forgotten your password or you are logging in for the first time, you can reset it using the instructions in the [Resetting Your Password](https://docs.gravityforms.com/resetting-your-password) article.

The **Remember Me** checkbox will save your login information to your computer via a cookie.

[![Image showing My Account button in Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CleanShot-2024-03-08-at-14.55.13@2x.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CleanShot-2024-03-08-at-14.55.13@2x.png)

You will see a **My Account** button in the top right of the main site menu if you are already logged in. Clicking this will take you to the Account section.

## Account Section

Once logged in, you can access the three major sections of the My Account area within the navigation tabs.
