# Form Data

- [Usage](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-data/#h-usage)

## Introduction

Form Data ($form\_data) is an associative array containing the payment related properties for the entry being processed by the Authorize.Net add-on which extends the [GFPaymentAddOn](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gfpaymentaddon) class. It is populated using the values from the [Submission Data Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/submission-data-object) generated during form validation.

## Usage

We recommend accessing the properties in $form\_data using the rgar() function, e.g.:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$form_data``= rgar(``$submission_data``,``'payment_amount'``);` |

## Properties

- **form\_title** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The form title.

- **email** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The value of the field which was mapped to the billing information Email field.

- **address1** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The value of the field which was mapped to the billing information Address field.

- **address2** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The value of the field which was mapped to the billing information Address 2 field.

- **city** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The Credit Card cardholder first name.

- **last\_name** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The Credit Card cardholder last name.

- **amount** [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float)

Either the form total or the value of the field mapped to the feeds payment amount or recurring amount setting.

- **fee\_amount** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

Zero or the value of the field mapped to the setup fee setting.

- **line\_items** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An indexed array of line items with unit prices greater than or equal to zero. Created from the submitted pricing fields. See [Line Item](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-data/#line-item) for available properties.


### Line Item

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8 | `array``(`<br>```'item_id'``=> 1,`<br>```'item_name'``=>``'Product A'``,`<br>```'item_description'``=>``''``,`<br>```'item_quantity'``=>``'1'``,`<br>```'item_unit_price'``=> 10,`<br>```'item_taxable'``=>``'Y'``,`<br>`)` |

Each line item is an associative array containing the following properties.

- **item\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)
The field ID.

- **item\_name** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The product name or shipping name.

- **item\_description** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Comma separated string of selected option names.

- **item\_quantity** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The quantity.

- **item\_unit\_price** [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float)

The total unit price for the product and any selected options or the shipping price.

- **item\_taxable** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
