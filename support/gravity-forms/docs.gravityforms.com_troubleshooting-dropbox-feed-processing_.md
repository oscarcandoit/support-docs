# Troubleshooting Dropbox Feed Processing

- [Requirements](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-dropbox-feed-processing/#h-requirements)
- [Logging](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-dropbox-feed-processing/#h-logging)
- [Common Issues](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-dropbox-feed-processing/#h-common-issues)
- [Basic Authentication](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-dropbox-feed-processing/#h-basic-authentication)
- [cURL Error 28](https://docs.gravityforms.com/troubleshooting-dropbox-feed-processing/#h-curl-error-28)

## Requirements

For Dropbox feed processing to work the following requirements must be met:

- See the [Gravity Forms System Requirements](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-system-requirements) article for more details.
- The site needs to be able to send a post request to it’s admin-post.php URL using the WordPress HTTP API to trigger processing of the uploaded files.

## Logging

Begin troubleshooting by:

(1) Enable logging on the **Forms > Settings** page

(2) On the **Forms > Settings > Logging** page, ensure that Gravity Forms Core and any add-ons are enabled and set to **log all messages**.

[Check our logging and debugging documentation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-and-debugging/) for additional help.

As logging statements are only recorded when the functions they are contained within are run, perform the steps needed to replicate the issue such as submitting the form.

Example logging statements to look for in the add-on log:

> DEBUG –> GFFeedAddOn::maybe\_process\_feed(): Checking for feeds to process for entry #\[entry id\] for gravityformsdropbox.
>
> DEBUG –> GFFeedAddOn::maybe\_process\_feed(): Starting to process feed (# – ) for entry #\[entry id\] for gravityformsdropbox
>
> DEBUG –> GF\_Dropbox::initialize\_api(): Testing API credentials.

## Common Issues

If you find feed processing ends with the following logging statement that indicates something is preventing the WordPress admin-post.php from processing the request.

> DEBUG –> GF\_Dropbox::maybe\_process\_feed\_on\_shutdown(): Sending processing request for feed #.

### Basic Authentication

If your site is using basic authentication that would cause the request to fail with a 401 unauthorized error. To resolve this issue you can add the Authorization header to the request using the WordPress http\_request\_args filter e.g.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8 | `add_filter(``'http_request_args'``,``'http_request_args_basic_auth_admin_post'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``http_request_args_basic_auth_admin_post(``$args``,``$url``) {`<br>```if``(``strpos``(``$url``, admin_url(``'admin-ajax.php'``) ) === 0 ) {`<br>```$args``[``'headers'``][``'Authorization'``] =``'Basic '``.``base64_encode``( USERNAME .``':'``. PASSWORD );`<br>```}`<br>```return``$args``;`<br>`}` |

Note: The above example is based on USERNAME and PASSWORD being constants defined elsewhere (i.e. the wp-config.php file), if not, you can include the values within the quotes e.g. `'USERNAME:PASSWORD'`.

### cURL Error 28

> ERROR –> GF\_Dropbox::maybe\_process\_feed\_on\_shutdown(): Aborting. cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 1000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received

For assistance resolving cURL timeouts like this please see the [cURL error 28 in WordPress](https://www.samuelaguilera.com/post/curl-error-28-wordpress) article.
