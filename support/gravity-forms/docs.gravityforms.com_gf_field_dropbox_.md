## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_Dropbox class extends the GF\_Field class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object), it’s responsible for determining how the Dropbox Upload field is rendered when the form is displayed and how it’s value is handled during and after submission.

## Properties

These are the properties used by the Dropbox Upload field, which can be found in the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object), available to many of the hooks throughout Gravity Forms and some add-ons.

- **type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The field type, which in this case is **dropbox**.

- **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The field ID.

- **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages.

- **adminLabel** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The label to be used on admin pages instead of the label, useful for fields with long labels.

- **isRequired** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the field requires the user to select a file for upload. Marking the field as required will prevent the form from being submitted if a file is not selected. Default is false.

- **errorMessage** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom error message to be displayed if the field fails validation.

- **labelPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label visibility. Empty when using the form defaults or a value of ‘hidden\_label’.

- **descriptionPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field description position. Empty when using the form defaults, a value of ‘below’ to position the description below the input container, or a value of ‘above’ to position the description above the input container.

- **multiselect** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Allow multiple files to be selected? Default is false.

- **allowedExtensions** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

A comma separated string of allowed file extensions. e.g. jpg,gif,png

- **formId** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The ID of the form this field is located on.

- **pageNumber** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The form page this field is located on. Default is 1.

- **conditionalLogic** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object) for more details.

- **description** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field description.

- **cssClass** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom CSS class or classes to be added to the li tag that contains the field.


## Dynamic Population

Unfortunately the Dropbox Upload field does not currently support dynamic population.

## Calculations Support

Unfortunately the Dropbox Upload field can’t currently be used with calculations; we do have this on the feature request list.

## Conditional Logic Support

Unfortunately you can’t configure conditional logic rules on other fields based on the Dropbox Upload field; we do have this on the feature request list.

## $entry Value

The Dropbox Upload field stores file urls in the [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object) as a string in the following format:

`["https://www.dropbox.com/link-one","https://www.dropbox.com/link-two"]`

When accessing the field value in the [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object) you will most likely want to decode the above so you can do something with each url. Here’s an example:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `$value``= rgar(``$entry``,``'3'``);`<br>`$files``= json_decode(``$value``, true );`<br>`foreach``(``$files``as``$file``) {`<br>```// do something with the $file`<br>`}` |

## Merge Tags

The field merge tag available via the merge tag drop down in notifications and confirmations will return the field value. Each URL will be returned on it’s own line.

`{[Field Label]:[field_id]}` e.g. `{Dropbox Upload:3}`

The Dropbox Upload field does not have any modifiers for the field merge tag.

The `{all_fields}` merge tag will return an unordered HTML list. For each list item the filename will be wrapped in a HTML link. If the notification format is changed to text then the value returned will be identical to that returned when using the field merge tag.

## Useful Methods

GF\_Field\_Dropbox inherits it’s available methods from GF\_Field and overrides a few of them where necessary to provide its required appearance and functionality. Here are a few methods which can be useful when writing custom code.

### get\_value\_export()

The get\_value\_export() method formats the entry value before it is used in entry exports and by framework add-ons that integrate with third-party services, however, you can use it in your custom code when interacting with the [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object), [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) and [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object).

**Usage Examples**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `// if you have access to the $field object`<br>`$value``=``$field``->get_value_export(``$entry``);`<br>`// if you don't have access to the $field object`<br>`$value``= GF_Field_Dropbox::get_value_export(``$entry``,``$input_id``);` |

- **$entry** [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object)
The entry from which the field value should be retrieved. Required.

- **$input\_id** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The ID of the field for which the value should be retrieved. Required when not using $field. Defaults to the $field->id property when not supplied.

- **Returns** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The file url. If the entry value contains multiple urls then they will be separated by a comma with a space either side e.g.

`https://www.dropbox.com/link-one , https://www.dropbox.com/link-two`
