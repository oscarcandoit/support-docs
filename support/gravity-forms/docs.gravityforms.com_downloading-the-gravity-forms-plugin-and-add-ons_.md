## Who Can Download Add-Ons?

Access to download files is available only to **active** Gravity Forms subscribers whose subscriptions are paid in full and have not expired. If you have stopped future subscription renewals, you will have access to files until your license expiry date.

## Which Add-Ons Can I Download?

The add-ons and products you are entitled to via your [Downloads page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) are determined by the type ofGravity Forms subscription you have. You can see your list of permitted Downloads by logging into your [Account](http://gravityforms.com/my-account) page and following the instructions below. See this page for a searchable [list of first-party Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/) [add-ons](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/) and the license level to which they are available.

Your subscription may also grant you temporary or ongoing access to other software we produce, such as beta releases, experimental tools, and possibly even additional Gravity products, such as [Gravity SMTP](https://www.gravityforms.com/gravity-smtp/).

## Download via the Gravity Forms Website

1. Log into your [Gravity Forms account dashboard](http://gravityforms.com/my-account) and go to the **Downloads** section.

2. Alternatively, you can choose an active license from the drop down menu and list available downloads for that specific license.

**Note**: Files will download in the ZIP archive file format. **Do not unzip it** (and do not allow your browser to unzip it automatically). When you install the package, you will upload it in the ZIP format. If your file was unzipped automatically on download, [see this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/my-download-is-not-a-zipfile/) for a possible solution.

## Install Via WordPress admin

1. Login to your WordPress site’s admin dashboard.
2. Go to the admin area _Forms → Add-Ons [.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-the-gravity-forms-plugin-and-add-ons/#b-wordpress-admin-add-on-area)_ From here you can install any official Gravity Forms add-on permitted by your license level directly to your site.
