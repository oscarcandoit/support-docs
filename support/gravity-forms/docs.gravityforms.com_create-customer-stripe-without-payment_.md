# Create a Customer in Stripe without Capturing Payment

- [Overview](https://docs.gravityforms.com/create-customer-stripe-without-payment/#h-overview)
- [Using Stripe 5.2 or newer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/create-customer-stripe-without-payment/#h-using-stripe-5-2-or-newer)
- [Using a Stripe version older than 5.2](https://docs.gravityforms.com/create-customer-stripe-without-payment/#h-using-a-stripe-version-older-than-5-2)

## Overview

You can create a customer in your Stripe.com dashboard and include their payment details without actually charging the customer. The method you use to do this will depend on which version of the Stripe Add-On you are using.

Following this tutorial, when the form is submitted and passes validation the customer will be created in your Stripe account. A charge will also be created based on how the feed is configured but it will not be captured when the entry is saved. **Stripe will automatically expire the authorized charges if not captured within seven days**.

## Using Stripe 5.2 or newer

This version of the add-on adds a new setting to the [Stripe field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-field/) which uses a newer implementation of the Stripe integration that will automatically create the customer during submission.

1. Follow steps 1 to 4 listed in the previous section of this documentation page.
2. Check the “ **Use Stripe’s Payment Element**” setting in your [Stripe Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-field/) settings., and save your form.
3. To send the transaction as **authorize only**, add the snippet for step 6 in the previous section of this documentation, and this one too: [gform\_stripe\_payment\_element\_authorization\_only example](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_payment_element_authorization_only/)

Skip this point if you want to actually charge the customer.
4. Add the snippet for step 7 in the previous section of this documentation, and this one too: [gform\_stripe\_payment\_element\_initial\_payment\_information](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_payment_element_initial_payment_information/#h-1-allow-setup-future-usage-for-products-and-services)

## Using a Stripe version older than 5.2

**Note:** The following requires our Stripe Add-On version 3.4 or newer. Payment method must be set to [Stripe Credit Card Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-installing-the-stripe-add-on/#payment-collection-stripe-v2-6-).

1. Go to Form Settings > Stripe > Add New.
2. Give the new feed a name and for the transaction type select **Product and Services**.
3. The payment amount can be set to either the form total or a product field, it doesn’t matter which as long as the **amount is greater than zero** and conforms to [Stripe.com minimum amount requirements](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the **customer won’t actually be charged**.
4. Map the **Stripe Receipt** setting to the form field which contains the customers email address.
5. Add this [gform\_stripe\_customer\_id example](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_customer_id/#h-2-create-new-customer) to your site [as usual](https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-do-i-put-this-code/#php), replacing the feed names in **$feed\_names** with the actual names of your feeds, and optionally updating the id numbers for name and phone fields. This will create the customer.
6. Add this [gform\_stripe\_charge\_authorization\_only example](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_charge_authorization_only/#h-2-apply-to-a-specific-feed) to send the transaction as **authorize only**. Skip this point if you want to actually charge the customer.
7. Finally add this [gform\_stripe\_charge\_pre\_create example](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_charge_pre_create/#h-2-attach-payment-method-to-the-customer) to save the payment method to the customer.
