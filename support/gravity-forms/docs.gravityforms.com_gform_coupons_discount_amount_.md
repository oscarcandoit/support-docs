## Description

This filter can be used to modify the coupon discount before it is applied to the form total.

## Usage

The gform\_coupons\_discount\_amount filter has both a [JavaScript version](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_coupons_discount_amount/#javascript-version) and a [PHP version](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_coupons_discount_amount/#php-version). **Both versions should be used.**

The JavaScript version only modifies the coupon discount on the front-end.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `gform.addFilter(``'gform_coupons_discount_amount'``,``function``(discount, couponType, couponAmount, price, totalDiscount) {`<br>```// do stuff`<br>```return``discount;`<br>`});` |

The PHP version modifies the coupon discount during submission, ensuring that the pricing data used to create the entry and used with payment add-ons is updated.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_coupons_discount_amount'``,``function``(``$discount``,``$coupon``,``$price``,``$entry``) {`<br>```// do stuff`<br>```return``$discount``;`<br>`}, 10, 4 );` |

## JavaScript Version

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **$discount** | [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float) | The discount amount. |
| **$couponType** | [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float) | The `couponAmountType` from the [Coupons Feed Meta](https://docs.gravityforms.com/coupons-feed-meta). |
| **$couponAmount** | [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float) | The discount amount from the [Coupons Feed Meta](https://docs.gravityforms.com/coupons-feed-meta). |
| **$price** | [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float) | The form total excluding discounts. |
| **$totalDiscount** | [float](https://docs.gravityforms.com/float) | The total discount from all currently applied coupons. |

### Examples

This example shows how you can adjust the coupon discount for logged-in users.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `gform.addFilter(``'gform_coupons_discount_amount'``,``function``(discount, couponType, couponAmount, price, totalDiscount) {`<br>```// You would need to write your own JS-version of is_user_logged_in()`<br>```if``(isUserLoggedIn()) {`<br>```discount += 5;`<br>```}`<br>```return``discount;`<br>`});` |
