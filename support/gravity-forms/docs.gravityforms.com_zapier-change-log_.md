- Fixed an issue where attempting to publish a Zap returns a production.ERROR on Zapier.
- Updated authentication to check for read/write permissions on the REST API Key.

### 4.5.0 \| 2025-09-04

- Updated "Steps to Connect a Zap" to provide a correction.

### 4.4.0 \| 2025-03-19

- AF: Updated process\_feed() return value for compatibility with Gravity Forms 2.9.4, so the framework can save the feed status to the entry meta.

### 4.3.0 \| 2024-03-06

- Added support for async (background) feed processing to improve form submission performance.
- Fixed an issue which causes entries from translated sites to fail.

### 4.1 \| 2021-05-04

- Added support for displaying real entry data for the selected form when configuring a Zap.
