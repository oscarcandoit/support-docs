## Introduction

This quick reference guide lists all the settings related to the Moderation Add-On, and includes a short description of their purpose.

**Site-wide settings** are available within the [Gravity Forms Settings page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-page/), where you should find a _Moderation_ tab within the left-hand list.

**Form-level settings** will be enabled once the site-wide settings are activated, and allow you to make individual [form setting decisions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-settings/) for the Moderation Add-On.

## Add-On Settings

![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/perspectiveapi-1024x287.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Perspective API Key | To use Moderation, you will need a Perspective API key. A green checkmark indicates a valid API key. |

![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/moderation-settings-1024x905.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Toxicity Score Threshold | Set your own score threshold between 0 (not toxic) and 1 (very toxic) to control what entries are marked as toxic. The default value is 0.5. **A leading 0 is required** |
| Attributes to Filter | Select what kind of content you’d like to block in your form entries. Note: Not all languages support all Filter types. Results are displayed dynamically based on the language selected. |
| Custom Toxic Words | Optional. Enter a comma-separated list of words that will automatically mark an entry as toxic when present. |
| Action for Toxic Entries | Select what you’d like to happen when entries are marked toxic. |

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Send to toxic box | This will create a new category on the [Entries list page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entries/), where filtered entries will be sent (screenshot A). |
| Delete the entry | This will result in the entry being quietly discarded. There will be no record of this entry. |

## Using Toxicity Score Threshold in Conditional Logic

When setting up a conditional logic rule based on the Toxicity Score Threshold, **ensure that a leading zero is included**. For example, in the scenario below, conditional logic is applied to trigger a Notification when the Toxicity Score Threshold is greater than 0.5.
