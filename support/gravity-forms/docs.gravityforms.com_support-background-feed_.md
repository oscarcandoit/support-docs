# Add-On Support for Background Feed Processing

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/support-background-feed/#introduction)
- [Official Add-Ons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/support-background-feed/#add-ons)
- [Notes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/support-background-feed/#notes)

## Introduction

Background or async feed processing is a method that can be used to improve form submission performance.

It does this by moving feed processing to a separate request, which doesn’t block form submission completion, so the form submitter can see the confirmation faster than if they had to wait for the feeds to be processed.

### Notes

(1) The Dropbox Add-On uses an earlier implementation of background feed processing, so the files are already sent to Dropbox in a separate request that occurs after the submission has completed.

(2) The HubSpot Add-On requires Gravity Forms 2.7.1 or greater to use background feed processing.

(3) Background feed processing can’t be used with the User Registration Add-On when the user is to be logged in automatically by custom code or the [Auto Login](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-auto-login/) perk from certified developer Gravity Wiz. Use the `gform_is_feed_asynchronous` filter to disable it.

(4) Background feed processing for the User Registration Add-On requires Gravity Forms 2.7.1 or greater.

## Certified Add-Ons

Below, you will find a list of feed-based add-ons from [Certified Developers](https://www.gravityforms.com/certified-developers-and-add-ons/) that are known to support or do not support background processing.

| [Google Sheets](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-google-sheets/) | Gravity Wiz | Yes | Yes |
| [Legal Signing](https://cosmicgiant.com/plugins/legal-signing/) | CosmicGiant | No | No |
| [Limit Submissions](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-limit-submissions/) | Gravity Wiz | No | No |
| [OpenAI](https://gravitywiz.com/gravity-forms-openai/) | Gravity Wiz | No | No |

## Enabling Background Feed Processing

We are gradually releasing updates to enable background feed processing for add-ons that support it.

If you’d rather not wait for an update to be released, you can [update manually](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-manually-update/) using the zip available from the [downloads](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/downloads/) page, or the [gform\_is\_feed\_asynchronous filter](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_is_feed_asynchronous/) can be used to enable it.

The filter can also be used to enable it for third-party add-ons that extend the `GFFeedAddOn` class.

If you’d prefer a third-party add-on used background feed processing by default, please contact the developer and ask if they can set the [`$_async_feed_processing`](https://docs.gravityforms.com/_async_feed_processing/) property, in their class that extends `GFFeedAddOn`, to `true`.

Background feed processing might not be suitable for all add-ons. For example, if the add-on relies on submission time hooks or needs to make data available to the confirmation.
