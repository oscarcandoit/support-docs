## License Renewals

### How do I renew my license?

See [this article on renewals](https://docs.gravityforms.com/renewing-your-license/), or this article regarding [cancelling automatic renewals](https://docs.gravityforms.com/cancel-auto-renewals/).

### What happens if my license expires?

See [this article on expiring licenses](https://docs.gravityforms.com/license-expiry/).

### Why won’t my credit card go through?

If you’re not able to renew your license due to a transaction error, [please contact support](https://www.gravityforms.com/contact-us/) and be sure to provide the complete error message.

## License Upgrades

See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/upgrading-your-license/), or [this one for legacy licenses.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/legacy-license-faq/)

## License Transfers

See [this article on transferring your license](https://docs.gravityforms.com/transferring-your-license/) to another account.

## License Payments, Cancellations & Refunds

Refer to these articles for information on [purchases](https://docs.gravityforms.com/purchasing-a-gravity-forms-license/), [cancellations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/cancel-auto-renewals/), and [refunds](https://docs.gravityforms.com/obtaining-a-refund-for-your-license/).

### How do I update or change my payment method or my account profile details?

Follow the instructions in [this article on payment methods](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-payment-method/), or [this one about profile changes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-profile/).

## License Keys

### Will changing the license key on my website affect my forms or entries?

- You can change the license key on your website without affecting the forms, feeds, entries, or settings. No entries or forms are deleted when you change the license key on the Forms → Settings page. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/finding-your-license-key/#h-where-do-i-enter-my-license-key).
- If your old license key was expired, you may find that updates are required after adding your new license key.
- If your new license key does not support the Gravity Forms add-ons you have installed, updates for those unsupported add-ons will not be available to you, and you will be unable to obtain support from us.

### How do I find my license key(s)?

See this article on [finding and entering your license](https://docs.gravityforms.com/finding-your-license-key/).

### How do I use my license key?

Refer to the [entering your license article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/finding-your-license-key/) for details.

### Can I see which sites are associated with my license?

This is available within the license section of your account. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/find-sites-using-license-key/).

### Can I exclude a site from using my Gravity Forms key?

Yes. This is called revoking a site, and can be done if the site has already been registered to that key. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/find-sites-using-license-key/#revoked-sites) for more information.

### Can I restore a license that I revoked?

Yes. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/find-sites-using-license-key/#restoring-a-revoked-license) for more information.
