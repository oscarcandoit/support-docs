## Description

In addition to setting up multiple payment add-ons on a single form (see [Setting Up Conditional Payments](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-conditional-payments/)), you can also configure **conditional feeds** to handle different workflows depending on whether the user chooses an **online** (credit card) or **offline** (e.g., check, cash, wire transfer) payment method.

This allows you to customize:

| Behavior | Conditional Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **Which payment feed runs** | Only the feed matching the selected payment method (e.g., Stripe for Credit Card, none for offline) |
| **What confirmation message is displayed** | Different confirmations based on the selected method (e.g., receipt vs. mailing instructions) |
| **What notification is sent** | Custom notifications depending on payment method (e.g., admin alert for check, receipt for card) |
| **What content is shown using conditional shortcodes** | Dynamic content displayed post-submission based on user’s selection |

## Step 1: Add a Payment Method Selection Field

Start by adding a **Multiple Choice** or **Dropdown** field to your form labeled “Payment Method.” Example choices might be:

- Credit Card
- Pay by Check

**Note**: Set this field as **required** to ensure a selection is made.

[![Image showing Multiple Choice settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-14-1024x669.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-14.png)

## Step 2: Set Up Conditional Logic on Payment Feeds

### Credit Card Payment (Online)

If you’re using a payment add-on. We will be using [Stripe](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-add-on/).

1. Go to **Form Settings > Stripe**.
2. Create a feed for **Stripe**.
3. Enable **Conditional Logic**.
4. Set the condition > “Process this feed if Payment Method is **Credit Card**“

![Image showing Conditional Logic settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-15-1024x376.png)

### Offline Payment

Offline payments don’t use a payment add-on, but you may still want to trigger another feed. We will use a custom **[Notification](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/getting-started/notifications-getting-started/)** and **[Confirmation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/getting-started/confirmations-getting-started/)** in this example.

1. Go to the feed for your other action (e.g., a generic notification or custom post creation).
2. Enable **Conditional Logic**.
3. Set the condition > “Process this feed if Payment Method is **Pay by Check**“

![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-17-1024x315.png)![Image showing Notification content](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-16-1024x750.png)

## Step 3: Use Conditional Logic on the Stripe Field

Hide or show the **Stripe** field depending on the payment method.

1. Click the **Stripe** field in the form editor.
2. Under **Conditional Logic**, choose > “Show this field if Payment Method is **Credit Card**“

![Image showing Stripe field Conditional Logic settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-18-1024x493.png)

**Note**: This prevents users from seeing or completing the credit card field when paying offline.

## Step 4: Customize Confirmations Based on Payment Method

Set up multiple confirmation messages to match the selected payment method:

- **Default Confirmation (Offline)**: “Please send a check to: 123 Any Street, City, ST 00000.”. This is the Default Confirmation.
- **Stripe Confirmation (Online)**: “Thank you for your payment.” > Conditional Logic: Payment Method is **Credit Card**.
