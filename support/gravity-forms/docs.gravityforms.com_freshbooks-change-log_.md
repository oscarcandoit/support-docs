- Added note to entry upon successful invoice/estimate creation.
- Added merge tag support to the client & invoice/estimate Notes.

_// do stuff with the $args_
_return $args;_
_}, 10, 3 );_

- Updated "Update existing client" option to filter by email to improve performance.
- Updated POT file.
- Updated to send Item Name instead of Item ID when using Fixed Costs or Dynamic Fields. To continue sending the Item Id, use the hook:
