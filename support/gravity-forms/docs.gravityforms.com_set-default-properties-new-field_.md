## Introduction

Historically it’s been possible to set the default properties for a new field by using the [gform\_editor\_js\_set\_default\_values](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_editor_js_set_default_values) hook to echo a custom case into the switch statement within the SetDefaultValues() function in js.php, however, it’s also been possible to define your own SetDefaultValues\_{$type} function instead. In this article we will show how you can use that function in your new field which extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class.

## The SetDefaultValues\_{$type} function

Here’s what a basic SetDefaultValues\_ function would look like, the function name ends with your field type, in this case the field type is simple. The function is passed the field object so you can set the default values of any of the properties, in this case we are setting the field label.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3 | `function``SetDefaultValues_simple(field) {`<br>```field.label =``'The Default Field Label Goes Here'``;`<br>`}` |

See the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) article for the standard field properties.

## Using get\_form\_editor\_inline\_script\_on\_page\_render()

The [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class includes the get\_form\_editor\_inline\_script\_on\_page\_render() method which can be used to include scripts in the form editor. In this example we are assigning the value returned by the get\_form\_editor\_field\_title() method as the default label for new fields of this type.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `public``function``get_form_editor_inline_script_on_page_render() {`<br>```// set the default field label for the field`<br>```$script``= sprintf(``"function SetDefaultValues_%s(field) {field.label = '%s';}"``,``$this``->type,``$this``->get_form_editor_field_title() ) . PHP_EOL;`<br>```return``$script``;`<br>`}` |

## Setting the default Choices

You can use the Choice() function when defining the fields default choices.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `new``Choice(text, value, price)` |

The value and price properties are optional, if a value is not specified the text will be assigned to the choice value.

Here’s an example showing how that can be used with the SetDefaultValues\_ function.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4 | `function``SetDefaultValues_simple(field) {`<br>```field.label =``'The Default Field Label Goes Here'``;`<br>```field.choices = [``new``Choice(``'Your First Choice'``),``new``Choice(``'Your Second Choice'``),``new``Choice(``'Your Third Choice'``)];`<br>`}` |

## Setting the default Inputs

You can use the Input() function when defining the fields default inputs.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `new``Input(id, label)` |

The id is a string in the format {field\_id}.{input\_number}, starting with the input\_number of 1. For example, the first input of field 5 would be 5.1. We also recommend skipping ids ending in zero, so you would skip 5.10, 5.20 etc.

Here’s an example showing how that can be used with the SetDefaultValues\_ function.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4 | `function``SetDefaultValues_simple(field) {`<br>```field.label =``'The Default Field Label Goes Here'``;`<br>```field.inputs = [``new``Input(field.id +``'.1'``,``'Your First Choice'``),``new``Input(field.id +``'.2'``,``'Your Second Choice'``),``new``Input(field.id +``'.3'``,``'Your Third Choice'``)];`<br>`}` |
