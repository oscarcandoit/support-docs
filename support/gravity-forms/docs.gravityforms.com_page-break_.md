## Summary

The **Page** field allows the creation of multi-page forms. The Page field is available under the Standard Fields section within the field library sidebar of the form builder.

Adding a Page field will automatically add three new markers to your form:

1. a **Start Paging** marker at the top of your form.
2. a **Page Break** marker in the position you dragged to.
3. an **End Paging** marker at the bottom of your form.

Each one of these sections offer different settings, all of which are explained here.

## Common Settings

This field uses only common field settings for the Appearance and Advanced settings.

The Start Paging field will always appear at the top of your form (after a Page Break field is added to your form). This field is used to specify general options that define the behavior of your multi-page form.
