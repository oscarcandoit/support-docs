## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_HTML class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the HTML field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the html content`<br>`$content``=``$field``->content;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- [conditional\_logic\_field\_setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/advanced-field-settings/#conditional_logic_field_setting)
- [content\_setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/general-field-settings/#content_setting)
- [css\_class\_setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/appearance-field-settings/#css_class_setting)
- [disable\_margins\_setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/general-field-settings/#disable_margins_setting)
- [label\_setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/general-field-settings/#label_setting)

### Properties

Below is a listing of the properties inherited from the parent class and ones specific to the field.

- **conditionalLogic** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)
An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object) for more details.

- **content** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The HTML/text that displays for the field.

- **cssClass** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom CSS class or classes to be added to the input tag for the field.

- **disableMargins** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates whether the default margins are turned on to align the HTML content with other fields.

- **displayOnly** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates the field is only displayed and its contents are not submitted with the form/saved with the entry. This is set to true.

- **formId** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The form ID.

- **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The field ID.

- **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages.

- **type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field type. This is set to “html”.


## $entry Value

The HTML field is a display only field so does not save a value in the entry.

## Hooks

## Source Code
