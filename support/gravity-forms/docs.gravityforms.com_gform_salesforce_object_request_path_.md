## Description

The `gform_salesforce_object_request_path` filter allows developers to customize the request path used to fetch Salesforce Object Types in the feed creation dropdown for the Gravity Forms Salesforce Add-On, to limit or modify the displayed object types.

## Usage

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_salesforce_object_request_path'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 1);` |

## Parameters

- **$object\_request\_path** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string/)

The object name that’ll be passed to query the Object Type dropdown.

## Examples

### Appends An Object To The Request Path

This example appends Test\_Object\_\_c to the request path used to fetch Salesforce object types. This limits the dropdown to display only the specified object type (Test\_Object\_\_c). The object is obtained from the [Salesforce **Object Manager > API Name**](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.c360_a_source_object_name_and_object_api_name.htm&language=en_US&type=5) column.
