- [Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_select/#h-settings)

## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_Select class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Drop Down field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission. This class also handles the rendering of the Product, Product Option, Quantity, Shipping fields when they are a drop down.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the admin label`<br>`$admin_label``=``$field``->adminLabel;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **admin\_label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Admin Field Label” setting appears.

- **choices\_setting**


Determines whether the “Choices” setting displays. This section allows you to create different drop down selections and set associated values to each one. It also allows you to choose from a pre-defined set of data that may be used to create the items in the drop down. Without this section, the drop down selections are limited to “First Choice”, “Second Choice” and “Third Choice” and may not be changed in the editor.

- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.

- **css\_class\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom CSS Class” setting displays. This allows a custom css to be used for the field.

- **default\_value\_setting**


Controls whether the “Default Values” section displays. This allows a value to be set for the field.

- **description\_setting**


Controls whether the “Description” setting appears. This allows a description for the field to be displayed.

- **duplicate\_setting**


Controls whether the “No Duplicates” setting displays within the “Rules” section. This controls whether the same value may exist more than once in the database. The “Rules” setting must be active for this to display.

- **enable\_enhanced\_ui\_setting**


Determines whether the “Enable enhanced user interface” setting displays. This setting allows the Chosen jquery script to be used to add search capability to the drop down.

- **error\_message\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom Validation Message” setting which allows a custom message to be used appears.

- **label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.

- **placeholder\_setting**


Controls whether the “Placeholders” section appears. This allows placeholder text to display for the field.

- **prepopulate\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Allow field to be populated dynamically” setting appears.

- **rules\_setting**


Controls whether the “Rules” settings section displays. The “Required” option shows when this is active.

- **size\_setting**


Controls whether the “Field Size” setting displays. This controls the size of the input field for fields to which it applies. The sizes are “small”, “medium”, and “large”.

- **visibility\_setting**


Controls whether the “Visibility” setting displays. The controls whether the option of visibility being for “Everyone” or “Admin Only” can be set.
