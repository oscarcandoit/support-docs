## Description

The filter allows disabling the DOM parser, which **controls the output of the gform variable in the page header**. It is useful for environments where performance is a priority, and the DOM parser is unnecessary.

Depending on the form features and add-ons in use, **if the gform variable isn’t output in the header, there can be JavaScript errors, leading to malfunction of some form features and/or add-ons**.

Therefore, **using this filter is only recommended for advanced users** who understand the implications of disabling the DOM parser.

## Usage

Applies to all forms:

```

```

## Parameters

Defaults to false. Set to true using the WordPress \_\_return\_true function or a custom function that returns true.

## Examples

### Disable DOM Parser

```
add_filter( 'gform_disable_dom_parser', '__return_true' );
```

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.

See also the PHP section in this article: [Where Do I Put This Code?](https://docs.gravityforms.com/where-do-i-put-this-code/)

## Source Code

This filter is located in includes/libraries/class-dom-parser.php

## Since

The filter was added in Gravity Forms 2.9.1
