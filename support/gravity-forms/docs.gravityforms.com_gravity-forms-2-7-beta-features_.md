## Summary

This article lists some of the key features you will most likely notice immediately when checking out the brand new Gravity Forms 2.7.

For an up-to-date list of all features, refer to the [Gravity Forms official change log](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravityforms-change-log/).

It is worth noting that a lot of the effort this release is _under-the-hood_, setting up frameworks and developer-facing improvements and changes that will reap benefits for customers and developers as we move forward.

## Major Features

### Setup Wizard

Gravity Forms will now guide you through the biggest steps that are required after installation, to quickly get your license key entered and activated, and lead you quickly into the form template browser.

More information: [Gravity Forms Setup Wizard](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-setup-wizard/)

### Form Template Browser

Our pre-made form templates (as also provided [on our website](https://www.gravityforms.com/form-templates/) previously) are now offered directly within Gravity Forms when a new form creation process is initiated, allowing you to immediately start with a complete form just needing modifications for your particular requirements.

These templates have been updated and polished, and are supported by a help guide on our documentation site where needed.

If you have additional ideas for template ideas or feedback ops how to improve the base templates provided, you can make those suggestion on our product roadmap.

### Gravity Forms Block Themes and Style Settings

With 2.7, we have completely reworked the frameworks and underpinnings that control form styling and appearance. If you are using the [Gravity Forms Block](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-a-form-using-blocks/) to add Gravity Forms to your page or post, then when in the form editor, you will see a new **Block setting** that allows you to set the form theme to our new **Orbital** theme. Once Orbital is chosen, then you open up panels of settings that can be used to manipulate a number of appearance settings for your entire form. Refer to this document for more details.

For this initial beta, form settings must be set on a per form basis only, and are not persistent if you switch back to the default (pre-2.7) theme.

Form Appearance Settings have a limited selection of options for now. but this is an area we expect to be the focus of a lot of future improvements.

More information: [Block Themes and Style Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/block-themes-and-style-settings/)

### Enhanced Honeypot Method and Settings

Our existing anti-spam honeypot measures have been enhanced with a new Javascript based method, and a new setting that allows you to now specify what you wish to happen to entries caught by the honeypot methods.

More information: [Enhancements to the Spam Honeypot](https://docs.gravityforms.com/spam-honeypot-enhancements/)
