- [Usage](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_payment_methods/#h-usage)
- [Examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_payment_methods/#h-examples)

## Description

Use this filter to add alternative payment methods to the [Card field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/card-field/).

_Note that we recommend using the payment field specific to the payment type you are using, such as [Stripe Card Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-field/) or [PayPal Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-field/). The Card Field is intended as an option for payment methods where no integrated payment field is available._

## Usage

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_payment_methods'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 3 );` |

**$payment\_methods** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

Array containing other loaded payment methods.

**$field** [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object)

The current field.

**$form\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The ID of the current form.

## Examples

This example adds a payment method named Test Payment.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9 | `add_filter(``'gform_payment_methods'``,``'add_payment'``, 10, 3 );`<br>`function``add_payment(``$payment_methods``,``$field``,``$form_id``) {`<br>```$payment_methods``[] =``array``(`<br>```'key'``=>``'testing'``,`<br>```'label'``=>``'Test Payment'`<br>```);`<br>```return``$payment_methods``;`<br>`}` |

## Placement

This code should be placed in the [functions.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Functions_File) file of your active theme. If you are creating a plugin to integrate with Gravity Forms, this filter would go in your plugin file.

## Source Code

This filter is located in GF\_Field\_CreditCard::get\_field\_input() in _includes/fields/class-gf-field-creditcard.php_.
