- [Setup](https://docs.gravityforms.com/authorizing-trello-add/#h-setup)
- [Upgrading from Earlier Version](https://docs.gravityforms.com/authorizing-trello-add/#h-upgrading-from-earlier-version)
- [Re-Authenticating to Trello](https://docs.gravityforms.com/authorizing-trello-add/#h-re-authenticating-to-trello)

## Pre-Requisites

- [Download](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-a-gravity-forms-add-on) and [install](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/) the add-on
- A [Trello](https://trello.com/) account

## Setup

Before you can begin creating a feed for the Trello Add-On, you will first need to authorize it to access your Trello account.

Log into your WordPress Admin dashboard.

Go to **Forms > Settings > Trello**. You’ll be presented with a button to Authorize with Trello. **Click the button** to authenticate with your Trello account.

[![Gravity Forms Settings for Trello to Authorize with Trello account.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/authorize-with-trello.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/authorize-with-trello.png)

You will be presented with a notice advising you are being Redirected to Trello.

[![Dialogue advising you are being Redirected to Trello during Gravity Forms Trello Add-On authentication.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.29.44-PM.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-1.29.44-PM.png)

If you are not already logged into your Trello Account, you will be asked to login to Trello. **Login to Trello**.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/login-to-trello.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/login-to-trello.png)

Once you are logged into your Trello Account, the next dialogue asks you “Would you like to give the following application access to your account?”. This dialogue will include:

- Application Name: Gravity Forms
- Trello Account you are logged into and your User Name
- What permissions Gravity Forms is requesting to your Trello Account, and
- The boards and workspaces Gravity Forms will have access to.

[![Permissions screen at Trello asking for you to allow Gravity Forms to access your account.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/allow-gravity-forms-access-trello-419x1024.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/allow-gravity-forms-access-trello.png)

**Click Allow** to authorize Gravity Forms to access your account.

You will be redirected back to your website from Trello.

[![Redirecting you back to your website after authorizing Trello with Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/redirect-from-trello-gf.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/redirect-from-trello-gf.png)

You will now be returned to your Gravity Forms Trello Settings and will see a successful connection to Trello.

[![Authenticated with Trello in the Gravity Forms Trello Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/authenticated-with-trello.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/authenticated-with-trello.png)

Once you have authorized the Trello Add-On, you’re ready to begin [creating a feed for the Trello Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-feed-trello-add/).

## Upgrading from Earlier Version

If you are upgrading from a version of the Trello Add-On earlier than 2.0, you’ll need to re-authenticate to Trello. _This will not impact any of your existing feeds._

You will see a warning in your Gravity Forms Admin screen: **Gravity Forms Trello requires re-authentication. Please disconnect and re-connect to continue using this add-on.**

[![Gravity Forms Admin Screen showing Trello Add-On Warning that you will need to deauthorize and re-connect to Trello.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-12.01.16-PM-1024x488.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-12.01.16-PM.png)

### Re-Authenticating to Trello

Go to **Forms > Settings > Trello** and click **De-Authorize Trello**.

[![Gravity Forms Trello Add-On De-Authorize Trello button](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/de-authorize-trello-gravity-forms.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/de-authorize-trello-gravity-forms.png)

After clicking, you’ll receive the **Settings Updated** notice and the button will change to **Click here to Authenticate your Trello Account**. Continue with the steps above to Authenticate your Trello account.

[![After de-authorizing Trello, the Settings Updated notice is displayed along with a button change to Authorize with Trello.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/deauthorized-trello-gravity-forms-1-1024x276.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/deauthorized-trello-gravity-forms-1.png)
