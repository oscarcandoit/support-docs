# Entries

## Introduction to Entries

Setting up your form is only the means to an end. What you probably want most from that form are "submissions", or what Gravity Forms refers to as **an entry**. This section of our User Guide documentation covers all the basics of finding, reviewing and manipulating your entries.

## Where To Find Them

Gravity Forms collects all completed form submissions within your WordPress admin dashboard. You can access them by clicking or hovering over **Forms** in the left hand dashboard navigation ⓵, and then choosing **Entries** ⓶. See screenshot below.

From here you will be presented with a list of Entries. Check out [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entries/) for information on the layout and options for the Entries list page.

## Entry Details

Drilling down to an individual entry from an individual form allows you to review all fields, and manipulate the entry if required. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-detail/) for more on the entry detail page.

To manipulate or report on your entries outside of your Wordpress dashboard, you can export them from the entry database. Follow the steps in [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/exporting-form-entries/) for exporting entries.
