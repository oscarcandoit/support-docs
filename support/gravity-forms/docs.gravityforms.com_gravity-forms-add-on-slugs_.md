# Gravity Forms Add-On Slugs

- [Legacy Add-Ons](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-add-on-slugs/#h-legacy-add-ons)

The following slugs are used by the [Add-On Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework) based add-ons developed by Rocketgenius, Inc. The slugs are lowercase and prefixed **gravityforms** followed by the add-ons short title, omitting any spaces or special characters.

Some hooks may omit the gravityforms prefix when using the slug, such as the [gform\_short\_slug\_field\_value](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_short_slug_field_value) filter.
