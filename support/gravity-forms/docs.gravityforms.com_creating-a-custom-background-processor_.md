# Creating A Custom Background Processor

- [What Is A Background Processor](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-custom-background-processor/#h-what-is-a-background-processor)
- [Creating a Custom Background Processor](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-custom-background-processor/#h-creating-a-custom-background-processor)

Sending data to external services, generating reports, or performing complex calculations can pose a challenge when working with form submissions in real time. This guide will walk you through creating a custom background processor in Gravity Forms by extending the GF\_Background\_Process class.

## What Is A Background Processor

A **background processor** lets you offload time consuming processes to run in the background, ensuring that form submissions remain fast and responsive. This approach improves site performance and user experience while handling all necessary post-submission operations.

## Creating a Custom Background Processor

The example implementation covers the following:

- Automatically queuing tasks triggered by form submissions.
- Processing queued tasks asynchronously using custom logic.
- Managing scheduled events and queues during plugin uninstallation.
- Handling edge cases, such as skipped or invalid entries.

Let’s explore the code and learn how to implement this solution.
