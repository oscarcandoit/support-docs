# Creating A Brevo Feed

## Summary

To send information from your Gravity Forms form to the Brevo service, you will first need to create a [feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/what-is-a-feed/). The feed will tell Gravity Forms which Brevo List you want to use, how you want the fields to be mapped, and under what conditions you wish for the entry to be sent to the service.

This article describes the steps to create a basic feed for the Brevo Add-On.

## Create a Feed

To create a feed using the Brevo Add-On for Gravity Forms, do the following from your WordPress Admin Dashboard:

1. Click on **Forms** in the left side menu.
2. Select the form that you want to use with Brevo.
3. Once within your desired form, hover over **Form Settings** and click on **Brevo**.
4. Click **Add New** to create a new feed. You will be presented with the Brevo feed settings screen.

## Feed Settings Reference

[![Image Showing Brevo Feed Settings Reference](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-8-1024x558.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-8.png)[![Image showing Double Opt-In Settings for the Brevo feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-9-1024x437.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-9.png)

This table describes the feed settings options you will be offered for a Brevo feed.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Feed Name** | Enter a feed name to identify this setup uniquely. _**Required**._ |
| **Brevo List** | Select the Brevo List you would like to add your contacts to. |
| **Email** | Select an Email field in the form that will be mapped to Brevo. **Required**. |
| **{attributes}** | Save information from form entries to Brevo attributes by selecting the appropriate fields from the dropdown list**1**.<br>Refer to [this](https://help.brevo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10617359589906-Create-and-manage-contact-attributes) article for more information about managing attributes in Brevo. |
| **Enable Double Opt-In** | The Brevo email template to use for double opt-in. **Required** |
| **Redirect URL** | The URL the contact is redirected to when they click the link in the double opt-in email. **Required** |
| **Bulk Add / Conditional Logic Choices** | If unchecked, every successful form submission will be sent to Brevo. If you wish to set specific conditions for sending form data to Brevo, check the “Enable Condition” box and fill out the required criteria. |

### Notes

1. Note that you cannot map a Gravity Forms field to the Boolean type Brevo field directly. However, you can map a single checkbox choice to other Brevo field types such as Text. If you need to map to a Boolean type Brevo field, the [gform\_{$SHORT\_SLUG}\_field\_value](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_short_slug_field_value/) filter can be used to evaluate the value submitted in the form, then send `true` or `false` to Brevo.
