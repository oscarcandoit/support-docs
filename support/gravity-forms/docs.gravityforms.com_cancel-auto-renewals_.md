## Introduction

With the exception of some legacy licenses, all subscriptions will automatically renew; there is no way to renew a license manually.

If a subscription is canceled, licenses contained in that subscription will still be valid for downloads and support **until the listed expiration date**. On the expiration date, you will cease to be able to download any of the related products, and you will no longer receive access to Gravity Forms Support. If you would like to continue using Gravity Forms after your license expires, you will need to purchase a new license and change any existing sites to the new license key.

❗Warning: **An expired license cannot be renewed or upgraded**.

## How do I cancel the auto-renewal?

To cancel renewals on the subscription attached to your license, do the following:

1. [Log in](https://gravity.com/) to your [Gravity account](https://docs.gravityforms.com/updating-your-profile/) page. Go to **Licenses** and click **Manage Subscription Request Refund button in the Manage Subscription**.
2. On the **Manage Subscription** page, you can see when your subscription renews in the **Next Payment** field. To stop re-billing on that future date, click the **Cancel Future Renewals** button.

3. Read the message presented on the next screen. If agreed, click the **Confirm Cancel Future Renewals** button.

**Note:** Canceling a subscription cancels renewals for _all licenses_ contained within that subscription.

A successful cancel will be greeted by a browser message.

## Restarting a canceled subscription

You can **restart renewals on a canceled subscription** if you change your mind before the license expiry date.

1. Go to your License list and find the “ **Restart Subscription**” button.

2. Click the **Confirm Restart** button.

Note: This option will only appear if your license is valid for restart, meaning:

- Your license has not expired. If your license has passed it’s expiry date, you will need to [purchase a new license](https://gravityforms.com/pricing). [Contact support](https://gravityforms.com/support) for additional help.
- **AND** the license you are attempting to restart was previously under a subscription. This option may not show for some license types, such as limited “giveaways”, “starter licenses” or deprecated legacy license types.

A successful restart will be greeted by a browser message. This will **restart all licenses** that were previously included in that subscription with the same payment method and renewal dates as the subscription had before.

If you run into an issue on restart, [contact our Support team](https://www.gravityforms.com/open-support-ticket/).
