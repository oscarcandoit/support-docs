[**Accessing Mapped Field Values During Feed Processing** \\
These functions are located in the GFAddOn class and can be used to retrieve the mapped form field values during feed processing in the process\_feed() method.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/mapped-field-values-during-feed-processing/ "Accessing Mapped Field Values During Feed Processing") [**Add Sub-Pages to Gravity Forms Admin Navigation** \\
If you want to add a page to the Gravity Forms Admin navigation options, add the following code to your theme’s functions.php file.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/add-sub-pages-to-gravity-forms-admin-nav/ "Add Sub-Pages to Gravity Forms Admin Navigation") [**Adding a New Notification Service Using the Add-On Framework** \\
Since Gravity Forms 1.9.16, developers can now include new services which can be selected by the user to handle sending the form notifications.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/new-notification-service-using-framework/ "Adding a New Notification Service Using the Add-On Framework") [**Adding a Note to the Entry when Using the Add-On Framework** \\
