## Introduction

The official Gravity Forms Akismet Add-On provides a way to integrate your form with the Akismet service, allowing you to use that service to help identify suspicious or likely spam entries.

## Description

Akismet is a spam filtering service for WordPress websites. It catches blog comments and pingback spam using its algorithm and a broad collection of data from thousands of sources.

This algorithm learns from previous data and the actions taken by participating websites. For example, when many websites start reporting similar content as spam, Akismet will learn to identify this type of content as spam.

**Note**: Refer to [this](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-anti-spam/) article for more information about the legacy integration.

## Setup Akismet

Refer to the [Akismet Settings Reference](https://docs.gravityforms.com/akismet-settings-reference/) article for a complete list of add-on settings, and the [Setting Up The Akismet Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-akismet-add-on/) for the process steps required to get up and running.

## Marked As Spam

When Akismet marks an entry as spam, it can still be found on the entries page, but it will be placed in the **Spam** category instead of **Unread**.

[![Screen Shot of Entry list page with option to mark spam](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-8-1024x301.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-8.png)

When you manually mark an entry as spam (by clicking the red Spam link as shown in the screenshot above) it will help train Akismet for similar entries moving forward. Akismet will use this information to improve its spam filtering process on your installation and across all websites.

[This help guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/reviewing-spam-submissions/) shows how to mark entries as spam.

## Testing Akismet Forms

- Akismet will process entries submitted from a _form preview_ in test mode, which prevents those submissions from training the Akismet filters.
- Embedded forms submitted by logged-in users will send the user role to Akismet. Akismet does not mark submissions by administrators as spam.

## Akismet Hooks

The Akismet Add-On includes two filters that can be used to customize the Akismet integration:

- [gform\_akismet\_enabled](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_akismet_enabled/), which can be used to enable or disable global integration or specific forms.
- [gform\_akismet\_fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_akismet_fields/) can be used to modify the data sent to Akismet.

- X/Twitter


This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
