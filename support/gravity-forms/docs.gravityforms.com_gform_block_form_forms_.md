## Description

The `gform_block_form_forms` filter allows the list of available forms displayed in the Form block to be overridden.

## Usage

The filter would be used like so:

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_block_form_forms'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

## Parameters

- **$forms** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

A collection of active forms on site. The array for each form contains the following properties: id, title, and hasConditionalLogic. As of Gravity Forms 2.5, this array is sorted alphabetically by title. It was previously sorted incrementally by id.

## Examples

### 1\. Remove

This example removes form id 1 from the list of forms which can be embedded using the Form block in the WordPress block editor.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_block_form_forms'``,``function``(``$forms``) {`<br>```foreach``(``$forms``as``$key``=>``$form``) {`<br>```if``(``$form``[``'id'``] == 1 ) {`<br>```unset(``$forms``[``$key``] );`<br>```break``;`<br>```}`<br>```}`<br>``<br>```return``array_values``(``$forms``);`<br>`} );` |

### 2\. Sort list newest to oldest

This example sorts the list of forms with most recent forms listed at the the top. _(requires PHP 7 or greater)_

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_block_form_forms'``,``function``(``$forms``) {`<br>```usort(``$forms``,``function``(``$a``,``$b``) {`<br>```return``$b``[``'id'``] <=>``$a``[``'id'``];`<br>```});`<br>```return``$forms``;`<br>`} );` |

## Placement

This code should be placed in the [functions.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Functions_File) file of your active theme or a custom functions plugin.

## Since

This filter was added in Gravity Forms v2.4.22.5.

## Source Code

This filter is located in _GF\_Block\_Form::get\_forms()_ in _includes/blocks/class-gf-block-form.php_.
