# Confirmations Object

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmations-object/#introduction)
- [Usage](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmations-object/#usage)
- [Confirmation Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/confirmations-object/#confirmation-properties)

## Introduction

The Confirmations object is an associative array containing the properties for all the confirmations which exist for a form. When a new form is created a single confirmation, named Default Confirmation, is created. There is no limit to the number of additional confirmations you can create but they must have conditional logic configured.

See the [Configuring Confirmations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-confirmations/) article for a tutorial showing how you can configure confirmations in the admin.

|     |
| --- |
| `$form``[``'confirmations'``] =``array``(`<br>```'5acf8e9cf310a'``=>``array``(`<br>```'id'``=>``'5acf8e9cf310a'``,`<br>```'name'``=>``'Default Confirmation'``,`<br>```'isDefault'``=> true,`<br>```'type'``=>``'message'``,`<br>```'message'``=>``'Thanks for contacting us! We will get in touch with you shortly.'``,`<br>```'url'``=>``''``,`<br>```'pageId'``=>``''``,`<br>```'queryString'``=>``''``,`<br>```),`<br>`);` |

## Usage

The confirmations are part of the [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object) and so are most commonly accessed like so:

|     |
| --- |
| `$confirmations``= rgar(``$form``,``'confirmations'``);` |
