## Pre-Requisites

- Gravity Forms and [Gravity Forms Stripe Add-On installed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/installing-a-gravity-forms-add-on/)
- SSL Certificate Installed and Configured
- A [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account
- A Stripe account login with [user role](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard/teams#user-roles) of “owner” or “administrator”

## Stripe Settings

The Stripe Settings allow you to connect and authenticate with your Stripe account, as well as make choices about how you collect payment information. Additionally, this screen allows you to set up webhooks, which are used to communicate events from Stripe back to your Gravity Forms environment.

Navigate to your Stripe Add-On Settings page:

1. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
3. Click the **Stripe** tab.

[![Stripe Settings for Gravity Forms under Forms > Settings > Stripe showing the Live or Test Mode connection and Webhook configuration along with Payment Collection configuration.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-settings-general-1024x992.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-settings-general.png)

### Mode

Mode specifies the environment to which you want to connect your form submissions. Choosing **Live** will connect to the environment that initiates real transactions against your Stripe account. Choosing **Test** will run the form entry into your Stripe test environment for review, but no actual charges will occur.

Review the process described in [this help guide for full instructions on connecting to a live or test environment.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/connecting-to-stripe-in-live-or-test-mode/)

### Webhooks

**You are required to have Webhooks enabled** in your Live environment (and Test environment if you are using it). Stripe communicates with your website throughout the transactional process of collecting payments and creating subscriptions, and it uses the Webhook endpoints you create to listen to the transactional events from Stripe. The filter [gform\_stripe\_webhook](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_webhook/) defines what events are listened for by the Stripe Add-on and how to add support for listening to additional events from Stripe.

Use the instructions below to complete the **Live Signing Secret** and **Test Signing Secret** and confirm that Webhooks are enabled in the Stripe Settings screen. The View Webhooks Instructions links to this document and provides the Endpoint URL from your website. The Mode you select (Live or Test) will determine which webhook you are configuring and whether you are creating a **Test Signing Secret** or a **Live Signing Secret**.

[![Webhook configuration settings for Stripe Add-on](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-connected-webhook-settings.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-connected-webhook-settings.png)

#### Quick Start for Adding Webhooks

Do you already know what you’re doing? Here’s the quick links to Add Viewpoints in Live and in Test along with links to view all Endpoints in Live and Test. Remember when you collect the Signing Secret from Stripe the LIVE Stripe account provides Live Signing Secrets; the TEST provides Test Signing Secret.

| Quick Links | Live Mode | Test Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add Webhook Endpoint | [Add Webhook in Live](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks/create) | [Add Webhook in Test](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks/create) |
| All Webhook Endpoints | [View Endpoints in Live](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks) | [View Endpoints in Test](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks) |

#### Creating a Webhook Endpoint in Live

Log in to your [Stripe account Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks/create) and select the **Create an event destination** option:

[![Stripe Webhook Select Events](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-webhooks-select-events-1024x766.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-webhooks-select-events.png)

Under **Select Events**, Your account will be selected as the default:

1. For **Events from** select _Your account_, which is the default choice.
2. For **API Version**, select _the latest API version_.
3. For **Events**, you have the option to select specific events or all events. Click the checkbox to **Select all**.

You will receive a warning that “Selecting all events may increase latency and cause poor performance.” We recommend “selecting all” because Stripe often updates or changes their webhook events, which may result in specific selections that worked previously no longer effectively communicating with the Stripe Add-On. If you choose not to “select all”, we recommend you review the performance in a sandbox environment regularly, and at least with each update.

[![Image showing Stripe selected events with warning.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-select-events-warning-1024x572.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-select-events-warning.png)

You can also select individual events in this list, but at a minimum, you must select all the events from the [gform\_stripe\_webhooks](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_webhook/) article. This list is subject to change.

Click **Continue** to confirm Event selection.

Under **Choose destination type**, select **Webhook endpoint** and click **Continue**.

[![Image showing Stripe Payload screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-1024x729.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2.png)

Under **Configure your destination**, click **Continue** at the Payload Style Notice.

[![Image showing Stripe payload styles screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3-1024x739.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png)

**Add your Endpoint URL** to the Snapshot Payload and Thin Payload configuration screens.

The Endpoint URL for your website will be provided under the **View Webhooks instructions** under the Stripe Settings screen. There is a useful button for **Copy URL** which will copy the Endpoint URL to your clipboard so it can be easily pasted into the screens at Stripe.

![Endpoint URL and Copy URL from the Stripe Settings screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-copy-webhook-endpoint.png)

**Note**: In versions of Stripe prior to 6.0, the link to the Endpoint URL was included in the View Webhooks Instructions modal.

The Endpoint URL is determined by your website url, i.e **https://your\_website.com/**, followed by **?callback=gravityformsstripe**

As an example, if your website was **https://www.example.com**, you would use **https://www.example.com/?callback=gravityformsstripe**

Under **Snapshot payloads**, leave the **Destination name** at the default value and input the **Endpoint URL** and click **Continue**.

[![Image showing Stripe payloads screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4-1024x736.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png)

Under **Thin payloads**, leave the **Destination name** at the default value and input the **Endpoint URL** and click **Continue**.

[![Image showing Stripe Thin payloads screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5-1024x724.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png)

Under **Review and Finish**, confirm the settings for both destinations and click **Add Destination**.

[![Image showing the Signing secret for the Stripe Webhook](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-6-1024x724.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-6.png)

After clicking Add Destination, you will be provided a **Signing Secret** for both Payloads destinations. **Copy the Signing Secret** using the clipboard icon on this confirmation screen

Click **Done** at the confirmation screen, ignoring the Signing Secret from the Thin payload as _this is not used by Gravity Forms at this time_.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-7-1024x907.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-7.png)

Paste the **Signing Secret** from the Stripe Webhooks page into the Stripe settings. As you are configuring the **Live** webhook in this section, paste the Signing Secret from Stripe into the **Live Signing Secret** field.

Follow the process below for Creating a Webhook Endpoint in Test to complete the Test Signing Secret if you are using your Test environment in Stripe.

#### Creating a Webhook Endpoint in Test

Log into your [Stripe account Test Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks/create) and select **Create an event destination**:

[![Stripe screen for Creating an event destination in Test Mode.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-test-webhook-create-destination-1024x922.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-test-webhook-create-destination.png)

You will know you are configuring a Test Webhook by the ‘ **Test Mode**‘ banner at the top of the screen.

Much of this process mirrors the Live configuration above, except you will not have to configure two payload types. We’re repeating the steps to note the differences.

Under **Select Events**, Your account will be selected by default:

1. For **Events from** select _Your account_ which will be selected by default.
2. For **API Version**, select _the latest API version_.
3. For **Events**, you have the option to select specific events or all events. Click the checkbox to **Select all**.

You will receive a warning that “Selecting all events may increase latency and cause poor performance.” You can ignore this notice. You can also select individual events in this list, but at a minimum you must select all the events from the [gform\_stripe\_webhooks](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_webhook/) article. This list is subject to change.

Click **Continue** to confirm Event selection.

Under **Choose destination type**, select **Webhook endpoint** and click **Continue**.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/02-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Destination-Type-1024x587.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/02-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Destination-Type.png)

Under **Configure your destination**, add your **Endpoint URL** and click **Create Destination**.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Endpoint-URL-1024x594.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Endpoint-URL.png)

Just like above, the Endpoint URL for your website will be provided below the **View Webhooks Instructions** link under the Stripe Settings screen. There is a useful button for **Copy URL** which will copy the Endpoint URL to your clipboard so it can be easily pasted into the screens at Stripe.

[![Endpoint URL and Copy URL from the Stripe Settings screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-copy-webhook-endpoint.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/stripe-copy-webhook-endpoint.png)

**Note**: In versions of Stripe prior to 6.0, the link to the Endpoint URL was included in the View Webhooks Instructions modal.

The Endpoint URL is determined by your website url, i.e **https://your\_website.com/**, followed by **?callback=gravityformsstripe**

As an example, if your website was **https://www.example.com**, you would use **https://www.example.com/?callback=gravityformsstripe**

Under Event Destinations, Overview, you will receive the final screen for the Test Endpoint:

[![Test Stripe Endpoint Overview showing Signing Secret location in settings screen.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Test-Signing-Overview-1024x408.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Test-Signing-Overview.png)

You can reveal the **Test Signing Secret** by clicking the eye under **Signing Secret** in the above screen.

[![Copy Signing Secret under Webhooks Configuration in Stripe.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Test-Signing-Secret-1024x216.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-Test-Stripe-Webhooks-Test-Signing-Secret.png)

Once revealed, you can click the clipboard icon to Copy the Test Signing Secret to the Clipboard. The **Signing Secret** you receive at the end of this process goes into the **Test Signing Secret** under the Stripe Settings screen.

#### Confirming Webhooks are Enabled

Check the **I have enabled the Gravity Forms webhook URL in my Stripe account** box.

Click **Save Settings** at the bottom of the page.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-33.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-33.png)

### Payment Collection

This option was introduced in Stripe version 2.6. It is not shown on the Settings page for earlier versions.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stripe-5.0-Payment-Collection-Method-1024x310.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stripe-5.0-Payment-Collection-Method.png)

1. Scroll to the **Payment Collection** section.
2. Select the **Payment Collection Method** to determine how your form will obtain payment information. See [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-payment-collection-methods/) for more information on the payment collection methods offered.

Once you have entered your Stripe settings, you’re ready to begin [Setting Up a Stripe Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-stripe-compatible-form/).

## Notes

- There is a maximum limit of 16 webhook endpoints per Stripe account.
- Stripe Checkout can only be tested/used on a public site. If your site is not public, you won’t be able to see the Stripe Checkout page.
- The Stripe settings layout was modified in Stripe Add-On version 2.8. **For setting up older versions, [refer to this article.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-stripe-add-on-version-2-7-and-earlier/)**
