## Introduction

The Gravity Forms Block is available within the WordPress block editor and can be used to [insert a form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-a-form-using-blocks/) on a page or post. This article details the settings available for the Gravity Forms block once it has been inserted.

## Accessing the Block Settings

Within your page or post, make sure you have the entire Gravity Forms block selected from within the page editor. Make sure that the sidebar option is active in the top right corner of the editor, and then choose the _Block_ tab that is revealed.

This will reveal a long sidebar of settings sections which are detailed below.

## List of Block Settings

The various settings panels that are made available for the Gravity Forms block are detailed below. Note that when selecting a modern-style form theme like the provided Orbital theme you will get access to additional panels of style options. Refer to [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-themes-and-style-settings/) for more information on those styling options.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Preview** | Toggles whether the full form is shown within the editor block, or just a marker for it. |
| **AJAX** | Toggles embedding the form on the front-end using AJAX, allowing for confirmations and changing between form pages to happen without page reloads. |
| **Field Values** | Specifies the default field values in an ampersand (&) separated list. For example, to set default values for fields with the parameters “dropdown” and “email” you would use email=test@test.com&dropdown=First Choice. If the block preview is also enabled in the Advanced tab of the block settings you will see the default values update in real time in the editor while editing the page or post.<br>For more detailed information on how to dynamically populate a field please see our [documentation on dynamic population](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-dynamic-population/)). |
| **Tabindex** | Sets the tab index of the form element on the page. |
