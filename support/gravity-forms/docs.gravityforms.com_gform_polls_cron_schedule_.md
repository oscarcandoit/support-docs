## Description

Allows the frequency of the cron job that calculates poll data to be modified. The default schedule is set to hourly to avoid heavy loads on the server.

The wp\_cron job will take over the calculation of the results if 5 seconds is not long enough at the time of form submission/update.

Important: the Polls Add-On must be deactivated and reactivated in order to reschedule the task.

## Usage

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_polls_cron_schedule'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 1 );` |

## Parameters

- **$schedules** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)


An array of the current schedules.

## Examples

## Placement
