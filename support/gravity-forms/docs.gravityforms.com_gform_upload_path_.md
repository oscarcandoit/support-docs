## Description

This filter is executed before uploading a file (by the File Upload or Post Image fields). It can be used to change the location where uploaded files are stored.

## Usage

The following would apply to all forms.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_upload_path'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

To limit the scope of your function to a specific form, append the form id to the end of the hook name. (format: gform\_upload\_path\_FORMID)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_upload_path_5'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 2 );` |

## Parameters

- **$path\_info** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

The upload path to be filtered. It is an associative array with two keys which must be specified.




  - **$path\_info\[‘path’\]** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    Full physical path to upload folder.

  - **$path\_info\[‘url’\]** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    Full URL to upload folder.
- **$form\_id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The ID of the form currently being processed.

## Examples

### 1\. Log the current path

You can use this example when [logging is enabled](https://docs.gravityforms.com/logging-and-debugging/) to find out the current path before using the next example to change it.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `add_filter(``'gform_upload_path'``,``function``(``$path_info``,``$form_id``) {`<br>```GFCommon::log_debug(``"log_upload_path(): path_info for form #{$form_id} => "``. print_r(``$path_info``, true ) );`<br>```return``$path_info``;`<br>`}, 10, 2 );` |

### 2\. Change the path and URL

This example changes the upload path and URL for the File Upload field.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6 | `add_filter(``'gform_upload_path'``,``'change_upload_path'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``change_upload_path(``$path_info``,``$form_id``) {`<br>```$path_info``[``'path'``] =``'/home/public_html/yourdomainfolder/new/path/'``;`<br>```$path_info``[``'url'``] =``'http://yourdomainhere.com/new/path/'``;`<br>```return``$path_info``;`<br>`}` |

## Security Considerations

- The default secure “gf-download” links will only work with the default upload path. If you use this filter to modify the path, you cannot use the “gf-download” links, and the file will be directly accessible by filename and URL.
- Gravity Forms will create the necessary directories if they do not exist and the folder permissions allow it. When creating the folders, Gravity Forms will create an [empty index.html file](https://docs.gravityforms.com/security/#h-the-gravity-forms-uploads-folder) to prevent directory browsing and search engine indexing of uploaded files on poorly configured web servers. **If you create the folders yourself before using this filter**, be sure to disable directory browsing for the folders or place an empty `index.html` file in the directory to prevent directory browsing.

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.

## Source Code

This filter is located in GFFormsModel::get\_file\_upload\_path() in _forms\_model.php_.
