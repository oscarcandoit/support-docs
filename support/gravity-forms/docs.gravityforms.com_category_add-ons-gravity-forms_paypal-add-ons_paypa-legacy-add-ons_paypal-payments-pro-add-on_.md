# PayPal Payments Pro Add-On

PayPal has announced that from September 2024, certain [legacy APIs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/deprecated-resources/) they provide will stop receiving support and customers using them may experience a loss of functionality. If you are using any of our Gravity Forms legacy PayPal Add-Ons ( [PayPal Payments Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-pro-add-on/), [PayPal Payments Standard Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-payments-standard-add-on/), [PayPal Pro Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/paypal-add-ons/paypa-legacy-add-ons/paypal-pro-add-on/)), we recommend you evaluate the feasibility of migrating to the PayPal Checkout Add-On to avoid possible disruption of services.
