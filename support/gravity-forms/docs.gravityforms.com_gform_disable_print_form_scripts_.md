## Description

This filter can be used to prevent scripts and stylesheets being printed when GFCommon::gform\_do\_shortcode() processes form shortcodes located in various form settings and confirmations after headers have been sent. Scripts and stylesheets would be enqueued instead.

## Usage

The following would apply to all forms.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_disable_print_form_scripts'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

## Parameters

- **$disable\_print\_form\_script** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool)
Should printing of the scripts and stylesheets be disabled? _Default is false._

- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object)

The form object for the shortcode being processed.

- **$is\_ajax** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool)

Indicates if ajax was enabled on the shortcode.


## Examples

### 1\. Disable printing of scripts and stylesheets for all forms

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `add_filter(``'gform_disable_print_form_scripts'``,``'__return_true'``);` |

### 2\. Target a specific form

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8 | `add_filter(``'gform_disable_print_form_scripts'``,``'disable_print_form_scripts'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``disable_print_form_scripts(``$disable_print_form_script``,``$form``) {`<br>```if``(``$form``[``'id'``] == 10 ) {`<br>```return``true;`<br>```}`<br>```return``$gform_disable_print_form_scripts``;`<br>`}` |

## Placement

This code should be placed in the [functions.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Functions_File) file of your active theme.

## Since

This filter was added in Gravity Forms 2.0.

## Source Code

This filter is located in GFCommon::gform\_do\_shortcode() in _common.php_.
