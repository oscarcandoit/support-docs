## Description

The gform\_square\_authorization\_only filter allows authorization-only transactions by preventing the capture request from being made after the entry has been saved.

**Note:** Payments that are only authorized and not captured via your Square dashboard within 6 days will automatically expire.

## Usage

The hook, which would run for all Square product and service feed,s can be used like so:

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_square_authorization_only'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 5 );` |

## Parameters

- **$authorization\_only** [bool](https://docs.gravityforms.com/bool)
Defaults to false, return true to prevent payment being captured.

- **$feed** [Feed Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/feed-object)

The feed object currently being processed.

- **$submission\_data** [Submission Data](https://docs.gravityforms.com/submission-data)

The customer and transaction data.

- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object)

The form object currently being processed.

- **$entry** [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object)

The entry object currently being processed.


## Examples

### 1\. Apply to all product and service feeds

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_square_authorization_only'``,``'__return_true'``);` |

### 2\. Apply to a specific feed

The following example shows how you can delay the subscription cancellation for a specific feed by checking the feed name.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11 | `add_filter(``'gform_square_authorization_only'``,``'square_authorization_only'``, 10, 2 );`<br>`function``square_authorization_only(``$authorization_only``,``$feed``) {`<br>```$feed_name``= rgars(``$feed``,``'meta/feedName'``);`<br>```if``(``$feed_name``===``'your feed name here'``) {`<br>```return``true;`<br>```}`<br>```return``$authorization_only``;`<br>`}` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.
