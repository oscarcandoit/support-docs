## Introduction

You can apply conditional logic to **[survey fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/survey/)** such as **Likert**, **Rank** and **Rating**. This allows you to dynamically show or hide fields based on specific responses within these survey fields. This feature allows you to create more tailored user experiences, asking follow-up questions or triggering actions based on user inputs in survey fields.

**Note:** Conditional Logic for **Likert** and **Rank** fields requires Gravity Forms 2.8.1+ and Survey Add-On 4.0.0+

## Steps to Use Survey Fields in Conditional Logic

Let’s say you’re collecting feedback with a **Likert** scale. If a respondent selects “Strongly Disagree” in one of the fields, you can configure a follow-up question asking for more details. Similarly, in a **Rank** field, you can display additional fields if an option is ranked within the top three.

1. **Add Survey Fields to Your Form**. Add your desired **Likert**, **Rank**, or **Rating** field to your form.

Refer to this [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-the-survey-add-on/) for more information about adding Survey fields to your form.
2. **Enable Conditional Logic**. Select another field where you want to apply conditional logic.

Refer to this [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/enable-conditional-logic/) for more information about conditional logic.
3. **Now you can configure Conditional Logic Based on Survey Responses**.

#### **Likert Field**

You can now apply conditional logic to each **row** of a Likert field. For example, show a follow-up question if a user selects a specific option.

#### **Rank Field**

Set conditional logic based on the rank positions. For instance, you could show a field only if an item is ranked in position 1.

#### **Rating Field**

Showing another question based on the Rating set for a previous question.
