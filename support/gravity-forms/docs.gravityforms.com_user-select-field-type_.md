- [Example](https://docs.gravityforms.com/user-select-field-type/#h-example)

## Introduction

The **user\_select** type field, part of the [Settings API](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-api), allows the user to select a user object from a drop-down menu. When the setting loads, it lists the first 10 users on the website and offers an option for “Logged In User.”

## Example

This field will output a select field containing users.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7 | `array``(`<br>```'name'``=>``'user'``,`<br>```'label'``=> esc_html__(``'User'``,``'yournamespace'``),`<br>```'type'``=>``'user_select'``,`<br>```'required'``=> false,`<br>```'default_value'``=>``'logged-in-user'``,`<br>`),` |

## Filters

The filter `gform_user_select_query_params` allows to filter the parameters for the query for the initial list of users in the user select dropdown.

## Since

Added in Gravity Forms version 2.9.5
