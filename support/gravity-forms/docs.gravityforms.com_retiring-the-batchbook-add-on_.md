# Retiring The Batchbook Add-On

The Batchbook service has been shutdown, with all data and services being closed as of January 2019. With that in mind, as of November 2019 we have retired the official Gravity Forms Batchbook Add-On also.

This means that the plugin:

- can no longer be downloaded from our website or the add-on browser
- can no longer be supported by our customer service team.
- all user guides were removed from our [documentation site](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/batchbook-add-on/) in 2021.

If you have any further questions, please contact our [support team](https://www.gravityforms.com/support/).
