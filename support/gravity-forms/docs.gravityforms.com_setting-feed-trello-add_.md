## Summary

Before the Trello Add-On can be used with Gravity Forms, you will first need to create [a feed](https://docs.gravityforms.com/what-is-a-feed/). A feed simply allows form submission data to be sent to another source. In this instance, form data being sent to Trello.

## Create a Feed

To create a feed to Trello using the Trello Add-On for Gravity Forms, do the following from your WordPress Admin Dashboard:

1. Click on **Forms** in the left side menu.
2. Select the form that you want to use with Trello.
3. Once within your desired form, hover over **Settings** and click on **Trello**.
4. Click **Add New** to create a new feed. You will be presented with the Trello feed settings screen.

### Feed Settings Screen

The following fields are available within the settings screen. Refer to the settings screenshot below.

01. A **Feed Name** is required. It is only used for identification and will not be shown anywhere other than your feed listing.
02. Select the Trello Board that you would like to use from the **Trello Board** dropdown.
03. Once the board is selected, the **Trello List** option will appear. Select the Trello list that you would like to add submitted items to.
04. After selecting the Trello List, the **Card Settings** will appear. First is the **Name** field which is the name of the Trello card.
05. The **Description** field is the description of the Trello card. The Name and Description fields accept merge tags to dynamically generate content.
06. The **Due Date** field determines how many days from submission of the form the newly created task will be due. It accepts only numerical values.
07. The **Labels** field allows you to color code the newly created list item. Use the checkboxes to select any color labels you would like to be added to the item.
08. The **Members** option determines which team members will be assigned to the newly created item within Trello.
09. The **Attachments** option allows the user to attach a file to the created card.
10. **Conditional Logic**: If unchecked, every successful form submission will be sent to Trello. If you wish to set specific conditions for sending form data to Trello then check the “Enable” box and fill out your required criteria.
11. Click the **Update Settings** button to save your options.
