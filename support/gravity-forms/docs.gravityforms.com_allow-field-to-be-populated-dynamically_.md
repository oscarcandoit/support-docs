# Allow Field to be Populated Dynamically

- [Enable Dynamic Population](https://docs.gravityforms.com/allow-field-to-be-populated-dynamically/#h-enable-dynamic-population)

## Introduction

Using dynamic population in Gravity Forms allows you to dynamically populate a field with a value (or values depending on the field type).

**Note:** This guide explains how to enable dynamic population for a field. To set a default value for a field refer to this [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/?p=40991).

**Note:** For choice based fields that support dynamic population, the dynamic value will be selected if the specified value already exists.

## Enable Dynamic Population

To enable dynamic population for a field, you will go to the field’s **[Advanced Settings Section](https://docs.gravityforms.com/common-field-settings/#h-advanced-settings-section)** and check “Allow field to be populated dynamically”.

Checking this option will enable data to be passed to the form and pre-populate this field dynamically. Data can be passed via Query Strings, Shortcode and/or Hooks. After checking this option, you will need to specify the name of the parameter you will be using to pass data to this field.

_Populating a Single Line Text field with the value from a URL parameter._

_Passing the campaign\_id as a URL parameter: **campaign\_id=8237123** populates our field._
