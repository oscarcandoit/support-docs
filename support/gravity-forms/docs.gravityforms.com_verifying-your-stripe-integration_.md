# Verifying Your Stripe Integration

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/verifying-your-stripe-integration/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Verifying Your Integration](https://docs.gravityforms.com/verifying-your-stripe-integration/#h-verifying-your-integration)

## Pre-Requisites

- [Set Up The Stripe Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/downloading-installing-the-stripe-add-on/)
- [Set Up a Stripe Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-stripe-compatible-form/)
- [Create a Feed for the Stripe Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-the-stripe-feeds/)

## Verifying Your Integration

Now that your Stripe Add-On is integrated with Gravity Forms, you can test this integration through the submission of forms via Gravity Forms.

1. Make sure you have a visible _Pricing Field_ with a valid _Price_ in your form. You can ensure this by selecting **Forms**, hovering over your form, and selecting Edit. Once in Form Editor view, double-check your pricing field and make sure the price field has a value. The image below is an example of what your Pricing Field might look like. Ensure you have a Field Label and a Price, and click **Save Form**.

[![pricing field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pricing-field.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pricing-field.png)
2. Next, select **Preview** from the form editor toolbar. This will open a new tab. Fill in all of the information prior to the _Credit Card_ field.

[![Form Preview](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/preview-stripe-test.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/preview-stripe-test.png)
3. The **Stripe Field** does not require real credit card information. Instead, you will need to visit [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) to obtain a **Test Credit Card Number**.

4. Enter a test credit card number into the **Card Number** box. Fill in the **Expiration Date**, **Security Code**, and **any other required fields** (fields will vary based on location and available payment methods). Note that the expiration date must be in the future to be valid.

5. **Submit** the form.

6. Once you have submitted the form, visit [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard) and navigate to your **Dashboard**.


    [![Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stripe-dashboard.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stripe-dashboard.png)

7. If you selected either **Products & Services** or **Subscription**, you would see that your transaction has gone through under **Payments**.

[![Stripe Payments Dashboard](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stripe-payments.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stripe-payments.png)

8. If you selected **Subscription** as your transaction type when configuring your Stripe feed and don’t see funds transferred under Payments, it is most likely because you have set up a Subscription trial period. You can view the date and the amount your customer will be charged by going to **Billing > Customers** and then selecting the customer you want more information on.

[![Stripe Customer with Trial Subsctiption](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stripe-subscription-trial.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stripe-subscription-trial.png)

If you can see that your transaction has processed either as a payment or a pending transaction, your Stripe Add-On has been successfully integrated with Gravity Forms! If you need more information on setting up your Stripe Add-On, visit [the Stripe Add-On documentation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/stripe-add-on/).
