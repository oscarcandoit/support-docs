# Setting Up the Square Add-On

- [Pre-Requisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/#h-pre-requisites)
- [Getting to the Square Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/#h-getting-to-the-square-settings)
- [Mode](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/#h-mode)

- [Connecting to Sandbox](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/#connecting-to-sandbox)

**Note:** Gravity Forms and Square are offering a “ **Free Processing Promotion**” for new Square customers that can save you credit card fees for up to 180 days. [Go here for details.](https://squareup.com/t/cmtp_performance/pr_developers/d_partnerships/p_gravityforms/?route=i/FED2CBC66C)

## Pre-Requisites

- Gravity Forms and Gravity Forms Square Add-On installed
- SSL Certificate Installed and Configured
- [A Square Account](https://squareup.com/t/cmtp_performance/pr_developers/d_partnerships/p_gravityforms/?route=i/FED2CBC66C)

## Getting to the Square Settings

The Square Settings will allow you to connect and authenticate to your Square account. It will allow you to connect to either your Live or Sandbox Square environment.

Navigate to your Square Add-On Settings page:

1. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the left side navigation menu, hover over **Forms** and click on **Settings**.
3. Click on the **Square** tab.


[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/square-settings-page-1024x412.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/square-settings-page.png)

## Mode

Specify the environment you want to send your form submissions to. Choosing **Live** will send transactions to your live/production Square account and may initiate real charges. **Sandbox** will pass the form entry into your Square Sandbox environment, which will not generate any real transactions.

**Note**: Your [Gravity Forms Currency Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-page/#general-settings) **must match** the Currency Settings in your Square account or you will get an error when attempting to connect to Square.

![Square Account Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CleanShot-2021-06-07-at-17.27.06.png)

1. Under **Account Settings**, select the Mode to use for Square integration: **Live** or **Sandbox**.
2. Continue in the sections below labeled [**Connecting to Live**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/#connecting-to-live) or [**Connecting to Sandbox**](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-add-on/#connecting-to-sandbox).

### Connecting to Live

1. Select the Mode **Live** and Click the **Connect with Square** button.
2. Your web browser will pass you to a new screen showing “Redirecting you to **Square…**”

![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-24.png)

3. If you aren’t automatically redirected, there is a link to follow in the form that will take you to the Square authentication page.
4. Login with your Square Account and **Sign In**.

4. You will be directed to a **Square Permissions screen** with the message “Gravity Forms is requesting permission to do the following:” and a list of the permissions that are necessary for the feed to be properly configured.

![Image showing Square permissions request](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-23.png)

5. Click **Allow** to accept the listed permissions for Gravity Forms access to your Square account. This will connect your Square account to Gravity Forms.
6. You will be returned to the Square Settings tab. You should see “ **Connected to Square as”** with your account name.
7. A new section will also be added for **Business Location**. Your default Business Location in Square will be selected, but if you have more than one in your account, you can select the correct one from this list.
8. Click **Save Settings** to finish configuring your Square Settings.

Once you have entered your Square settings, you’re ready to begin [Setting up a Square Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-compatible-form/).

### Connecting to Sandbox

**Note:** Before connecting the Sandbox account, open your Sandbox Seller Dashboard in the same browser and keep it open in another tab. If this is not done, the OAuth flow will fail, and you will see the error:

_To start the OAuth flow for a sandbox account, first launch the seller test account from the Developer Dashboard._

Configuring the Sandbox connection requires a Developer account configured at Square. Please read the article on [Creating a Square Sandbox Account for Testing](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-square-sandbox-account-for-testing/) **prior to completing this step**.

Once you have launched the Seller Test account from the Square Developer Dashboard, you can continue connecting your Sandbox Account to the Square Add-on:

1. Select the Mode **Sandbox** and Click the **Connect with Square** button.

2. Your web browser will pass you to a new screen showing “Redirecting you to **Square…**”

3. If you have not opened the Seller Dashboard properly, you will get the following error screen:

![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-25.png)

4. If you do not get the above error message, **skip to Step 4**. Otherwise, you will need to [Open the Sandbox Seller Dashboard](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-square-sandbox-account-for-testing/) in a new window first.
5. You will be directed to a **Square Permissions screen** with the message “Gravity Forms is requesting permission to do the following:” and a list of the permissions that are necessary for the feed to be properly configured.


![Image showing Square permissions request](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-23.png)

6. Click **Allow** to accept the listed permissions for Gravity Forms access to your Square Sandbox account. This will connect your Square Sandbox account to Gravity Forms.
7. You will be returned to the Square Settings tab. You should see “ **Connected to Square as”** with your Sandbox Application Name.
8. A new section will also be added for **Business Location**. Your default Test Account Application in Square will be selected, but if you have more than one in your account, you can select the correct one from this list.
9. Click **Update Settings** to finish configuring your Square Settings.

Once you have entered your Square settings, you’re ready to begin [Setting up a Square Compatible Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-square-compatible-form/).
