## Articles

[**Section Break** \\
The Section Break field allows you to add a content separator to your form to help organize groups of fields. This is a visual element rather than an actual data collecting form field.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/section-break/ "Section Break") [**Single Line Text** \\
The Single Line Text field allows users to submit a single line of text. This basic field can be used for anything where no more than a single line of input is required.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/single-line-text/ "Single Line Text") [Previous](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/fields/standard-fields/) [1](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/fields/standard-fields/) 2
