- [Settings and Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_singleproduct/#h-settings-and-properties)
- [Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_singleproduct/#h-settings)
- [Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_singleproduct/#h-properties)
- [Source Code](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_singleproduct/#h-source-code)

## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_SingleProduct class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the Single Product field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission. Because this is a product field, the “type” property will be set to “product” and the “inputType” property to “singleproduct”.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the admin label`<br>`$admin_label``=``$field``->adminLabel;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **base\_price\_setting**


Determines whether the “Price” section displays. This allows a base price to be specified for the product.

- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.

- **disable\_quantity\_setting**


Determines whether the “Disable quantity field” checkbox appears. This allows the quantity to be removed from the field. A default value of 1 will be used, unless a separate Quantity field is added.

- **duplicate\_setting**


Controls whether the “No Duplicates” setting displays within the “Rules” section. This controls whether the same value may exist more than once in the database. The “Rules” setting must be active for this to display.

- **error\_message\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom Validation Message” setting which allows a custom message to be used appears.

- **label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.

- **rules\_setting**


Controls whether the “Rules” settings section displays. The “Required” option shows when this is active.


### Properties

Below is a listing of the properties inherited from the parent class, and the properties unique to the field.

- **adminLabel** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)
The label to be used on admin pages instead of the label, useful for fields with long labels.

- **allowsPrepopulate** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the field values can be dynamically populated. Default is false.

- **basePrice** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The price of the product. The value includes the formatting characters.

- **conditionalLogic** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An associative array containing the conditional logic rules. See the [Conditional Logic Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-logic-object) for more details.

- **cssClass** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom CSS class or classes to be added to the input tag for the field.

- **description** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field description.

- **descriptionPlacement** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The placement of the field description. The description may be placed “above” or “below” the field inputs. If the placement is not specified, then the description placement setting for the Form Layout is used.

- **disableQuantity** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Indicates whether the Quantity field is active.

- **errorMessage** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The custom error message to be displayed if the field fails validation.

- **formId** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The form ID.

- **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)

The field ID.

- **inputs** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An array containing the the individual properties for each element of the single product field.


  - **id** [integer](https://docs.gravityforms.com/integer)
    The id of the input field.

  - **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    The label for the input.

  - **name** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

    The name of the parameter used for the input when dynamically populating the field.


An example of the array output is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17 | `$inputs``=``array``(`<br>```array``(`<br>```'id'``=>``'1.1'``,`<br>```'label'``=>``'Product Name'``,`<br>```'name'``=>``'param_product'`<br>```),`<br>```array``(`<br>```'id'``=>``'1.2'``,`<br>```'label'``=>``'Price'``,`<br>```'name'``=>``'param_price'`<br>```),`<br>```array``(`<br>```'id'``=>``'1.3'``,`<br>```'label'``=>``'Quantity'``,`<br>```'name'``=>``'param_qty'`<br>```),`<br>```)` |

- **inputType** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

Specifies the type of Product field being used. For instance, when the field is for a product, the “type” is set to **product** and the “inputType” is set to **singleproduct**. When the field is created, the type is initially set using the “type” property. If “inputType” is not empty, then the “inputType” is used to create the field instead.

- **isRequired** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Marking the field as required will prevent the form from being submitted if the user does not enter a value. Default is false.

- **label** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field label that will be displayed on the form and on the admin pages.

- **noDuplicates** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)

Determines if the value entered by the user may already exist in the database.

- **type** [string](https://docs.gravityforms.com/string)

The field type, which in this case is **product**. The specific type of product field is in the “inputType” property.
