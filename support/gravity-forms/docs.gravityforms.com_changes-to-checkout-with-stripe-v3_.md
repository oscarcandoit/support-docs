## Introduction

Version 3 of the official Gravity Forms Stripe Add-On made a number of changes to bring our add-on into line with Stripe’s updates around [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-support-of-strong-customer-authentication) and [their new API](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-support-of-strong-customer-authentication). Please review this document carefully, as your existing flow using Stripe Checkout or Stripe filters may have been affected.

## Best Practices

The payment gateway add-on is a vital cog in any website, and as such you should never run updates without testing in a sandbox first. We always recommend that you:

– make a complete backup that can be used as a restore point

– switch to sandbox payment environment, and test the update first

– once satisfied, don’t forget to switch back to your production environment before you start collecting live payments.

Be cautious. Be prepared.

## Changes to the Stripe Checkout process

### Removal of the Modal Window

If you use the [Stripe Checkout method](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-stripe-compatible-form/#stripe-payment-form-stripe-checkout-), then Stripe Add-On 3.0 will modify your payment flow. With their recent API updates, **Stripe have replaced the modal window with a full page display** for the final portion of the checkout process. See [screenshots](https://docs.gravityforms.com/changes-to-checkout-with-stripe-v3/#screenshots) at bottom for examples.

### Checkout Styling

All styling options for this new window now take place in Stripe under your Branding section. All styling options that previously existed within the Stripe Add-On Feed Settings area have been removed in version 3.

## Changes to Filters

We have added some new filters with this update (see the [Change Log](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-change-log/)), but also **removed** and modified some existing hooks to orient with Stripe’s API updates.

### Removed Filters

- gform\_stripe\_currency (added in 2.7)
- gform\_stripe\_checkout\_options (added in 2.6)
- gform\_stripe\_checkout\_supported\_cards

### Modified Filters

- [gform\_stripe\_charge\_pre\_create](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_charge_pre_create) no longer works with Stripe Checkout. Use [gform\_stripe\_session\_data](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_stripe_session_data) to replace it.
