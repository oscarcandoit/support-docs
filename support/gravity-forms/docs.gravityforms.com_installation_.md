## How do I download the Gravity Forms plugin?

As with all our software, downloads require an active Gravity Forms license key and access to a Gravity Forms account. Login and go to the [Downloads section](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/downloads/) in the navigation tabs.

[![Screenshot of Your Downloads page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-28-at-13.38.42.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-28-at-13.38.42.png)

Don’t forget to check the [system requirements](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-form-system-requirements/).

Find the Gravity Forms line and click the Download link. This will save a **zip file** to your computer. Do not unzip that file.

## How do I download plugins and add-ons for Gravity Forms?

If you have an active Gravity Forms subscription, you can download available add-ons, beta releases and any included products from the [Downloads section](https://www.gravityforms.com/my-account/downloads/) of your Account. What downloads are available to you will be dependent upon what Gravity Forms license you own.

For more information on your Gravity Forms Account page, see the [guides listed here](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/your-gravity-forms-account/managing-your-account/).

For more information on Gravity Forms license types, see [this guide](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravity-forms-license-types/).

## How do I install Gravity Forms on my site?

The Gravity Forms zip file installs just like any other plugin for WordPress. You can find installation instructions in the [How to Install Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms/) article.

Also note that you can use FTP to upload the entire Gravity Forms folder to your WordPress site. To do this, follow the [How to Install Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms/) article.

## Finding and Entering Your License Key

You can find your license key in your Gravity Forms account under **Licenses.** Copy this key and go to your Gravity Forms settings page in WordPress and paste the key under **Support License Key**.

You can find more in-depth instruction in the [Finding and Entering Your License Key](https://docs.gravityforms.com/finding-your-license-key/) article.

## How do I add my first form?

Once you have [created your first form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-form/) you’ll want to embed your form in your site. There is a short code method with a simple wizard to add your form directly into your post content and there is a php function call to allow embedding the form directly into the theme files. You can find information on both methods in the [Embedding a Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/embedding-a-form/) article.
