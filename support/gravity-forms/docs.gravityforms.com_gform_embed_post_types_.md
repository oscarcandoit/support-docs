## Description

The `gform_embed_post_types` allows users to modify the post types presented in the [Embed Form flyout](https://docs.gravityforms.com/embed-form-flyout/).

## Usage

The filter which would run for all forms would be used like so:

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_embed_post_types'``,``'your_function_name'``);` |

## Parameters

- **$types** [array](https://docs.gravityforms.com/array)

An associative array of post types.


## Examples

### 1\. Adds the post type `book`

This example adds the post type with slug `book` to the Embed Form flyout.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_embed_post_types'``,``function``(``$types``) {`<br>```$types``[] =``array``(``'slug'``=>``'book'``,``'label'``=>``'Book'``);`<br>```return``$types``;`<br>`} );` |

### 2\. Removes the post type `post`

This example removes the standard `post` post type from the Embed Form flyout.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_embed_post_types'``,``function``(``$types``) {`<br>```$types``=``array_filter``(``$types``,``function``(``$type``) {`<br>```return``$type``[``'slug'``] !=``'post'``;`<br>```} );`<br>```return``$types``;`<br>`} );` |
