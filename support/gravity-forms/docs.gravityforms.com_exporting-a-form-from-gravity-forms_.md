# Exporting a Form

## Introduction

When moving a form from one location to another, or even to backup your data, we have provided a tool within Gravity Forms to perform an export of your created form with just a few clicks. In this article, we will show you how to export any forms you have created using Gravity Forms easily.

**Note:** If our Support team has directed you to export a form, please **include** _**only**_ **the requested form**. Avoid **combining multiple forms in a single export file.** If the issue involves multiple forms, include only the relevant ones.

## Steps To Export A Form

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to Forms > Import/Export

[![Forms > Import/Export menu setting](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-33.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-33.png)

2. Click on Export Forms

A list of all forms will be displayed.

3. Select the checkbox next to any forms you want to export or “Select All” to export all forms. Then, click **Download Export File**.

4. You will then be prompted to save a JSON file containing your form and all its settings. **Be sure to save this in a safe place for easy access later.**

Your form should now be successfully exported. If you need to import your form, you may review our article on [importing forms into Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/importing-a-form-into-gravity-forms).
