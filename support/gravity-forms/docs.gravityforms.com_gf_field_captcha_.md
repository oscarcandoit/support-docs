# GF\_Field\_CAPTCHA

- [Settings and Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_captcha/#h-settings-and-properties)
- [Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_captcha/#h-settings)
- [Properties](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_captcha/#h-properties)
- [Source Code](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_captcha/#h-source-code)

## Introduction

The GF\_Field\_CAPTCHA class extends the [GF\_Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field) class, also known as the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object). This class is responsible for determining how the CAPTCHA field is rendered when the form is displayed and how its value is handled during and after form submission.

## Settings and Properties

Settings control what options are available to the admin user when configuring the field in the form editor. Gravity Forms includes many built-in settings such as Field Label, Field Description, Choices, Conditional Logic, etc. In addition to built-in settings, custom settings can also be developed. For more information on how to develop custom settings and how to associate settings to a field, visit the [GF\_Field page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field/#get_form_editor_field_settings).

Properties contain the values specified by the settings and generally are part of the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object).

The properties may be retrieved by accessing the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | `//get the field`<br>`$field``= GFFormsModel::get_field(``$form``, 1 );`<br>`//get the captcha type`<br>`$captcha_type``=``$field``->captchaType;` |

### Settings

The following settings are available for the field:

- **captcha\_type\_setting**


Determines whether the “Type” section displays. If the plugin “Really Simple Captcha” is also installed, the type may be the default Google reCAPTCHA, Really Simple Captcha, or Math Challenge. The type drop down does not appear if this plugin is not available.

- **conditional\_logic\_field\_setting**


Controls whether the “Enable Conditional Logic” setting appears.

- **css\_class\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom CSS Class” setting displays. This allows a custom css to be used for the field.

- **description\_setting**


Controls whether the “Description” setting appears. This allows a description for the field to be displayed.

- **error\_message\_setting**


Controls whether the “Custom Validation Message” setting which allows a custom message to be used appears.

- **label\_setting**


Controls whether the “Field Label” setting which allows the label to be changed appears.
