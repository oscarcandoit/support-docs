## Summary

The **List** field allows the end user to add/remove additional rows (up to a pre-set limit) of information per field. This allows for the capture of multiple field values, or a variable “list” of data as defined by the end user. This is a simple version of a repeater field. For more complex repeater functionality, check out this blog post about [Collecting Repeatable Data in WordPress Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/repeatable-data-wordpress-forms/). The List field is available under the Advanced Fields section within the form editor.
