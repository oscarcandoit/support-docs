## Summary

The **Address** field makes it quick and easy to capture address information on a form. This field provides a pre-formatted area for two street addresses, city, state/province, zip/postal code, and a drop down for country selection. It is available under the Advanced Fields section within the form editor.

## Common Field Settings

Many of the options in the General, Appearance and Advanced sections are common to most fields. [Refer to this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/common-field-settings/) for a description of those common settings.

In the section below, you will find description of those settings that are unique to this field type.

## General Settings

[![Address Field General Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.00.35@2x-212x300.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.00.35@2x.png)

#### Address Type

Select the type of address you would like to use, from the choices of International, United States, Canadian.

[![GForms Address Field - International](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-17.55.51@2x-1024x420.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-17.55.51@2x.png) International

[![Address Form - United States](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.02.43@2x-1024x412.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.02.43@2x.png) United States

[![Address Form - Canadian](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.03.04@2x-1024x416.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.03.04@2x.png) Canada

Selecting an address type different from the default International type would remove the Country input, customize the labels for the Zip and State inputs, and include a drop down for states/provinces selection, but it doesn’t perform any validation of the address details entered. If you need to perform validation of the address details, you can use the [gform\_field\_validation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_field_validation/) filter to run your own code for the validation.

You can add support for a custom address type by using the [gform\_address\_types](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_address_types) filter. This filter can also be used to update the format of the predefined options as well.

#### Address Fields

| Options | Descriptions |
| --- | --- |
| **Show** (toggle) | Show or hide specific address sub-fields. For example, you could opt to hide Address Line 2, show ZIP Code, but hide the State |
| **Custom Sub-Label** | Replace the default address sub-field labels with custom text. For example, replace “Address Line 2” with “Suite or Apartment #”. |
| **Default Country/State/Province** | You can specify a default country value (for international address type), default state (for US address type) or default province (for Canadian address type). |

## Appearance Settings

[![Address Field Appearance Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.09.25@2x-300x77.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.09.25@2x.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sub-Label Placement** | Similar to the Description Placement option, but instead applies to the sub-label defined in the General settings. |

## Advanced Settings

[![Default Values Address Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gravity-Forms-Address-Settings-Default-Values.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gravity-Forms-Address-Settings-Default-Values.png)

[![Address Field Advanced Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.11.24@2x.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CleanShot-2021-05-10-at-18.11.24@2x.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Values** | Define a default value for each sub-field. Note that anything entered here will override the _Default Country/State/Province_ General Setting. If using a drop down list of values (e.g. State, Province or Country), the value entered here must be an exact match to a value offered in that list. |
| **Display Option** | Allows you to populate the field from the information submitted in another Address field. For example, to make the shipping address fields the same as the billing address.<br>Refer to section below for additional options. |

### Use values submitted in a different field

Checking this setting opens a further options as described below.

[![](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gravity-Forms-Address-Settings-Use-Other-Field-Values.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gravity-Forms-Address-Settings-Use-Other-Field-Values.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Option Label** | Text that appears next to the checkbox, defaults to “ _Same as previous_” checkbox. An example would be: “ _Use billing address_.” |
| **Source Field** | Identify the Address field that will provide the data to this field. |
| **Activated by default** | Turn’s on the “use other values” option by default at form load. This will hide the address fields, and display only the (filled) check box. If a user un-checks it, the other fields will appear again. |

## Custom Format

To change the expected format of one of the offered custom formats, you can replace the Address field with multiple [Single Line Text fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/single-line-text/), and establish an input mask for those you wish to be non-standard. You can learn more about input masks in this [article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/input-mask/).

## Conditional Logic Support

You can configure conditional logic rules on _other_ fields based on the values of the Address sub-field inputs.

## CSS Targeting Examples

[Address Field Targeting Examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/address-field-2/)

## Extending the Address Field

Looking for information about what properties the Address field uses in the [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object), what format its value is stored in the [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object) and how you can access it, or what hooks/filters it includes? Then take a look at the [GF\_Field\_Address](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gf_field_address) article.
