## Introduction

As of November 2025, we have adopted an updated version control schema for all our products, including Gravity Forms core and add-ons. This article provides an overview of our version numbers and their relationship to the various types of updates we offer, as well as a methodology that allows our users to determine the basic impact of an update by knowing just the version number.

## Benefits

Inspired by Semantic Versioning (but diverging from its precise specification), this improved version numbering scheme provides our customers with immediate information on the possible types of content just by viewing the version number. The intent here is to _enable our customers to clearly identify the implications of a version update even before they have reviewed the changelog_.

This represents a modification to our previous approach, where major versions did not carry a stated commitment regarding the content contained within, minor versions were not available for auto-update, and add-ons were updated using a different numbering method.

## Version Numbering

### Nomenclature

Most releases will follow the following nomenclature:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- where each of the arguments above is an integer with no leading zeros.
- where any increase in one number means the numbers following restart at 0. For example: Release 1.2.3 could be followed by 1.2.4, 1.3.0, or 2.0.0

### Version Number Meaning

Each release implies a specific type of update which can be identified by the digit that was incremented.

- A **MAJOR** version number will be incremented when we make **changes that may break existing functionality**. We strive for backwards compatibility, but with the very long life of Gravity Forms, sometimes internal changes are necessary that may break older functionality. In most cases, this is changing an integration point, such as removing or changing the behavior of a filter. Major versions will not auto-update and require a manual action to update via the WordPress Updates or Installed Plugins pages.
- A **MINOR** version number increase will be made when we **add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.** This may include the roll-up and “full” release of previous hotfix releases. They can be installed via automatic background updates.
- A **PATCH** version number will increase with every release of **backward-compatible bug fixes**. This may include new fixes and/or the roll-up and “full” release of previous hotfix releases. They can be installed via automatic background updates.

For information on where to find the settings for automatic background updates, refer to [this article](https://docs.gravityforms.com/the-importance-of-updates/), which discusses the importance of updates.

### Additional Suffixes

#### **Hotfixes**

A hotfix will include a fourth integer after the most recently released version number.

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.HOTFIX**

A **hotfix** is a version with a specific bug fix or a critical security fix for confirmation. It focuses on a specific issue rather than a broad set of enhancements. Hotfixes are not typically made available to the auto-update system, but they can be downloaded or provided directly to affected customers through our Support channels. A hotfix must be installed manually. We occasionally make exceptions to this if our security team determines that a hotfix is required more urgently due to the potential width of a specific vulnerability.

Example: **Gravity Forms 2.9.12.1** would be a hotfix released to resolve an issue that arose after the release of Gravity Forms 2.9.12.

You only need to install a hotfix if it explicitly addresses an issue affecting your site or if directed to do so by our support team. Otherwise, wait for the next scheduled patch, minor, or major release.

Once a hotfix is confirmed, it will be released in a “roll-up”.

##### Rolling Up a Hotfix

The fourth hotfix digit will go away when the fix or changes it contains are confirmed as effective and “rolled up” into the next Patch, Minor, or Major release. Once rolled up, the changelog entries for preceding hotfixes are also combined into a single entry for the Patch release.

Example:

Hotfix **Gravity Forms 2.8.19.1** & hotfix **Gravity Forms 2.8.19.2** could be rolled up into **Gravity Forms 2.8.20** (which may also include additional previously unpublished fixes). They could also be rolled up into **Gravity Forms 2.9**, which includes previously released hotfixes, previously unpublished fixes, and some new (backwards-compatible) functionality.

#### Beta and Release Candidates

A pre-release or beta is generally a sneak preview of upcoming new functionality that is made available for customer sandbox testing. To identify a pre-release, a suffix will be added in the format of: dash (-) followed by a keyword, then a period (.) and an integer.

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-{keyword}.{integer}**

Pre-releases and Betas are provided outside the normal distribution and must be manually downloaded and installed. No auto-updating is provided for pre-release or beta versions. If you update a pre-release or beta version, you will be upgraded to the latest stable version.

In this case, the preceding digits (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) identify the release that the pre-release or beta update is **aiming towards**. That is, the version number the package will take once the pre-release period is successfully completed.

Example1 : The first release candidate or beta of Salesforce Add-On might be **Salesforce 1.0.0-rc.1** or **Salesforce 1.0.0-beta.1**.

Example 2: As Gravity Forms 2.10 goes through development with a large number of new features, it may be released as **Gravity Forms 2.10.0-beta.1** to allow customers to sandbox test some of the new functionality.

## Scope

This methodology will be adopted across all our packages starting with releases from November 2025 onwards. Previously released version numbers have not been altered.

For a period, you may see a mix of legacy two or three-digit add-on releases and new four-part releases. Both formats remain valid until the transition is fully complete.

## Summary

This table summarizes the above information. It only applies to updates and versions released after the adoption of this version numbering system.

| Release Type <br>Sample Version\* | Contains | Available to Auto-Update?\*\* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Major**<br>Gravity Forms **3**.0.0 | New functionality or fixes. Contains changes that may alter or break existing functionality. | No |
| **Minor**<br>Stripe 6 **.1**.0 | New functionality and or fixes that are all backwards compatible. | Yes |
| **Patch**<br>Partial Entries 1.8 **.2** | Fixes that are backward compatible. | Yes |
| **Hotfix**<br>Breeze 1.8.1 **.1** | A fix in an interim release to address a specific issue. Will be rolled up into the next non-hotfix release. | No |
| **Beta**<br>reCAPTCHA 3.0.0 **-beta.3** | Pre-release for customer testing during development of a major or minor release. | No |
| **Release Candidate**<br>Quiz 4.0.0 **-rc.1** | Pre-release, that signals the approaching end of development for a minor or major release. Further release candidates may follow. | No |

_(\*) These are samples only and may not correspond to actual releases._

_(\*\*) Not all sites will receive updates simultaneously; updates may roll out gradually to ensure stability._
