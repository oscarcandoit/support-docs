## Overview

The Authorize.Net API used by this add-on is no longer actively maintained or supported by Authorize.Net.

Due to this, the Gravity Forms Authorize.Net Add-On has been classified as a Legacy Add-On, deprecated, and will be retired entirely in the future.

This guide explains how to migrate a form that uses the Authorize.Net Add-On to one of Gravity Forms’ supported payment add-ons.

The general migration process is the same for all gateways:

- Decide whether to duplicate your form or edit the existing one
- Replace the legacy Credit Card field with the new payment field
- Create and configure a new payment feed
- Disable or remove the old Authorize.Net feed for clarity
- Test your setup before going live


**Note:** Continuing to use the Authorize.Net Add-On may result in payment failures or disruptions due to API-level changes outside of Gravity Forms’ control.

## Step 1: Decide Whether to Duplicate or Edit Your Form

Before making any changes, choose how you want to approach the migration.

### Option A: Duplicate Your Form

Duplicating your form allows you to make all changes safely without impacting your existing data or live submissions.

**To duplicate**

1. Go to **Forms → Forms**.
2. Hover over your Authorize.Net form and click **Duplicate**.
3. Rename it (for example, _Payment Form – Stripe_).

### Option B: Edit Your Existing Form

If you prefer to keep all sales data within a single form, you can edit the existing form directly.

**Note:** When you delete a field, all data previously captured for that field is also deleted from existing entries. Export entries before editing if you want to preserve historical payment-field data.

## Step 2: Install and Connect a New Payment Add-On

Choose one of the available Gravity Forms payment add-ons and connect your account.

**Available Payment Add-Ons**

- [Stripe Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-add-on/)
- [PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-checkout-add-on/)
- [Square Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/square-add-on/)
- [Mollie Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/mollie-add-on/)
- [2Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/add-ons-gravity-forms/2checkout-add-on/)


**To connect**

1. Go to **Forms → Settings → \[Payment Add-On Name\]**.
2. Click **Connect Account**.
3. Follow the prompts to authorize and link your account.
4. Verify the connection shows as “Connected.”

## Step 3: Replace the Legacy Credit Card Field

The Credit Card field used for the Authorize.Net Add-On is not compatible with other gateways and [is deprecated](https://docs.gravityforms.com/deprecation-of-the-gravity-forms-credit-card-field/).

Each payment add-on includes its own secure payment field.

1. In your form, delete the existing **Credit Card** field.
2. Add the payment field for your new gateway (for example, **Stripe Field**, **PayPal Field**, or **Square Field**).
3. Save your form.


**Important:** The new payment field must be added to the form before you can create a new feed (step 5).

## Step 4: Review Product and Pricing Fields

All of your existing Product and pricing configurations should remain intact and continue to function correctly after switching to a new payment add-on. The supported payment add-ons automatically recognize and use existing Product, Option, Quantity, Shipping, and Total fields without requiring you to recreate or remap them.

**However, it is recommended that you still check that:**

- Product fields are still correctly configured.
- Prices and options display correctly.
- Conditional logic still behaves as expected.

## Step 5: Create a New Payment Feed

Each payment add-on requires a feed to handle payment processing.

1. Go to **Form Settings → \[Payment Add-On Name\]**.
2. Click **Add New**.
3. Choose a transaction type ( _Products and Services_ or _Subscription_).
4. Map any relevant fields (for example, Email, Name, Billing Address).
5. Save your feed.


## Step 6: Test Your Form

Before going live:

1. Submit test entries using **Test Mode** or **Sandbox Mode**.
2. Confirm that:
   - Totals calculate correctly
   - Transactions complete successfully

## Step 7: Go Live

When everything looks good and the testing is complete, be sure that:

- If you duplicated the form, you replace the original shortcode with the new one wherever it’s embedded.
- You need to switch to Live Mode to begin processing live transactions.

**Note**: If you edited the existing form, no embed changes are required.

## Step 8: Deactivate & Remove the Authorize.net Add-On

After your new payment add-on is configured, disable or delete the old Authorize.Net feed.

Once all of your forms have been successfully migrated to a new payment add-on, we recommend that you also deactivate and delete the add-on from your site:

- **Deactivate** the Authorize.Net Add-On from **Plugins → Installed Plugins**.
- **Delete** it from your site to avoid running deprecated code.
