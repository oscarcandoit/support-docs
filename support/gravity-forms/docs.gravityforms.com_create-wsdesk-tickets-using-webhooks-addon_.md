## Introduction

Using the Gravity Forms Webhooks Add-On is the easiest way to send requests to the [WSDesk API](https://elextensions.com/knowledge-base/use-wsdesk-create-ticket-api-third-party-forms-plugins/) to create support tickets when a form is submitted.

**Note:** This article assumes you have [installed and activated](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-install-gravity-forms-add-ons/) the Webhooks Add-On and the [WSDesk](https://elextensions.com/plugin/wsdesk-wordpress-support-desk-plugin/) plugin. If not, you will need to do so before any of the functionality in this article can be used.

## Setting Up the Form

Set up your form with the following fields and their labels: Single Line Text – **Event Title**, Paragraph – **Event Description**, Checkboxes – **Event Options**, Date – **Start Date** and **End Date**, Time – **Start Time** and **End Time.**

For the Checkboxes field, set these as the choices: All Day, Hide From Event Listings, Sticky in Month View, Feature Event

For the Time fields set up the Conditional Logic to Show field if **Event Options** is not **All Day**.

## Configuring the Webhook

To configure webhooks for a form go to your **Form Settings** and click on the **Webhooks** tab and then click the **Add New** button.

Next, you’ll need to configure the request that is being made.

[![WSDesk Webhook Feed Settings](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-10-at-18.38.22.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CleanShot-2021-07-10-at-18.38.22.png)

#### Name

Enter a name for your feed. This is never displayed and is only used for identification purposes. You can name this anything you want.

#### Request URL

The WSDesk endpoint for creating tickets is your site’s own Admin Ajax URL. The easiest way to include this URL is to enter the [{admin\_ajax\_url}](https://docs.gravityforms.com/admin_ajax_url-merge-tag/) merge tag. It will be replaced with the correct URL when the feed is processed.

#### Request Method

Select the **POST** choice as the request method.

#### Request Format

Select the **FORM** choice as the request format.

#### Request Headers

We won’t be configuring any request headers.

#### Request Body

Select the **Select Fields** choice.

#### Field Values

Configure rows for the following fields, selecting **Add Custom Value** when configuring their values. Click the add item icon (+) to add new rows.

| Key | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| **action** | wsdesk\_api\_create\_ticket |
| **api\_key** | The WSDesk API key from the **WSDesk** \> **Settings** \> **General** tab |

Next, you would configure additionals rows for the [ticket fields](https://elextensions.com/knowledge-base/set-up-wsdesk-wordpress-helpdesk-plugin/#articleTOC_4) which you have configured in WSDesk.

Enter the ticket field key (e.g. request\_email) in the key input. For the values, you can select from the form fields, entry meta, or **Add Custom Value** which will display a text input that supports [Merge Tags](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/).

#### Webhook Condition

If ticket creation should be conditional based on the value of a form field, select the **Enable Condition** checkbox and then configure the rules which should be met for this request to be sent.

## Alternative Method

If you don’t have an Elite or legacy Developer license and would prefer not to [upgrade your existing license](https://docs.gravityforms.com/licensing-faq/#license-upgrades), you can still create tickets in WSDesk by using the [gform\_after\_submission](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_after_submission) filter in your theme functions.php file or a custom functionality plugin.

See the [How to use WSDesk create ticket API with third-party forms and plugins?](https://elextensions.com/knowledge-base/use-wsdesk-create-ticket-api-third-party-forms-plugins/#articleTOC_7) article by WSDesk for more details.
