## Summary

The **Embed Form flyout**, released with Gravity Forms 2.6, provides a simple way to add your form to a page or post from directly within the Form Editor. It utilizes the [WordPress Block Editor](https://docs.gravityforms.com/how-to-add-gravity-forms-blocks/) to allow you to include it in an existing or new post or page. You can also use this new interface to copy the [form shortcode](https://docs.gravityforms.com/shortcodes/) and then insert your form using [existing shortcode methods.](https://docs.gravityforms.com/adding-a-form-using-classic-editor/)

## Accessing the Embed Form flyout

The top bar of the Form Editor has a new button “Embed” which loads the Embed Form flyout
