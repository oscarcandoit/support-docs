# Setting up a PayPal Checkout Compatible Form

- [Prerequisites](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-paypal-checkout-compatible-form/#h-prerequisites)
- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-paypal-checkout-compatible-form/#h-introduction)
- [Create Your Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-paypal-checkout-compatible-form/#h-create-your-form)

- [Notes](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-a-paypal-checkout-compatible-form/#h-notes)

## Prerequisites

See the [Using the PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-the-paypal-commerce-platform-add-on/) article.

## Introduction

The next step in integrating the PayPal Checkout Add-On is to create the form that you will use. This can include existing forms. To be compatible with the PayPal Checkout Add-On, your Gravity Form must contain:

- One or more [Product fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/product-field/)
- The [PayPal Field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/paypal-field/)

## Create Your Form

1. From the left-hand navigation menu of your WordPress admin dashboard, hover over Forms and click on New Form.
2. Enter a **Form Title** and **Form Description**. Click **Create Form**. Alternatively you can hover over **Forms** and click on **Forms** to choose an existing form from the list.
3. You can import the **eCommerce PayPal Checkout** template from the [template library](https://www.gravityforms.com/form-templates/ecommerce-paypal-form/).
4. When using multiple payment add-ons, utilize conditional logic to display or hide fields based on the selected payment method. See [Setting Up Conditional Payments In Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-conditional-payments/) for guidance.

[![PayPal Checkout Form from the template library](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-25.png)](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-25.png)

## Summary

Now that you have created your form, visit the [Configuring a Feed for the PayPal Checkout Add-On](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-a-feed-for-the-paypal-commerce-platform-add-on/) article for the next step in the integration process.

**Note**: Adding a feed is a **critical step**. If the form does not have an active PayPal Checkout feed the PayPal Checkout will NOT process the form submission.

If you need help with creating forms, visit [Creating a Form](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/getting-started/creating-a-form/) for more information.

## Notes

- When using Page fields to create a multi-page form, the PayPal Field should be located on the last page of the form.
- If you delete the PayPal Field from your form, the PayPal Checkout feeds will automatically deactivate to prevent them from running during form submission. This is because, without the field, a validation error would occur due to PayPal being unable to capture the payment details.
- The add-on doesn’t support having multiple forms in the same page using PayPal Checkout.

- LinkedIn


This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
