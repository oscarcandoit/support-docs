## Description

This filter can be used to prevent the pricing summary being included in the output generated when using the {all\_fields} merge tag. The pricing fields will be output just like the other form fields instead.

## Usage

The following would apply to all forms:

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_display_product_summary'``,``'your_function_name'``, 10, 4 );` |

## Parameters

- **$display\_product\_summary** [boolean](https://docs.gravityforms.com/boolean)
Is the pricing summary table to be included in the {all\_fields} output? Default is true.

- **$field** [Field Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-object)

The field currently being processed.

- **$form** [Form Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-object)

The form currently being processed.

- **$entry** [Entry Object](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-object)

The entry currently being processed.


## Examples

### 1\. Disable for all forms

This example shows how you can disable the pricing summary table for all forms.

|     |
| --- |
| `add_filter(``'gform_display_product_summary'``,``'__return_false'``);` |

### 2\. Disable for a specific form

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4 | `add_filter(``'gform_display_product_summary'``,``function``(``$display_product_summary``,``$field``,``$form``,``$entry``) {`<br>```return``rgar(``$form``,``'id'``) == 10 ? false :``$display_product_summary``;`<br>`}, 10, 4 );` |

## Placement

This code can be used in the [functions.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/) file of the active theme, a custom functions plugin, a custom add-on, or with a code snippets plugin.
