# Basics Of The Settings API

- [Introduction](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-api-basics/#h-introduction)
- [Field Type Examples](https://docs.gravityforms.com/settings-api-basics/#h-field-type-examples)

## Introduction

The [Add-On Framework](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework) includes a Settings API that can be used to create form and plugin settings pages. The API provides the mechanisms for rendering field UIs and saving values automatically. It supports standard field types like radio buttons, text boxes and checkboxes and also custom field types.

**Note:** In order to use the Settings API, your class must extend one of the [GFAddon](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/developers/php-api/add-on-framework/classes/) Classes.

## Field Type Examples

See [this list of standard Field Types](https://docs.gravityforms.com/field-types/) for detail and implementation examples of the various field types offered through this API.
