### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#overview) Overview

You can use webhooks (aka “outbounds”) in [KlickTipp](https://wpfusion.com/go/klick-tipp) to send data back to your WordPress site using WP Fusion.

Using webhooks you can create new users on your WordPress site based on actions in KlickTipp, or update existing users’ meta data and tags.

Having trouble receiving webhooks? [Check out our troubleshooting guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other-common-issues/webhooks-not-being-received-by-wp-fusion/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#setup) Setup

In your KlickTipp account, head to Automatisierung » Outbounds » [Neuer Outbound](https://app.klicktipp.com/tools/me/outbound/add) to create a new outbound.

[![Screenshot of KlickTipp outbound configuration](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/klick-tipp-webhooks-1024x813.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/klick-tipp-webhooks.jpg)

Enter a name for your outbound, and select an activation trigger, for example when a tag is applied or a contact is updated.

In the **Activation URL**, enter the URL to your site following the examples below. Make sure to include your access key, which you can find on the general tab in the WP Fusion settings.

For the **Request method**, select _POST_.

Then click **Add fields** and select _Subscriber ID_ from the dropdown. The Subscriber ID is the only field required by WP Fusion.

Click _Save and Test_ to test your webhook.

[![screenshot](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/klick-tipp-webhook-logs-1024x279.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/klick-tipp-webhook-logs.jpg)

In the [WP Fusion logs](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/activity-logs/) on your site, you should see the incoming webhook, followed by a message that contact ID 12345 was not found. This is normal, since _12345_ is not a real contact ID, it’s just used when testing the webhook.

**If you see this message, your webhooks are working.**

If you don’t see any activity in the logs, verify your webhook URL, and then review our [webhook troubleshooting guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other-common-issues/webhooks-not-being-received-by-wp-fusion/), as it’s possible the webhook is being blocked by a firewall or security rule.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#webhook-url-parameters) Webhook URL parameters

You can format your webhook URL in a few different ways to customize the behavior:

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#to-update-a-users-tags) To update a user’s tags

To update an existing WordPress user’s tags from the contact record, the URL for the webhook should look like the following:

`https://mydomain.com/?wpf_action=update_tags&access_key=YOURACCESSKEY`

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#to-update-a-users-tags-and-meta-data) To update a user’s tags and meta data

To update a user’s tags and pull any new meta data from KlickTipp for that contact, the URL for the webhook should look like the following:

`https://mydomain.com/?wpf_action=update&access_key=YOURACCESSKEY`

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#create-a-new-user) Create a new user

To create a new user, use the following URL:

`https://mydomain.com/?wpf_action=add&access_key=YOURACCESSKEY`

You can also specify additional parameters in user creation. For example, to send the user a welcome email containing a link to log in on your site, use the following:

`https://mydomain.com/?wpf_action=add&access_key=YOURACCESSKEY&send_notification=true`

You can also specify a specific user role to be assigned to the new user. For example, to set the new user to the “customer” role, use the following:

`https://mydomain.com/?wpf_action=add&access_key=YOURACCESSKEY&role=customer`

Note that you have to have registered a “customer” role on your site for this to work. By default users will be assigned the role of “subscriber”.

The add method **will update a user** if an existing user already exists. It will not create a duplicate user.

**Note:** By default, user accounts will be created with their email address as the username and a randomly generated password. However, if you have created a custom username field and password field in your KlickTipp application, and enabled these fields in WP Fusion for sync with `user_login` and `user_pass` on your website, the new users will be given the usernames and passwords stored in their KlickTipp contact record.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/klicktipp-webhooks/\#user-passwords) User passwords

New user accounts will be created with an automatically generated password. If you’d like to use this password in your email marketing, you can send the password back to KlickTipp after it has been generated.

In the Webhooks section of the General settings tab, check the box for Return Password, and select a field in KlickTipp where the password should be stored.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/password-1024x208.png)

After a new user is created, their automatically generated password will now be saved back to their contact record, and you can use a merge field to include it in an email. The username will be the contact’s email address.
