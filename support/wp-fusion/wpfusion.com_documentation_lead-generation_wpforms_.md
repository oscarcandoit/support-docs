### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/wpforms/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WPForms](https://wpfusion.com/go/wpforms) to save form submissions to your CRM or marketing automation system. Using WP Fusion you can add and update contacts when forms are submitted, and also apply tags.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/wpforms/\#setup) Setup

After creating a form, navigate to the Marketing settings section and select WP Fusion from the list. Click “Add New Connection” to create a new feed.

[![screenshot](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpforms-connection-1024x525.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpforms-connection-scaled.jpg)

For each field on your form you can select the corresponding CRM field where the data should be stored.

You can also specify any tags that should be applied to contacts when the form is submitted.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/wpforms/\#conditional-logic) Conditional Logic

You can also create multiple connections and use the conditional logic options to apply different tags depending on the values of form fields.

To avoid having to re-map your form fields for each condition, check the toggle for _Use as primary field mapping_ on the connection you want to use to map your fields.

[![screenshot](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wp-forms-conditional-logic-1024x948.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wp-forms-conditional-logic-scaled.jpg) Create a single connection containing your field mapping, and then create multiple additional connections to apply tags based on conditional logic.

The field mapping for the selected connection will be used to create or update the contact in your CRM, and then tags in the remaining connections will be dynamically applied based on the configured conditional logic.
