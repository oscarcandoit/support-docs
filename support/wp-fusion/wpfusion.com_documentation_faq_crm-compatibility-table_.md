### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#crm-compatibility) CRM Compatibility

WP Fusion works with most of the most popular CRMs and marketing automation tools available. WP Fusion’s options within WordPress are universal across all of our supported CRMs: you can control access to page content based on CRM tags, lists, or groups, and sync data to your CRM when users register or fill out forms.

Some options are limited by the features in the connected CRM. For example some platforms don’t have webhooks, so data can’t be sent _back to_ WordPress automatically when records are modified in the CRM.

Other platforms don’t have an ecommerce component, and so they don’t work with WP Fusion’s [Enhanced Ecommerce addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/).

For details on our ratings and what each of the addons do, please [see the description after the table](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/#legend).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#table-legend) Table Legend

- **WP Fusion Core:** The core WP Fusion plugin is included with all license levels. It includes all of our plugin integrations, and allows you to sync contact data and apply tags with your CRM.
- **[Webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/#webhooks):** These systems support sending data back to WP Fusion [via webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/#webhooks), allowing you to automatically create new WordPress users and update their data via automations in the CRM.
- **Create New Tags in WordPress:** These platforms don’t use internal IDs for tags, tags are just stored as a text name. This means that new tags can be created inside of WP Fusion, or can even be [generated dynamically from WooCommerce order data](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce/#automatic-tagging) or [user metadata](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/#dynamic-tagging). However this also means that you can’t rename a tag without updating it across all of WP Fusion’s settings.
- **[Ecommerce Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/):** This plugin is available to Plus license holders and higher. It sends detailed ecommerce data to your CRM, including products purchased, prices, and quantities.
- **[Event Tracking Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/event-tracking-overview/):** This plugin is available to Plus license holders and higher. It sends events or engagements to the timeline / activity feed component in supported CRMs.
- [**Media Tools Addon**](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/media-tools/media-tools-overview/) **:** This plugin is available to Plus license holders and higher. It gives you tools for tracking engagement with media files on your site by applying tags. This addon works with all supported CRMs.
- **[Logins Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/logins/overview/):** This plugin is available to Plus license holders and higher. It gives you additional tools for managing the user login process by applying tags and performing redirects based on various conditions. This addon works with all supported CRMs.
- **[Abandoned Cart Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/abandoned-cart-tracking/abandoned-cart-overview/):** This plugin is available to Plus license holders and higher. It allows you to track abandoned carts in WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads by applying tags in your CRM. This addon works with all supported CRMs.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#ratings) Ratings

The ratings system is entirely subjective and doesn’t necessarily reflect on the quality of the platform, but rather how well the integration with WordPress works via WP Fusion. Some platforms are missing features (like webhooks) that limit how data can be synced. Other platforms have unreliable APIs that may result in some data being lost.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#a) A+

ActiveCampaign and Drip both earn A+ ratings. Both integrations are in use on thousands of WP Fusion powered sites, are thoroughly tested, and we’ve found the Drip and ActiveCampaign APIs to be some of the most reliable.

Both Drip and ActiveCampaign support Enhanced Ecommerce as well as being able to send abandoned cart campaigns containing the full cart details from WooCommerce.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#a) A

These platforms are well tested and in use on many WP Fusion powered sites. Their APIs are very reliable, and they can send webhooks— allowing for a bidirectional sync between WordPress and the CRM. They are missing some of the more advanced ecommerce and cart recovery tools available with ActiveCampaign and Drip.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#b) B

These platforms are generally well tested, but may have some limitations— like the number of tags or segments you can create (Zoho), limited automation capabilities, or unreliable API performance (ConvertKit).

In the case of Zoho and Brevo, both are quite strict about the formatting of data synced over the API, which can require extra time during setup to ensure your synced field values aren’t throwing API errors.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#c) C

These platforms are only tested for basic compatibility with WP Fusion and aren’t in use on many sites. They may have components that haven’t yet been tested fully (like webhooks, or support for syncing dates, multiselects, and other non-text field formats).

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#d) D

These platforms have significant limitations in their APIs that will make WP Fusion harder to work with, and it will run more slowly as multiple API calls are needed when normally only one would be necessary. We do not recommend using any of these CRMs unless you are prepared for additional time spent troubleshooting errors.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#known-limitations) Known Limitations

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#agilecrm) AgileCRM

**AgileCRM doesn’t have an API method for listing the available custom fields in your account.**

To get around this, WP Fusion queries the first 1000 contacts in the CRM, and builds up the list of available custom fields based on the fields found on those subscribers. For more information see [Custom fields not loading with AgileCRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/custom-fields-not-loading-with-agilecrm/).

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#bento) Bento

**Bento treats email addresses as case sensitive.**

This means that _JaneDoe@gmail.com_ and _janedoe@gmail.com_ are considered unique subscribers in Bento, with their own custom field values and tags.

To correct for this, WP Fusion will convert all email addresses to lowercase before they are synced to Bento. This ensures that duplicate subscriber records aren’t created if customers use capital letters in their email addresses.

However, if you have any other services connected to Bento, you will need to ensure that they are also configured to sync email addresses as lowercase, otherwise you could end up with data fragmented across multiple duplicate subscriber records.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#constant-contact) Constant Contact

**Constant Contact does not allow you to trigger an automation or email when a tag is applied.**

The only way to trigger a campaign is when a contact is first added to a list, which means that it’s not possible to trigger an email to a contact who was already on your list and was only just recently tagged.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#engagebay) Engagebay

**EngageBay doesn’t allow subscribers to change their email addresses.**

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#getresponse) GetResponse

**GetResponse does not support webhooks**

GetResponse doesn’t have the ability to trigger a webhook within an automation, or when a subscriber is updated or tagged. This means that changes in GetResponse do not sync back to WordPress in real time. You will need to manually trigger an update for users’ [tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/#syncing-tags) and [custom field data](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/#syncing-tags).

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#gist) Gist

**WP Fusion can not sync more than one WordPress site with Gist.**

Gist requires all new _User_ subscribers (as opposed to _Leads_) to be created with a user ID parameter as well as an email address.

Because WordPress hands out IDs to new users sequentially, this means that if you have more than one site, you will have different users who share the same ID. In Gist, this causes the records to get merged.

As an example:

- jane@gmail.com signs up on SiteA and gets WordPress user ID 3
- This gets synced to Gist and creates a Gist subscriber with user ID 3
- Then steve@gmail.com signs up on SiteB and _also_ gets WordPress user ID 3 (because they’re assigned sequentially)
- When that is synced to Gist, Gist sees that there’s already a user with that ID, and overwrites jane@gmail.com’s record

For this reason it’s not recommended to use WP Fusion with Gist on more than one website. A possible workaround is to instead use a multisite, since then the users are shared between sites and will only ever have one ID per person.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#hubspot) HubSpot

**To get the most out of WP Fusion, you will need access to Workflows**, which are only available with the HubSpot’s premium [Marketing Hub Professional plan](https://wpfusion.com/go/hubspot-pricing).

Workflows are required to automatically send list assignment updates back to WordPress [via webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/hubspot-webhooks/). Contact property updates can still be synced back to WordPress automatically by configuring a [webhook in a private app](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/hubspot-webhooks/#webhooks-in-private-apps).

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#mailerlite) MailerLite

**MailerLite doesn’t allow subscribers to change their email addresses.**

To get around this, WP Fusion has an option (on the Advanced settings tab) to [_Duplicate and Delete_ a user’s subscriber record if they change their email address](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/email-address-changes-with-mailerlite/).

When this is enabled, an email address change in WordPress will trigger WP Fusion to load the user’s subscriber record, delete the old subscriber, and then make a new subscriber with the updated email (including all custom fields and groups).

However, this will kick the subscriber out of any automations, and all site tracking and email engagement history will be lost.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#salesforce) Salesforce

**WP Fusion does not integrate with multiple Salesforce objects at the same time.**

While WP Fusion is fully compatible with Salesforce, we use the same framework to interface with Salesforce as we use to interface with ActiveCampaign and other email marketing tools.

That means WP Fusion can sync contacts [bidirectionally](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/salesforce-outbound-messages/) with Salesforce, update custom fields on contact records, and [apply tags (or topics)](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/salesforce-tags/) based on events in WordPress. Everything that is possible with ActiveCampaign is possible with Salesforce.

_However_, WP Fusion was [not designed for keeping multiple objects in sync](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_crm_object_type/#can-wp-fusion-interface-with-multiple-object-types-at-the-same-time) between WordPress and the CRM at the same time. If you want a new WooCommerce product to create a new _Product_ object in Salesforce, or a new course completion to update a Progress object in Salesforce, this isn’t possible with WP Fusion without [custom development](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_crm_object_type/#can-wp-fusion-interface-with-multiple-object-types-at-the-same-time).

For simple multi-object sync with Salesforce, some people have had success with the [Object Sync for Salesforce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/object-sync-for-salesforce).

We also have a tutorial on [using Salesforce Flows with WP Fusion to update multiple custom objects when contacts are updated](https://wpfusion.com/tutorials/syncing-wp-fusion-with-multiple-objects-in-salesforce-the-events-calendar-example/).

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#brevo) Brevo

**Brevo doesn’t use an ID to identify subscribers, just their email address.**

This can sometimes result in situations where updating your email address (for example via a WooCommerce checkout) causes you to lose all of your lists and access to content protected by WP Fusion.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#sendfox) SendFox

**SendFox doesn’t allow subscribers to change their email addresses.**

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#sendlane) Sendlane

**Sendlane doesn’t allow subscribers to change their email addresses.**

**Sendlane doesn’t allow tagging unverified subscribers.**

By default, subscribers added to your Sendlane account are not available over the API until they have confirmed their email address. That means that if someone registers on your site or purchases a product, they will _not_ receive the tags required to access that product.

To fix this, you will need to disable [double opt-in in Sendlane](https://help.sendlane.com/article/404-how-to-customize-your-unsubscribe-and-email-preferences-pages).

**Sendlane doesn’t allow updating addresses over the API.**

While Sendlane has built in fields to store subscriber addresses, these are not available over the API. To sync customer addresses to Sendlane with WP Fusion you will need to create custom fields to store the data.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/\#zoho) Zoho

**Zoho severely limits the number of tags you can have.** This makes working with WP Fusion difficult.

The total number of tags you can have in your account are:

- 10 on Standard
- 30 on Professional
- 50 on Enterprise

The maximum number of tags a single contact can have regardless of plan is 10.

For an alternative to tags with Zoho, consider [using a multi-select picklist](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/zoho-tags/).
