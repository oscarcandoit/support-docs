# Updating Leads with ConvertFox, Intercom, and Zoho

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/updating-leads/\#overview) Overview

With most CRMs, WP Fusion interfaces with the Contacts object by default, though this can be [overridden with a filter](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_crm_object_type/).

With ConvertFox, Intercom, and Zoho, the Lead object is sufficiently similar to the Contact object that WP Fusion can automatically switch between the object types during a form submission.

To enable this, check the box for Sync Leads on the Integrations tab in the WP Fusion settings.

[![screenshot](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/zoho-sync-leads-1024x636.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/zoho-sync-leads.jpg)

Whenever a form is submitted from one of WP Fusion’s [supported form integrations](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/#lead-generation), WP Fusion will first check to see if there is a matching contact ID for the submitted email address.

If no contact is found, WP Fusion will create a new Lead record instead of a new Contact record (it will also update an existing Lead record if one is found).

Note this is an experimental feature and may not work with all tags or custom fields. For more flexibility, consider using the [wpf\_crm\_object\_type filter](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_crm_object_type/).
