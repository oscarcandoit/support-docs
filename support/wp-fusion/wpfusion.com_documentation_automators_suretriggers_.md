### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/suretriggers/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [OttoKit (formerly SureTriggers)](https://wpfusion.com/go/suretriggers) to allow you to trigger hundreds of third-party services based on tag changes in [your connected CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/suretriggers/\#setup) Setup

Create a new workflow and select WP Fusion as the trigger.

[![a workflow automation interface showing a step labeled add first step and a sidebar titled add trigger with a list of wordpress related triggers, including wp fusion, highlighted with an orange arrow.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ottokit-wpfusion-trigger-1024x549.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ottokit-wpfusion-trigger.png)

The available options are **Tag Added to User**, **Tag Removed from User** and **User Tag Modified**. For each you can select a single tag from the dropdown.

Then, connect your trigger to one or more actions.

[![a workflow diagram in ottokit shows two steps: wp fusion tag added to user followed by wordpress create/update user, with connected icons indicating the automated process.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ottokit-wpfusion-action-1024x482.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ottokit-wpfusion-action.png)

When the selected tag is applied (or removed), the connected actions will be triggered.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/automators/suretriggers/\#action) Action

WP Fusion can also be used as an action connected to another trigger. The available actions are **Add Tag to User** and **Remove Tag from User**.
