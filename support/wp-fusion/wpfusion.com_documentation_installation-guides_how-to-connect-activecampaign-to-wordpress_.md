In this video, you will learn how to install WP Fusion and set up a direct connection to your ActiveCampaign account.

To get started install and activate the plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion. From the ‘Select Your CRM list’ choose _Active Campaign._

Next, we will need to locate to pieces of information: Your **API URL** and your **API Key**.

To find the API URL login to your ActiveCampaign account, go to ‘Settings’, and click on the ‘Developer’ tab.

Copy the URL and paste it into the API URL field in WP Fusion

The API Key can be found directly below the URL.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/activecampaign2-1024x521.png)

Let’s copy it once more and paste it into the appropriate field.

Finally, click on ‘Connect’.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/activecampaign-settings-1024x646.png)

WP Fusion will now establish a connection to Active Campaign and import your tags and custom fields.

Then click ‘Connect’ to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with ActiveCampaign in real time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with ActiveCampaign, see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using ActiveCampaign tags to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-activecampaign-to-wordpress/\#webhooks) Webhooks

Using webhooks in ActiveCampaign automations, you can automatically sync tag changes and contact updates from ActiveCampaign back to WordPress. You can even import new users based on ActiveCampaign contacts.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ac-import-webhook-with-fallback-1024x1011.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ac-import-webhook-with-fallback.jpg) This ActiveCampaign automation sends a notification and retries the webhook if a user import fails.

For more information, see the documentation on [ActiveCampaign Webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/activecampaign-webhooks/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-activecampaign-to-wordpress/\#site-tracking) Site tracking

WP Fusion includes a copy of the [ActiveCampaign tracking scripts](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/#bento), which can be enabled on the General settings tab.

When site tracking is enabled, any new users, customers, or form submissions will automatically be identified to Bento, and their page views will be tracked.

For more information, see the [Site Tracking documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-activecampaign-to-wordpress/\#event-tracking) Event tracking

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/event-tracking-highlighted-1024x662.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/event-tracking-highlighted.jpg) Events tracked by WP Fusion show up in the activity feed on contact records in supported CRMs. In this case we can see a student’s LearnDash course progress and quiz attempts in real time in ActiveCampaign.

WP Fusion’s [Event Tracking Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/event-tracking-overview/) can send events in real time from supported plugins to Bento. For more information, [see the documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/bento-event-tracking/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-activecampaign-to-wordpress/\#enhanced-ecommerce) Enhanced Ecommerce

WP Fusion’s [Enhanced Ecommerce Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/) (available for Plus and Professional license holders) supports sending ecommerce transaction data as Orders to your ActiveCampaign account for sales made in WooCommerce [and other popular ecommerce plugins](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/#supported-plugins).

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-5-1024x875.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-5.jpg) Deep Data from WooCommerce showing on the contact record in ActiveCampaign[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-with-attributes-773x1024.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ac-deep-data-with-attributes.jpg) Deep Data order showing selected product attributes, with the **Sync Attributes** setting on.

For more information, see the documentation on [ActiveCampaign Enhanced Ecommerce](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/activecampaign-ecommerce/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-activecampaign-to-wordpress/\#accounts) Accounts

In addition to updating contact records and applying tags, WP Fusion can update account records in ActiveCampaign, and associate contacts with accounts. For more information see the [ActiveCampaign Accounts documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/activecampaign-accounts/).

With the recent news that Jilt is shutting down, we’ve been looking around for an abandoned cart recovery option for our Easy Digital Downloads store, and we decided to bring it all “in house” and use WP Fusion’s Abandoned Cart addon with ActiveCampaign (Lite plan) for our cart recovery campaigns.
