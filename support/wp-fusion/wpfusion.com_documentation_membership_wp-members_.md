### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/wp-members/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with the [WP-Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-members/) membership plugin, allowing you to sync user registrations and profile updates to your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/wp-members/\#syncing-custom-fields) Syncing custom fields

Any fields you’ve created on your registration or profile forms will show up under Settings » WP Fusion » Contact Fields, under the WP-Members section header. From here you can associate the WP-Members fields with custom fields in your CRM.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wp-members-fields-1024x171.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wp-members-fields-scaled.jpg)

When a user registers or updates their profile via WP-Members, their data will be synced automatically to your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/wp-members/\#defer-until-activation) Defer until activation

WP-Members allows you to require approval for all new users on your site. In some cases you may want to not send any data to your CRM until a new member is approved by an admin, or the user has confirmed their email address using the [email confirmation feature](https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/docs/plugin-settings/options/#confirm).

To enable this go to Settings » WP Fusion » Integrations, and under the WP-Members Integration header, check the box for **Defer Until Activation**.

When this is enabled no data will be sent to your CRM until the new user has been approved by an administrator or confirmed their email.
