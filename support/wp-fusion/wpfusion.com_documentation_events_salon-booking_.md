### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/salon-booking/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [Salon Booking](https://wordpress.org/plugins/salon-booking-system/) to add customers to your CRM of choice when they make a reservation, and apply tags based on the services booked.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/salon-booking/\#customer-data) Customer Data

With WP Fusion active all new customers will have their name and email address synced to your CRM when they make a new booking.

You can also optionally sync their address and phone number to custom fields by enabling these fields for sync under the **Salon Booking** header in the WP Fusion settings.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/salon-booking/\#applying-tags) Applying Tags

When editing any Salon Booking service or assistant, you’ll see a meta box where you can specify tags to be applied in your CRM when a booking is made for that service or assistant.
