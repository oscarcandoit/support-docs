- How to Connect Emercury to WordPress

In this guide, you will learn how to install Emercury and set up a direct connection to integrate your WordPress website with your Emercury account.

To get started install and activate the plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion.

From the ‘Select Your CRM’ dropdown choose ‘Emercury’.

We will need to enter two pieces of information in the configuration

1. Your ‘Email’
2. Your ‘API Key’

To find your API key in Emercury, log into your account, navigate to the “Preferences” menu, and select “API Keys” – this will display your current API key or allow you to request a new one if needed; you can usually access this option through the cogwheel icon in the top right corner of your dashboard.

[![a screenshot of a websites top navigation bar featuring options: online chat, help, preferences, and logout. with preferences highlighted, a dropdown menu reveals choices like contact info, login info, and more. perfect for wordpress users seeking seamless connect options.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/emercury-preferences-api-keys2.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/emercury-preferences-api-keys2.png)

Copy your Email and API Key, and paste them into the appropriate fields in WP Fusion.

Then click ‘Connect’ to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with Emercury in real time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with Emercury, see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using Emercury tags to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-emercury-to-wordpress/\#webhooks) Webhooks

Using webhooks in Emercury, you can automatically sync tag changes and contact updates from Emercury back to WordPress. You can even import new users based on Emercury contacts.

Webhooks are managed in Emercury under **Settings » Developer**. If you’re already logged into your Emercury account, you should be able to access this page by [following this link](https://panel.emercury.net/#settings/developer/). For an overview of webhooks with Emercury, [see this doc](http://help.emercury.net/en/articles/4900959-outgoing-webhooks).
