### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other/wp-job-manager/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WP Job Manager](https://wpfusion.com/go/wpjobmanager) to add contacts to your CRM when they register to post a job.

You can also optionally apply a tags to users when they post a job. These tags will also be applied when a user registers via the WP Job Manager registration form.

To configure these tags, in the admin, go to Job Listings » Settings, and select the “Job Submission” tab. You’ll see a new field where you can specify what tags should be applied.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other/wp-job-manager/\#job-alerts) Job Alerts

If you’re using the Job Alerts addon you can also tag people when they sign up for a job alert of a certain type.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-job-manager-job-alerts-1024x198.jpg)

To to that, navigate to Job Listings » Job Types and click Edit on any job type. You’ll see a setting like in the screenshot above where you can specify the tags to be applied when an alert is created.
