In this guide, you will learn how to install WP Fusion and set up a direct connection to integrate your WordPress website with your Bento account.

To get started install and activate the WP Fusion plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion.

From the ‘Select Your CRM’ list choose ‘Bento’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bento-configuration-1024x713.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bento-configuration.png)

Enter your Site Unique ID and API Key. Your site unique ID can be found in your Bento account under the Settings » Site UUID. Your API key can be found in your Bento account under Settings » Get your API key here » API Key (Combined).

Then click ‘Connect’ to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with Bento in real time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with Bento, see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using Bento tags to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-bento-to-wordpress/\#webhooks) Webhooks

Using webhooks in Bento automations, you can automatically sync tag changes and contact updates from Bento back to WordPress. You can even import new users based on Bento contacts.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bento-webhook-action-1024x467.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bento-webhook-action.png)

For more information, see the documentation on [Bento Webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/bento-webhooks/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-bento-to-wordpress/\#site-tracking) Site tracking

WP Fusion includes a copy of the [Bento scripts](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/#bento), which can be enabled on the General settings tab.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bento-site-tracking.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bento-site-tracking.png)

When site tracking is enabled, any new users, customers, or form submissions will automatically be identified to Bento, and their page views will be tracked.

For more information, see the [Site Tracking documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-bento-to-wordpress/\#event-tracking) Event tracking

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/event-tracking-bento-1024x502.jpeg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/event-tracking-bento.jpeg)

WP Fusion’s [Event Tracking Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/event-tracking-overview/) can send events in real time from supported plugins to Bento. For more information, [see the documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/event-tracking/bento-event-tracking/).
