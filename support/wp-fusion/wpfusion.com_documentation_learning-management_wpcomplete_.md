### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/wpcomplete/\#overview) Overview

Using WP Fusion and [WPComplete](https://wpcomplete.co/) you can apply tags in your CRM when students mark content as completed, or when they complete entire courses.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/wpcomplete/\#lessons) Lessons

When WPComplete is active, an additional setting will appear at the bottom of the [WP Fusion meta box](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/meta-box/) while editing any post. Here you can specify tags to be applied when all items on the page are marked complete.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/wpcomplete/\#courses) Courses

WP Fusion also adds an admin menu where you can set up tagging for entire courses.

For each WPComplete course you can specify tags to be applied in your CRM when all complete-able items in the course are completed.
