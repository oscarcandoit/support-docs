### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_should_filter_query/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion’s [Filter Queries option](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/#filter-queries) allows you to modify the results of database queries to exclude content that a user can’t access (based on WP Fusion’s access rules).

There are some situations where you may need to bypass query filtering on a specific post type or in a certain context, in that case you can use the `wpf_should_filter_query` filter.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_should_filter_query/\#parameters) Parameters

- `$should_filter` _(bool)_: Whether or not to apply query filtering to the query
- `$query` ( _WP\_Query_): The query

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_should_filter_query/\#examples) Examples

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/filters/wpf_should_filter_query/\#bypass-query-filtering-on-the-home-page-if-the-post-type-is-an-event) Bypass query filtering on the home page if the post type is an event

This example bypasses query filtering on the [The Events Calendar](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/integrations/the-events-calendar-event-tickets/) events list if the current page is the home page.

```php
function bypass_filter_queries_for_events( $should_filter, $query ) {

	if ( is_front_page() && 'tribe_events' == $query->get( 'post_type' ) ) {
		return false;
	}

	return $should_filter;

}

add_filter( 'wpf_should_filter_query', 'bypass_filter_queries_for_events', 10, 2 );
```
