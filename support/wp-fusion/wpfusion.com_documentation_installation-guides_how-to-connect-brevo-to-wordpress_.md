In this guide, you will learn how to install WP Fusion and set up a direct connection to integrate your WordPress website with your Brevo account.

To get started install and activate the WP Fusion plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion.

From the ‘Select Your CRM’ list choose ‘Brevo’.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/brevo-wp-fusion-configuration-1024x628.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/brevo-wp-fusion-configuration.png)

Enter your API key, which can be found in your Brevo account [here](https://account.brevo.com/advanced/api/), and click ‘Connect’ to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with Brevo in real time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with Brevo, see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using Brevo lists to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-brevo-to-wordpress/\#webhooks) Webhooks

Using webhooks in Brevo automation, you can automatically sync list changes and contact updates from Brevo back to WordPress. You can even import new users based on Brevo contacts.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-brevo-to-wordpress/\#site-tracking) Site tracking

WP Fusion includes a copy of the [Brevo tracking scripts](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/#brevo), which can be enabled on the General settings tab.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brevo-site-tracking-1024x234.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brevo-site-tracking.png)

When site tracking is enabled, any new users, customers, or form submissions will automatically be identified to Brevo, and their page views will be tracked.

For more information, see the [Site Tracking documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/site-tracking-scripts/).

WP Fusion’s [Enhanced Ecommerce Addon](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/) (available for Plus and Professional license holders) supports sending ecommerce transaction data as Deals to your Brevo account for sales made in WooCommerce [and other popular ecommerce plugins](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/#supported-plugins).

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brevo-enhanced-ecom-sales-pipelines-1024x535.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brevo-enhanced-ecom-sales-pipelines-scaled.jpg) WooCommerce orders appear as Deals in Brevo sales pipelines[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brevo-enhanced-ecom-single-deal-1-1024x789.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brevo-enhanced-ecom-single-deal-1-scaled.jpg) The single deal view shows the title and value, and the deal description contains a list of purchased products and their prices.
