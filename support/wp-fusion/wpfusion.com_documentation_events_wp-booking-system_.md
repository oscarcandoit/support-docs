### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-booking-system/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WP Booking System](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-booking-system/) to allow you sync event bookings to contact records in your [CRM of choice](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

You can also apply CRM tags and lists based on the booking form used.

WP Fusion supports both the [free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-booking-system/) and [premium](https://wpfusion.com/go/wp-booking-system) versions of the plugin.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-booking-system/\#syncing-bookings) Syncing bookings

First create a calendar and a booking form, and add some fields to the form. Then navigate to Form Options » WP Fusion.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wp-booking-system-1024x822.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wp-booking-system.jpg)

For each field on your form, select a corresponding custom field in your CRM. You can optionally select one or more tags (or lists) to be applied when the form is submitted.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-booking-system/\#how-it-works) How it works

When the booking form is submitted, WP Fusion will sync the form entry to a contact record in your CRM. If a contact already exists with the same email address, it will be updated. If no contact exists, a new contact record will be created. The contact will be tagged with any tags you’ve selected on the form configuration.
