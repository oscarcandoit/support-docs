### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/convert-pro/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion extends [Convert Pro](https://www.convertpro.net/) to allow you to target call-to-actions based on a logged-in user’s tags in your CRM.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/convert-pro/\#setup) Setup

After designing your CTA, navigate to Configure » Target, and expand the WP Fusion section.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/convert-pro-2-1024x633.jpg)

Once you’ve turned on the targeting rule you’ll be able to select a tag in your CRM from the dropdown.

- The default logic is “ _Show only to users who have this tag”._ With this selected, the CTA will only be displayed when a user is logged in and has the selected tag.
- If you set the logic to “ _Hide from users who have the tag”_ the CTA will be shown only to guests and registered users who do _not_ have the specified tag.
