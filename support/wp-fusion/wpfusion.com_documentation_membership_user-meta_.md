### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/user-meta/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [User Meta](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-meta/) to sync new user registrations and profile updates to [your CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/), with support for any number of custom fields.

Any custom fields created on User Meta forms will be displayed in the [Contact Fields tab](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) of the WP Fusion settings.

You can then map these fields to fields in your CRM, and the data will be synced whenever a user registers or profile is updated.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/user-meta/\#global-settings) Global settings

WP Fusion has one global setting for User Meta Pro, which can be found under Settings » WP Fusion » Integrations.

When **Defer Until Activation** is checked, no data will be sent to your CRM until after a new user has either verified their email address or been confirmed by an administrator.
