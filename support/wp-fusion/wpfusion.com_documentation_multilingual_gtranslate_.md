### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/multilingual/gtranslate/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [GTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gtranslate/) to sync a user’s language preference to your CRM.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gtranslate-1024x114.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gtranslate.jpg)

From the Contact Fields tab in the WP Fusion settings, you can enable the `language_code` field for sync.

When a user registers or updates their profile, the selected custom field will be updated in your CRM with their preferred language.

The language preference will also be synced when WP Fusion creates or updates a contact record for a guest, for example via a form submission or guest checkout.
