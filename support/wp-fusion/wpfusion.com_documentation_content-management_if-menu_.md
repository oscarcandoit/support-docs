### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/content-management/if-menu/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [If Menu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/if-menu/) to allow you to use tags or lists from [your connected CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/) as conditions for menu item visibility.

[![If Menu WP Fusion settings](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/if-menu-1024x666.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/if-menu.jpg)

When editing any menu item with If Menu, you can select from three WP Fusion conditions:

- **Required Tags (any):** The menu item only be shown if the user is logged in and has at least one of the specified tags
- **Required Tags (all):** The menu item will only be shown if the user is logged in and has _all_ of the specified tags
- **Required Tags (not):** The menu item will be shown if the user is logged in and has _none_ of the specified tags, or if the user is not logged in.

**Note:** Due to a bug in If Menu, you must first select _Enable Visibility Rules_ and save the menu before the WP Fusion tags select box will appear.
