- Ecommerce Tracking Overview

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion already connects your ecommerce platform [to your CRM](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/), allowing you to create contacts and apply tags when products are purchased, but only contact data is transferred, not the transaction details for each purchase.

Our **Ecommerce Addon**, available to Plus and Professional license holders, builds on this functionality by letting you create separate order records in your CRM’s ecommerce platform, including products purchased, coupons and discounts used, shipping, and taxes.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce-tracking/ecommerce-overview/\#how-it-works) How it Works

Using this addon you can keep track of ecommerce data in your CRM alongside each contact record, allowing for greater flexibility in creating campaigns and automations, as well as using your CRM’s reporting tools to monitor your sales performance.

When a customer checks out, WP Fusion will create an order record and send it to your CRM. If your CRM supports products WP Fusion will also create new product records and add them to the order.

The CRMs supported by Enhanced Ecommerce are listed below. Click on each to learn more about the capabilities of the integration.
