### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/uncanny-learndash-groups/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [Uncanny LearnDash Groups](https://www.uncannyowl.com/downloads/uncanny-learndash-groups/) to give you additional options for tagging your students.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uncanny-learndash-groups-1-1024x588.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uncanny-learndash-groups-1.jpg)

When editing any LearnDash Group Course type product in WooCommerce you’ll see an additional option for _Apply tags when a user is added to this group course_.

Any tags specified here will be applied to the new user when a group leader adds a new student to the course, or when a group leader adds a user to a group license product which contains this course (see below).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/uncanny-learndash-groups/\#pre-configured-group-license-products-and-subscriptions) Pre-configured Group License Products and Subscriptions

Uncanny LearnDash groups also allows you to create [pre-configured group license products](https://www.uncannyowl.com/knowledge-base/creating-pre-configured-learndash-group-licenses/) which can contain multiple group courses.

If you want to apply tags to users when they are added to a group license, independently of the courses in that license (see above), you can also select tags when editing a Group License or Subscription product.
