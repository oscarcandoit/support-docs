- Infusionsoft / Keap HTTP Posts

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/infusionsoft-http-posts/\#overview) Overview

You can use HTTP Posts in Infusionsoft to send data back to your WordPress site using WP Fusion. Using HTTP Posts you can create new users on your WordPress site based on automations in Infusionsoft, or update existing users’ meta data and tags.

Having trouble receiving webhooks? [Check out our troubleshooting guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other-common-issues/webhooks-not-being-received-by-wp-fusion/).

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/infusionsoft-http-posts/\#getting-started) Getting Started

Open a campaign in the Campaign Manager (or create a new one) and create a trigger goal. For example, to trigger WP Fusion to sync a contact when a tag is applied, create an Applies A Tag goal. Then connect the goal to a campaign sequence. In the campaign sequence, add a Send HTTP Post action from the Process menu. In the Post URL field, put the URL to your website, like so:

![new-http-post](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/new-http-post-1024x465.jpg)

There are three methods, **update**, **update\_tags** and **add**. For each you will need to supply your access key, which can be obtained from the bottom of the General tab in the WP Fusion settings:

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/webhooks-access-key-1024x312.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/webhooks-access-key-scaled.jpg)

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/infusionsoft-http-posts/\#to-update-a-users-tags) To update a user’s tags

To update an existing WordPress user’s tags from the contact record, under Name / Value pairs, you should have:

```
contactId = ~Contact.Id~
wpf_action = update_tags
access_key = [your access key]
```

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/infusionsoft-http-posts/\#to-update-a-users-tags-and-meta-data) To update a user’s tags and meta data

To update a user’s tags and pull any new meta data from Infusionsoft for that contact, under Name / Value pairs, you should have:

```
contactId = ~Contact.Id~
wpf_action = update
access_key = [your access key]
```

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/infusionsoft-http-posts/\#create-a-new-user) Create a new user

Using this method, you can register a new user on your website when a contact is created in Infusionsoft. Under Name / Value pairs, you should have:

```
contactId = ~Contact.Id~
wpf_action = add
access_key = [your access key]
```

There are two additional options, which you can leave out if you don’t need them.

```
send_notification = true
role = subscriber
```

If you set `send_notification` to `true`, the user will be sent a welcome email with their username, password, and a link to log in on your site.

You can also set the `role` parameter to assign users a specific role on your site. By default users will be imported with the role set in the WordPress’ Settings >> General “New User Default Role” field, but sometimes you may want to create users with a different role depending on conditions in your campaign sequence.

The add method **will update a user** if an existing user already exists. It will not create a duplicate user.

**Note:** By default, user accounts will be created with their email address as the username and a randomly generated password. However, if you have created a custom username field and password field in Infusionsoft, and enabled these fields in WP Fusion for sync with `user_login` and `user_pass` on your website, the new users will be given the usernames and passwords stored in their Infusionsoft contact record.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/infusionsoft-http-posts/\#user-passwords) User passwords

New user accounts will be created with an automatically generated password. If you’d like to use this password in your email marketing, you can send the password back to Infusionsoft after it has been generated.

In the Webhooks section of the General settings tab, check the box for Return Password, and select a field in Infusionsoft where the password should be stored.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/password-1024x208.png)

After a new user is created, their automatically generated password will now be saved back to their contact record, and you can use a merge field to include it in an email. The username will be the contact’s email address.
