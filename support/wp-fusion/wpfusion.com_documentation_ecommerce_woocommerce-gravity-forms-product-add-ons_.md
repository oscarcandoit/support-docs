### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce-gravity-forms-product-add-ons/\#overview) Overview

Using WP Fusion and the [Gravity Forms Product Add-ons](https://woocommerce.com/products/gravity-forms-add-ons/) extension for WooCommerce, you can collect custom product data and sync it to any one of [50+ supported CRMs and marketing automation systems](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce-gravity-forms-product-add-ons/\#setup) Setup

Setup is simple. First create your product addon forms and [associate them with your products](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-gravity-forms-product-addons/#section-3). Then go to the WP Fusion [Contact Fields settings](https://wpfusion.com/videos/tutorials/mapping-and-syncing-contact-fields/) and scroll down to the WooCommerce Gravity Forms Addons section.

Enable any fields you’d like to sync by selecting a custom field in your CRM from the dropdown in the right column.

When a customer checks out, any enabled custom addon fields will be synced to their corresponding custom fields in your CRM.
