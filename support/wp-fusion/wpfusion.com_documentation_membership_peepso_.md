### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/peepso/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [PeepSo](https://wpfusion.com/go/peepso) to keep members in sync between your membership site and your CRM.

All new users who register via PeepSo will be instantly added to your CRM, with all data provided at registration. Profile updates are also synced.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/peepso-1024x294.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/peepso.jpg)

Any custom fields you add to your PeepSo user profiles (using the Extended Profiles Add-on) will also be detected and will be available for sync in the WP Fusion settings.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/peepso/\#groups) Groups

WP Fusion also integrates with the Groups addon for PeepSo. You can access the Groups settings by clicking WP Fusion in the main PeepSo menu.

![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/peepso-groups-1024x359.jpg)

For each of your groups, you can select a tag to be “linked” with that group. When the tag is applied, the user will be added to the group. When the tag is removed, the user will be removed from the group.
