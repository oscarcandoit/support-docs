### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravityview/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [GravityView](https://wpfusion.com/go/gravityview) to apply tags to contacts in your CRM when Gravity Forms entries are marked approved with GravityView.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravityview/\#setup) Setup

First create a WP Fusion feed for your form using our [Gravity Forms integration](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravity-forms/). When GravityView is active WP Fusion will display a new setting for **Apply Tags – Approved**.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gravityview-1-1024x364.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gravityview-1.jpg)

Here you can specify any tags that should be applied when entries are approved.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravityview/\#usage) Usage

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gravityview-2-1024x515.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gravityview-2.jpg)

When an entry is marked as approved (either a single entry or via bulk edit), WP Fusion will apply the specified tags to the contact record in your CRM that was created during the initial form submission.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravityview/\#gravityedit) GravityEdit

When editing Gravity Forms entries using the [GravityEdit extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/products/gravityview-inline-edit/?ref=554), WP Fusion will automatically sync any updated form entries to the corresponding contact record in your CRM.
