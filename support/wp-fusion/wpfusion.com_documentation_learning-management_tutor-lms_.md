### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/tutor-lms/\#overview) Overview

Using WP Fusion and [Tutor LMS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor/) you can restrict access to courses based on a user’s tags in your CRM, and apply tags when courses are marked complete.

**Note:** Since Tutor LMS 3.0, you will need to temporarily switch your course into Legacy Mode to edit WP Fusion’s course settings.

[![screenshot](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tutor-lms-legacy-mode-300x142.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tutor-lms-legacy-mode.jpg)

You can switch back to the course builder after you’ve configured your access rules and tags.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/tutor-lms/\#content-protection) Content Protection

WP Fusion adds a meta box to every Tutor course where you can restrict access to the course and specify redirects if the user doesn’t have access.

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20290%20620'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tutor-lms.jpg)

For more information see the documentation on the [WP Fusion meta box](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/meta-box/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/tutor-lms/\#tagging) Tagging

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20399'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tutor-lms-2-1-scaled.jpg)

WP Fusion also adds a meta box to every course where you can specify tags to be applied in your CRM when the course is marked complete by the student.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/tutor-lms/\#auto-course-enrollment) Auto course enrollment

Using the **Link with tag** setting you can “link” a tag in your CRM with a TutorLMS course. When this tag is applied, the user will automatically be enrolled in the course. If the tag is removed, the user will be un-enrolled.

Likewise if the user is enrolled in the course (either manually or via a purchase) the linked tag will be applied, and if a user is removed from the course the linked tag will be removed.
