# SureForms

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/forms/sureforms/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [SureForms](https://wpfusion.com/go/sureforms) to sync form submissions to any one of [50+ CRM or marketing automation systems](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/). Using WP Fusion you can add and update contacts when forms are submitted, and also apply tags.

Note that WP Fusion’s SureForms integration requires [SureForms Pro](https://wpfusion.com/go/sureforms-pricing).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/forms/sureforms/\#setup) Setup

First enable the WP Fusion integration globally by going to SureForms » Settings » Integrations. Click Add Integration, and select WP Fusion from the list.

Then, from any single form, navigate to the Single Form Settings, and click on the Integrations tab. Click Create Workflow and select WP Fusion from the list.

[![a website dashboard shows the wp fusion integration setup screen, with options to select a workflow name, choose an action such as sync contact, apply tags, or assign lists, and navigation buttons back and continue.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sureforms-1-1024x734.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sureforms-1.jpg)

Then select an action from the Select Action dropdown:

- **Sync Contact:** Creates or updates a contact in your connected CRM (based on email address)
- **Apply Tags:** Applies one or more tags to a contact based on a form submission
- **Assign Lists:**(where applicable) Applies one or more lists to a contact

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/forms/sureforms/\#sync-contacts) Sync Contacts

[![a wp fusion configuration screen displays input fields for email, account name, first name, last name, phone, and membership expiration date. the wordpress dashboard menu is visible on the left side.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sureforms-3-1024x629.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sureforms-3.jpg)

For each field in your CRM, you can select a corresponding field on the form. When the form is submitted, the selected fields will be synced.
