### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/highlevel-white-labelled-accounts/\#overview) Overview

When using a white-labelled [HighLevel](https://wpfusion.com/go/highlevel) account, it’s also possible to white-label the CRM name in the WordPress admin, or even white-label WP Fusion itself.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/highlevel-white-labelled-accounts/\#white-labelling-the-crm-name-in-wp-fusion) White-labelling the CRM name in WP Fusion

Renaming the CRM in the WP Fuusion UI can be achieved with the [wp\_fusion\_init\_crm action](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/actions/wp_fusion_init_crm/).

```php
function wpf_whitelabel_crm( &$crm ) {
	$crm->name = 'Custom Name';
}

add_action( 'wp_fusion_init_crm', 'wpf_whitelabel_crm' );
```

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/highlevel-white-labelled-accounts/\#change-the-view-in-crm-links) Change the View in CRM links

This example changes the _View in CRM_ links across the WP Fusion UI. The `%s` will be replaced by the contact ID of the relevant contact.

```php
function wpf_rewrite_view_in_crm_links( &$crm ) {
	$crm->edit_url = 'https://app.mybrand.com/v2/location/' . $crm->location_id . '/contacts/detail/%s';
}
add_action( 'wp_fusion_init_crm', 'wpf_rewrite_view_in_crm_links' );
```
