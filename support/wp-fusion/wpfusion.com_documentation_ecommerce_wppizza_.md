### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/wppizza/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WPPizza](https://www.wp-pizza.com/) for adding new customers to your CRM and tagging them based on products purchased.

When a customer places an order via WPPizza they will be added to your selected CRM as a contact.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/wppizza/\#syncing-customer-fields) Syncing customer fields

WP Fusion will automatically detect your WPPizza order form fields, and they will be listed under Settings » WP Fusion » Contact Fields.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wppizza-fields-1024x509.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wppizza-fields.jpg)

For each order form field you can select a corresponding field in your CRM. When a customer places an order the enabled fields will be synced.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/wppizza/\#tagging) Tagging

You can optionally tag your customers based on items they order.

The _Apply Tags_ setting can be found in the **WPPizza** meta box while editing any menu item.
