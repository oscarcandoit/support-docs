### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/wp-user-manager/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with the [WP User Manager](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-manager/) membership plugin, allowing you to sync user registrations and profile updates to your [CRM or email marketing platform](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/wp-user-manager/\#syncing-custom-fields) Syncing custom fields

The primary WP User Manager fields and any fields you’ve created with WP User Manager’s [Custom Contact Fields addon](https://wpusermanager.com/addons/custom-fields/) will appear under Settings » WP Fusion » Contact Fields, under the WP User Manager section header.

From here, you can associate the WP User Manager fields with custom fields in your CRM.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/wp_user_manager_ss_1.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/wp_user_manager_ss_1.jpg)

When a user registers or updates their profile via WP User Manager, their data will be synced automatically to your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/membership/wp-user-manager/\#defer-until-activation) Defer until activation

WP User Manager’s [User Verification addon](https://wpusermanager.com/addons/user-verification/) allows you to require approval or email verification for all new users on your site. In some cases you may want to not send any data to your CRM until a new member is approved by an admin, or the user has confirmed their email address.

To enable this, go to Settings » WP Fusion » Integrations, and under the WP User Manager Integration header, check the box for **Defer Until Activation**.

When this is enabled, no data will be sent to your CRM until the new user has been approved by an administrator or confirmed their email.
