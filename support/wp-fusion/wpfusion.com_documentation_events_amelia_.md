### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/amelia/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes an integration with [Amelia](https://wpfusion.com/go/amelia) to sync event and appointment bookings to [any one of 50+ supported CRMs and marketing automation platforms](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/), and apply tags based on booked services and events.

You can use this data to create segments in your marketing lists or to trigger automations to follow up with customers before and after their appointment time.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/amelia/\#syncing-bookings-and-custom-fields) Syncing bookings and custom fields

WP Fusion makes several Amelia fields available for sync from [the Contact Fields tab](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) in the WP Fusion settings.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amelia-fields-settings-1024x407.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amelia-fields-settings.jpg)

The fields are:

- **Service Name:** The service the customer booked. Will be updated with each booking.
- **Appointment Date / Time:** The date and time of the customer’s booking.
- **Event Name:** The name of the event the customer registered for.
- **Event Date / Time:** The start date and time of the event.
- Any [custom fields](https://wpamelia.com/custom-fields/) created in Amelia.

For each, select a corresponding custom field in your connected CRM to enable it for sync.

When an appointment or event is booked any enabled fields will be synced to the customer’s contact record in your CRM.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/amelia/\#tagging-customers) Tagging customers

WP Fusion provides a few general settings for Amelia. These can be found at Amelia » WP Fusion in your WordPress admin.

[![WP Fusion's Amelia integration event settings](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amelia-services-events-settings-1024x589.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amelia-services-events-settings.jpg) WP Fusion’s Amelia integration allows you to apply tags in your CRM when customers book appointments or register for events.

The options are:

- **Sync Guests:** This setting is enabled by default— anyone who makes an appointment booking via Amelia will have a contact record created (or updated) in your CRM. You can disable Sync Guests if you only want to sync the appointment details for registered users.
- **Apply Tags for Services:** For each service, you can select one or more tags to apply in your CRM when that service is booked.
- **Apply Tags for Events:** For each event, you can select one or more tags to apply in your CRM when an attendee registers for that event.
