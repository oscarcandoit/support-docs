# Popup Maker

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other/popup-maker/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/) to allow you to control the targeting of popups based on a logged in user’s tags. It also allows you to sync entries from popup subscription forms to your CRM of choice.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other/popup-maker/\#popup-targeting) Popup targeting

To configure, first create a popup and navigate to the Targeting tab.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/popup-maker-1024x370.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/popup-maker.jpg)

Add a new condition, select User Tags from the dropdown, and specify one or more tags. The popup will now only be shown to logged in users who have at least one of the tags.

To invert the logic, click the  icon. Now the popup will only be shown to logged in users who _don’t have any of the tags_.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/other/popup-maker/\#subscription-forms) Subscription forms

By default WP Fusion will sync all entries from Popup Maker subscription forms to your connected CRM. To disable this uncheck the option for **Add Contacts** on the Integrations tab in the WP Fusion settings.
