### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/mautic-points/\#overview) Overview

Mautic has a [built-in lead scoring system](https://docs.mautic.org/en/points) called points. While WP Fusion doesn’t have a visual interface for assigning points, it’s pretty easy to do so with a short snippet of custom code.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/mautic-points/\#examples) Examples

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/mautic-points/\#add-ten-points-when-a-form-is-submitted) Add ten points when a form is submitted

This example runs on the [`wpf_forms_post_submission` hook](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/actions/wpf_forms_post_submission/) and adds 10 points to a contact in Mautic after WP Fusion has synced it to Mautic from one of our [supported form integrations](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/#lead-generation).

```php
function add_points_in_mautic( $update_data, $user_id, $contact_id, $form_id ) {

	$points = 10;

	wp_remote_post(
		wp_fusion()->crm->url . "api/contacts/{$contact_id}/plus/{$points}",
		wp_fusion()->crm->get_params()
	);

}

add_action( 'wpf_forms_post_submission', 'add_points_in_mautic', 10, 4 );
```

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/crm-specific-docs/mautic-points/\#add-50-points-when-an-order-is-placed) Add 50 points when an order is placed

By changing the hook to [wpf\_woocommerce\_payment\_complete](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/actions/wpf_woocommerce_payment_complete/), we can likewise assign 50 points after an order has been placed.

```php
function add_points_in_mautic( $order_id, $contact_id ) {

	$points = 50;

	wp_remote_post(
		wp_fusion()->crm->url . "api/contacts/{$contact_id}/plus/{$points}",
		wp_fusion()->crm->get_params()
	);

}

add_action( 'wpf_woocommerce_payment_complete', 'add_points_in_mautic', 10, 2 );
```
