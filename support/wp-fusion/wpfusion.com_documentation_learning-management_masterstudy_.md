### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/masterstudy/\#overview) Overview

Using WP Fusion and [MasterStudy](https://wpfusion.com/go/masterstudy) LMS, you can restrict access to your courses and other content based on a user’s tags in your [CRM or email marketing platform](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/), as well as apply tags based on student progress, and auto-enroll students into courses based on changes in tags.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/masterstudy/\#access-control) Access Control

For more information on controlling access to MasterStudy courses and lessons based on CRM tags, see the documentation on [WP Fusion’s access control features](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/meta-box/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/masterstudy/\#courses-and-lessons) Courses and Lessons

WP Fusion lets you apply tags when students are enrolled into MasterStudy courses, as well as when courses and lessons are marked complete.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/masterstudy/\#course-settings-and-auto-enrollment) Course Settings and Auto-Enrollment

When editing any course, scroll down to the **WP Fusion** meta box to access the WP Fusion settings.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/masterstudy-lms-course-1024x453.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/masterstudy-lms-course.jpg)

The options here are:

- **Apply tags – Enrolled:** These tags will be applied to a user when they are enrolled in the course, either manually, via a free signup, or another plugin integration. They will not be removed if the student is removed from the course, and they do not affect automated enrollments.
- **Link with tag:** Using this setting you can “link” a tag in your CRM with a MasterStudy course. When this tag is applied, the user will automatically be enrolled in the course. If the tag is removed, the user will be un-enrolled. Likewise if the user is enrolled in the course (either manually or via a purchase) the linked tag will be applied, and if a user is removed from the course the linked tag will be removed.
- **Apply Tags – Completed:** These tags will be applied in your CRM when the course is marked complete.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/learning-management/masterstudy/\#lessons) Lessons

The WP Fusion settings for each lesson can be found in the **WP Fusion – Lesson Settings** metabox.

Here you can select one or more tags to apply in your CRM when a student marks a lesson complete.
