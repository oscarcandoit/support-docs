### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravity-pdf/\#overview) Overview

Using the [Gravity PDF](https://gravitypdf.com/) extension for Gravity Forms you can automatically generate PDFs from your Gravity Form entries. WP Fusion can then sync the URL to the PDF to a custom field on the corresponding contact record in your CRM.

For an overview on WP Fusion’s features with Gravity Forms, see [this documentation page](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravity-forms/).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravity-pdf/\#setup) Setup

First configure your PDFs for your form, and then [create a WP Fusion feed](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/lead-generation/gravity-forms/).

Underneath the form field mapping interface will be a heading, **PDF URLs**. For each PDF associated with the form, you can select a corresponding field in your connected CRM.

Now when the form is submitted, WP Fusion will create a contact record in your CRM for the lead, and the URL to the generated PDF will be synced to the selected custom field.
