### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-travel-engine/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion integrates with [WP Travel Engine](https://wptravelengine.com/) to allow you to add event attendees as contacts to your CRM of choice when they book a tour or activity. You can also optionally apply CRM tags based on the event the person registered for.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-travel-engine/\#syncing-contacts-and-custom-fields) Syncing contacts and custom fields

By default WP Fusion will sync each new event registration to your CRM as a contact, with the person’s name and email address provided at registration. If a contact already exists with the same email address they will be updated.

#### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-travel-engine/\#syncing-booking-fields) Syncing booking fields

WP Fusion also makes available some fields related to the booking for syncing to your CRM. These can also be found in the Contact Fields list in the WP Fusion settings.

[![a settings interface for the wp travel engine plugin displaying fields like trip name, trip code, trip duration, trip date, package name, trip price, trip tax, and attendee details with selectable field types.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wp-travel-engine-fields-1024x464.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wp-travel-engine-fields.jpg)

If any of these fields are enabled then WP Fusion will load the values from the event in WordPress and sync it along with the registration data to your CRM. You can then merge the values into emails, or use them in automations (for example to send a reminder a day before an event).

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/wp-travel-engine/\#applying-tags) Applying tags

You can configure tags to be applied in your CRM on a per-trip basis by using the WP Fusion meta box when editing any trip.

[![a website settings page shows options for configuring trip details, including duration, cut off time, age limits, and participant numbers. at the bottom, wp travel engine tags for booked adventure trip and trip booking are set for wp fusion.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wp-travel-engine-booking-settings-1024x728.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wp-travel-engine-booking-settings.jpg)
