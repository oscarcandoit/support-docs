- How to Connect Maropost to WordPress

### Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to install Maropost and set up a direct connection to integrate your WordPress website with your Maropost account.

To get started install and activate the plugin, then navigate to Settings » WP Fusion.

From the ‘Select Your CRM’ dropdown choose ‘Maropost’.

We will need to enter two pieces of information in the configuration

1. Your ‘Account ID’
2. Your ‘API Key’

To find your Account ID in Maropost, simply look at the URL of your Maropost dashboard after logging in. The account ID will be a number following “accounts/” in the URL string – for example, if your URL is “http://app.maropost.com/accounts/1234/dashboard”, your account ID is “1234”.

To find or create a new API key, refer to this guide: https://galaxy.maropost.com/s/article/API-Keys.

Copy the Account ID and API Key, and paste them into the appropriate fields in WP Fusion.

[![screenshot of the wp fusion settings interface on wordpress, displaying api configuration for maropost. it features fields for account id and api key, complemented by a connect button. arrows guide users to input their account id and api key seamlessly.](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/maropost-configuration-1024x614.png)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/maropost-configuration.png)

Then click ‘Connect’ to initialize the connection.

Once the connection is completed, click **Save Changes** below to save the changes.

That’s it! Your site is connected, and new WordPress users and customers will automatically be synced with Maropost in real-time.

- For exporting historical data from before you installed WP Fusion, check out the [Exporting Data guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/tutorials/batch-operations/).
- For mapping and syncing additional custom fields with Maropost, see the [Syncing Contact Fields guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/).
- For using Maropost tags to track activity in WordPress and personalize the user experience, check out the [Working with Tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/working-with-tags/) and [Restricting Access to Content](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/) guides.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/installation-guides/how-to-connect-maropost-to-wordpress/\#webhooks) Webhooks

Using webhooks in Maropost, you can automatically sync tag changes and contact updates from Maropost back to WordPress. You can even import new users based on Maropost contacts.

For more information, see the documentation on [Maropost Webhooks](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/webhooks/maropost/).
