### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/woocommerce-bookings/\#overview) Overview

WP Fusion includes a basic integration with [WooCommerce Bookings](https://wpfusion.com/go/woocommerce-bookings) that allows you to sync a customer’s booking date and time to a custom field in your CRM.

You can then use this to send emails and other automated engagements before and after a customer’s booking date.

### [\#](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/events/woocommerce-bookings/\#setup) Setup

Setup is straightforward, when WooCommerce Bookings is active, a **Booking Date** field will appear for sync on the [Contact Fields](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/syncing-contact-fields/) tab in the WP Fusion settings.

[![](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wc-bookings-1024x310.jpg)](https://wpfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wc-bookings.jpg)

When this field is enabled for sync, the customer’s booking date and time will be synced to the selected custom field in your CRM after checkout.

For applying tags based on the purchased product and other settings, see the [WooCommerce integration documentation](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/ecommerce/woocommerce/).
