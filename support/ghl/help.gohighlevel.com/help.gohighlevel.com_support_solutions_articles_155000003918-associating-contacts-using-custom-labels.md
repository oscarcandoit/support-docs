# **What Are Contact Associations?**

Contact Associations enable structured relationships between contacts and objects in HighLevel CRM. Instead of managing disconnected profiles, associations provide clear connections between related entities, such as spouses, managers, employees, or linked objects.

#### **Types of Association Labels**

- **Single Label:** A label that applies to both contacts in the association (e.g., “Colleague”).
- **Pair Labels:** Distinct labels for each contact in the relationship (e.g., “Manager” and “Employee,” “Buyer” and “Seller”).

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Contact Associations**

- **Improved Contact Organization:** Associations provide a structured way to manage relationships between contacts, making it easier to track connections and access relevant information in one place.

- **Streamlined Communication:** By linking related contacts, businesses can quickly reference and reach out to connected individuals, ensuring smoother interactions and improved collaboration.

- **Enhanced Relationship Management:** Whether it’s family connections, business partnerships, or internal hierarchies, associations help businesses understand and manage relationships effectively.

- **Efficient CRM Workflow:** With clear associations in place, users can reduce duplicate data entry, quickly update linked contacts, and maintain a well-organized CRM system.

* * *

## **Where to View Contact Associations**

Contact associations can be accessed in two main areas:

- **Contact Profile View:** Within a contact’s profile, the right-side panel contains the Associations icon, which displays related objects and linked contacts.

- **Objects Management Section:** The Settings > Objects > Contacts section provides an overview of all associations, enabling the creation and management of labels and relationships.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. What is the difference between Single and Pair Labels?**

Single Label: Both contacts receive the same label (e.g., "Colleague").

Pair Labels: Each contact has a distinct role in the relationship (e.g., "Manager" and "Employee").

**Q. Can contacts be linked to custom objects?**

Yes, contacts can be associated with predefined objects such as Surfboards, with additional custom object support expected in future updates.

**Q. Can an association label be deleted?**

Yes, but deleting a label is permanent and requires removing all linked associations first.

**Q. How many associations can a single contact have?**

A contact can have up to 10 associations, and one label can link up to 1000 contacts.
