# Workflows Version History & Restore

Modified on: Mon, 13 Oct, 2025 at 8:23 AM

Use **Version History** to review past versions of a workflow and **restore** any version **as a new draft,** your live workflow doesn’t change until you **Publish**. This follows the same draft → publish model used across Workflow.

## What’s included

**Version History Revamp**

- Every saved version now captures your workflow at a specific point in time — including editor, timestamp, and workflow status (Draft or Published).
- Easily browse up to 10 versions or 30 days of version history, organized and filterable by editor.

**Restore Previous Versions**

- Click Restore beside any version to reopen it as a new draft.
- You can even create a new workflow from a previous version.

**Enhanced Browsing Experience**

- The new Version History Sidebar gives a clean, chronological overview with quick filters and clear version labels (v12, v13, v14…).
- Find exactly what you need — no guesswork, no clutter.

- ![Preview/diff example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055806354/original/0uO0ZlcWZwrrra_LfgDidrmo_5RUZR7f6g.jpeg?1760299616)

## How Version History is created

Version History automatically records versions at key moments:

- When you **click Save** manually

- When you confirm changes in the **Unsaved Changes** pop-up

- When you use **Save Version** in the workflow

- When the workflow **status changes** (e.g., Draft → Publish or Publish → Draft)


**Auto Save note:** routine auto-saves do **not** create new versions by themselves.

To capture your current state **as a version**, click **Save Version**—this snapshots your latest auto-saved changes into Version History.

![Save Version entry points](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055806352/original/BqVin7sCENUemT_D8CXdlkLQVem4V8ARfQ.png?1760299616)![Unsaved changes confirmation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055806350/original/7UOEVmXVHj6_yTva7syX4imNoUyTBVhm2w.png?1760299614)

* * *

## Browse versions

Open **Version History** to see your saved entries, organized by **time** and **editor**.

Each entry shows:

- **Workflow name**

- **Version number** (e.g., v12, v13, v14)

- **Timestamp**

- **Editor**

- **Status** (Draft or Published)


![Version list](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055806353/original/Zh9jqSy76VMW90Wdk0flXHA5YcXmoPSd3g.png?1760299616)

You can:

- **Filter by editor**

- View **up to 10 versions or 30 days** of history (whichever comes first)


## Restore or create from a version

- Click **Restore** next to any previous version to reopen it **as a new draft**.

- Your **Published** workflow remains unchanged until you **Publish** the restored draft.

- Or choose **Create new workflow from version** to branch into a separate workflow without touching the original.


![Restore / create new workflow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055806351/original/WmVJgFaaL_TjRFCWroB4shAt4Wt6MKSnfQ.png?1760299615)

**When restoring:**

- The workflow must be in **Draft**.

- There must be **no enrolled contacts** currently in the workflow.

- The restored state becomes a **new version**—all prior versions remain available.


* * *

## How to use it (step-by-step)

1. Open a workflow and click the **Version History** icon in the sidebar.

2. Browse saved versions by **timestamp** and **editor**.

3. Click **Save Version** to snapshot your current auto-saved state.

4. Select any version → **Preview** (and **Compare**, if supported).

5. Click **Restore** to create a **new draft**, or **Create new workflow from version** for branching.

6. Test your draft and **Publish** when you’re ready.


* * *

## Best practices

- **Name versions** at milestones (e.g., “Added enterprise branch,” “Updated welcome sequence”).

- **Coordinate editors**—use **Save Version** before large changes.

- Use **Preview / Compare** to validate differences before restoring.

- **Branch safely** with **Create new workflow from version** when you want to explore big ideas without touching the current build.


* * *

## Notes & limitations

- **Draft → Publish:** Restoring creates a **new draft**. You must **Publish** to push it live.

- **Undo/Redo resets after restore.** Once you restore a version, your session history starts fresh from that draft.

- **Auto Save scope:** Auto Save covers **canvas** edits; some configuration panel edits may still require their own save/apply (v1).

- **Retention:** Version History keeps **up to 10 versions or 30 days**

- **Validation to restore:** Workflow must be **Draft** with **no enrolled contacts**.

- **Availability:** At launch, **Version History** is available via **Labs Beta**. Enable it in **Settings → Labs** for your account.
