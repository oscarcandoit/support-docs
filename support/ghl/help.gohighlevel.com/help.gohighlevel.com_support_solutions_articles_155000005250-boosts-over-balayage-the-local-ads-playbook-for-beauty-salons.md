# Boosts Over Balayage: The Local Ads Playbook for Beauty Salons

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 3:23 AM

## **Why Ads Work for Salons — When They’re Done Right**

A beautiful Instagram feed is great. But it’s not enough to consistently bring new clients in the door. The truth? Organic reach is down, algorithms are moody, and most of your dream clients don’t even follow you yet.

Paid ads let you show up _exactly when someone is searching_ — for a facial before a wedding, a quick root touch-up before the weekend, or a salon that just feels more “them.”

But you don’t need to spend thousands or be a media buyer. You just need one high-converting ad setup — tailored to the way salons actually operate.

This playbook gives you that, step by step.

> **78% of U.S. beauty clients who found a new stylist or salon in the past 12 months said they _first discovered them through a social media ad_ or search engine result.**

## **Step 1: Decide on Your Offer First, Not Your Budget**

Before you think about ad spend, get your offer right. The better your offer, the less you have to spend to get results.

### Winning Salon Offer Ideas:

- $49 signature facial for first-time clients

- Free hair consultation + $20 off your first service

- Bridal trial makeup for $75 (limited slots)

- Book a hair spa and get a free brow wax


Your offer should be:

- **Specific** (Not “10% off everything” — try “$30 off your first balayage session”)

- **Time-sensitive** (“This week only” or “Next 10 bookings”)

- **Easy to claim** (no logins, no complicated forms)


* * *

## **Step 2: Build a Simple Funnel to Capture Leads**

Every ad must connect to a funnel — not your homepage.

Here’s what your funnel should include:

1. A short, visually clean landing page with your offer

2. A 3–4 field lead form (name, phone, service interest)

3. A thank-you page that pushes toward booking or calling

4. A follow-up workflow that sends an SMS and email


This system turns curiosity into an actual booking.

* * *

## **Step 3: Set Up Facebook & Instagram Ads for Local Reach**

Inside Meta Ads Manager (or directly from GHL if synced), here’s how to start:

### Campaign Objective:

- Use **Leads** or **Traffic** if linking to a landing page

- Use **Messages** if sending people to DM your page


### Targeting:

- **Location**: Set a 2–5 mile radius around your salon

- **Age**: Target typical buyer age ranges (e.g. 25–45)

- **Gender**: Optional based on service (e.g. bridal ads)

- **Interests**: Beauty salons, skincare, wedding planning, salon services


### Ad Budget:

- Start with $10–$20 per day

- Let it run for 3–5 days before adjusting based on results

* * *

## **Step 4: Create Scroll-Stopping Ad Creatives**

### Visuals that work for salons:

- Before and afters (face, hair, brows)

- Short video clips of services in action

- Testimonials or selfies from happy clients

- Close-up skin glow shots or styled hair looks


Use high contrast, natural light, and bold text overlays (but keep it platform-native).

### Ad Copy Template:

“Want glowing skin in under 60 minutes? Book our signature facial for just $49. First-time clients only. 10 slots left this week. Tap to claim your glow-up.”

Make it short, benefit-driven, and easy to act on.

> **Facebook ad creatives with before-and-after visuals see up to 38% higher conversion rates for local service businesses.**

* * *

## **Step 5: Automate the Follow-Up (Most Salons Miss This)**

Once someone clicks or submits your ad form, your follow-up decides whether they actually book.

Inside GHL Workflows:

- **Trigger**: New lead from Facebook or landing page

- **Step 1**: Instant SMS — “Thanks for claiming our facial offer! Tap here to book your slot before they fill.”

- **Step 2**: Email with service details and team intro

- **Step 3**: 24-hour reminder with limited-slot urgency


This is where your ad spend becomes revenue.

**[Workflows Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001254-workflow-builder-walkthrough)**

* * *

## **Step 6: Track What’s Working (and What’s Not)**

### Use the Opportunities Pipeline:

- Create a new pipeline stage like “Ad Leads - Facial Promo”

- Move leads as they book, no-show, or convert

- Add tags like “FB Lead - Bridal” or “$49 Facial” to segment performance


Use these metrics to track ROI:

- Cost per lead (from Meta)

- Booked appointments from ad source

- Total revenue generated per campaign


> **Businesses that track leads through CRM pipelines close up to 45% more appointments than those who don’t.**

* * *

## **Final Words: Great Ads Bring Traffic. Great Systems Convert It.**

You don’t need to be everywhere. You just need one great ad, one irresistible offer, and one solid funnel behind it.

Let your competition keep boosting random posts. You’re building a system that works.
