## **What is Snapshot Asset Linking?**

Snapshot Asset Linking allows you to manually control which assets (like workflows, funnels, forms, and more) are included when you push a snapshot. Instead of automatically including everything, you now have full visibility into linked and unlinked assets—giving you the power to decide exactly what travels with each snapshot deployment.

## **Key Benefits of Snapshot Asset Linking**

Easily streamline and customize your snapshots by managing asset inclusion. This feature enhances precision and avoids clutter in your sub-accounts.

- Select only the assets you want to push

- Prevent outdated, unused, or irrelevant assets from being copied

- View enabled (linked) and disabled (unlinked) assets at a glance

- Ensure cleaner deployments and reduce manual cleanup

- Make snapshot management more scalable and repeatable

- Increase confidence in what’s being pushed to client or internal accounts


## **How To Manage Linked Assets in Snapshots**

Learn how to use the updated Snapshot interface to control which assets get included—step by step.

1. **Go to**Account Snapshots

2. Click on **My Snapshots**

3. Find the snapshot you want to manage and click the **three-dot menu** (More Actions)

4. Select **Edit Snapshot**

5. Use the new UI to review and toggle assets:

   - **Enabled assets** will be pushed

   - **Disabled assets** will not be included
6. Click **Save** once your selections are complete


## **Where to Find the Feature**

Use this navigation path to quickly access the new asset control interface.

> **Path**: Account Snapshots → My Snapshots → More Actions (three dots) → Edit Snapshot

## **Why This Feature Matters**

Before this update, pushing a snapshot was often an “all-or-nothing” process. That created room for error and added cleanup steps. With this new control, users can push precisely what they need—no more, no less. It saves time, reduces confusion, and boosts accuracy for agencies managing multiple accounts or templates.

Whether you’re launching a new client or maintaining your template library, this feature ensures your snapshots are as lean and clean as you need them to be.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I edit assets after a snapshot has been pushed?**

You can’t directly edit a pushed snapshot, but you _can_ create a new version or update it with changes.

**Q: What happens if I unlink an asset—will it delete from existing sub-accounts?**

No. Unlinking only affects what’s included in future snapshot pushes. It won’t impact already-deployed assets.

**Q: Is this available for system-provided snapshots?**

This feature is currently available for user-created snapshots. System snapshots are not editable.

**Q: Do I need to save changes after editing linked assets?**

Yes. Be sure to click **Save** to lock in your asset selections.

**Q: Can I filter or search for specific assets when editing?**

Yes. The UI includes filter and search tools to help you find what you need quickly.

### **Next Steps**

- Visit your snapshot list and review current linked assets

- Unlink any assets you don’t want to include in your next push

- Create a test push to validate new settings

- Explore how snapshot versioning can help you manage updates across clients
