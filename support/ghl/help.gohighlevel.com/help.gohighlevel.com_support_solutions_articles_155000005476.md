# How to Reach Out to Prospect Leads Generated via the Prospecting Tool

Modified on: Fri, 13 Jun, 2025 at 8:22 AM

When you generate leads through the **Prospecting Tool** in GoHighLevel — whether through **AI**, **manual search**, or the **Prospecting widget** — those prospects are automatically added to your **Contact List** inside the **Sub-Account CRM**. This allows you to seamlessly begin your outreach efforts through email, SMS, or workflows.

This guide walks you through how to find these leads, engage with them, and leverage GoHighLevel’s CRM to convert them into clients.

* * *

## Where Can You Use Prospecting?

Prospecting is available in **two areas**:

- **Agency View** – for lead discovery and basic prospecting

- **Sub-Account View** – for **advanced engagement and automation**


> **Only Sub-Accounts** can send emails, SMS, and run workflows. That’s why prospecting efforts are most powerful when done (or migrated) inside a sub-account.

How to enable Prospecting in Sub Account

1. If you already have an active Prospecting Subscription at Agency
1. You can [Link a sub account](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005459-how-to-link-a-sub-account-with-your-agency-prospecting-premium-subscription) with it to get access
2. And then [Migrate the Prospects](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005463-how-to-migrate-prospects-from-agency-to-sub-account) to that Sub Account (it will automatically copy them to your contacts, and triggers workflow if any)
3. Go to that sub account and find Prospecting inside the Marketing Tab
2. If you want it for more than one sub account
1. Go to [Reselling Tab](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004341-how-to-resell-and-use-prospecting-tool-for-sub-accounts) inside Agency View
2. Toggle ON Prospecting Tab
3. If you already have a sub account
1. You can simply [migrate prospects](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005463-how-to-migrate-prospects-from-agency-to-sub-account) from Agency to Sub Account (it will automatically add them to your contacts, and triggers workflow if any)

* * *

## How Prospects Are Added to Your Contact List

This is possible when Prospecting done in Sub Account level

No manual setup needed — **prospects are automatically added to your Contacts** in a sub-account when they are generated via:

- [AI-Generated Prospecting](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005148-step-by-step-how-to-generate-prospects-by-ai)

- Manual Google Business Search

- Embedded Prospecting Widget on your site


This means you can immediately:

- Start email/SMS outreach

- Add them to your CRM pipelines

- Migrating (Copying) from Agency to a Sub Account


While generating a new prospect - you will also get notified for this![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047915821/original/bIf7Nb3BbWW35G35dBF3lMSChwqzubMiRg.png?1749408585)

## What If a Prospect Doesn't Appear in Contacts?

In rare cases, due to temporary sync delays or interruptions, a prospect may **not appear** automatically in Contacts.

### Here’s What You Can Do:

- **Manually create a contact** using the details from the Prospecting Tool

- Tag them as `New Prospect Received` to stay consistent

- Add them to workflows or pipelines as needed


> ? Tip: Always check if Prospecting is **enabled** and active in the sub-account. Only then will prospects sync properly to CRM.

* * *

## Pro Tips

- Create **automated workflows** that trigger when new prospects are added (using the “New Prospect Received” tag).

- Use **Smart Lists** in Contacts to segment and track performance by prospect source.

- Include **AI message suggestions** directly in SMS/email outreach for faster follow-ups. (Coming Soon)
