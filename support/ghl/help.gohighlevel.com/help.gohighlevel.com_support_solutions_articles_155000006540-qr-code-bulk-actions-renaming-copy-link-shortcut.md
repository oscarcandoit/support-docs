# **Overview of QR Codes Bulk Actions, Renaming & Copy Link Shortcut**

HighLevel’s QR Code Bulk Actions & Quick Management features adds multi-select workflows (move, delete, download), inline editing, and instant link sharing to the QR Codes List Page. By surfacing core tasks in one toolbar, teams can maintain huge code libraries without opening each QR code individually.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of QR Code Bulk Actions**

- **Time Savings:** Select many items and complete common tasks (move, download, delete) in one go.

- **Fewer Clicks:** Rename QR Codes and folders directly from the list view, no page changes required.

- **Faster Sharing:** Copy Link from any QR Code page without clicking into the specific QR Code.

- **Smarter Exports:** Download as **PNG, SVG, or PDF**; large batches are zipped asynchronously for reliable delivery.


* * *

## **Selecting QR Codes in Bulk**

Selection enables the bulk toolbar. Choose specific QR Codes or select all visible to run a mass action.

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to QR Codes

From the sub-account dashboard, go to **Sites** → **QR Codes**

#### **Step 2:** Enable Select

Click **Select** (top right) to enable checkboxes on each card.

#### **Step 3:** Select QR Codes

Check the items you want to manage. A counter (e.g., **“3 Selected”**) appears with bulk action icons in the top-right corner.

PNG, SVG, or PDF. Large batches are delivered as ZIP files.

**Q: Is delete permanent?**
