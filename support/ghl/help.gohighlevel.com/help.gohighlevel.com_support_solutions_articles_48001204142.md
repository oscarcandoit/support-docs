If you are on **Version 2** of the page builder **[click here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204216)**

## **How Authorization works:**

- This, by default, is **not** turned on and will require a couple of quick extra steps, covered below.
- The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorized amount" from the client's bank account before crediting it later.
- If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
- Upon authorization approval, the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
- If you have any "Trial days" attached to the plan, those will kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
- Funds may take up to 5 business days before being returned to the clients bank account.
- It **ONLY** works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.


**Note:**

```
If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.
```

## **Authorizing a payment using version 1 of the page builder**

**1\. Head into your funnel/ website builder**

Select the funnel step your products are attached to.

![Head into your funnel/ website builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48169672788/original/l8GQglGuJt3NPHjETWSy2omUIINM88u38w.png?1639164055)

**2\. Click on Products**

![Click on Products](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170294110/original/dCwuHTpl0LNldTH6I2ddx6tsKKqWeEdoKQ.png?1639418585)

**3\. Click on the "Edit" icon to open up your product settings**

In this example, there are two plans where "Authorized payments" will need to be turned on (Monthly $149 & Yearly $1490).

First, we will start with plan 1 (Monthly $149) then come back and repeat this process for plan 2 (Yearly plan $1490).

![Click on "Edit" icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48169264569/original/eq8HbysR5MrGBCRiyc94ySS7bduxPM0vuw.png?1639079911)

**4\. Click on Authorize Card**

![Click on Authorize Card](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48169264570/original/mjPTbeR8JIFf7RsfkK5LPDoFmRlUY1Jtjw.png?1639079912)

**5\. Type the dollar amount you would like to "authorize."**

**Please Note:**

```
Keep in mind the amount you place here will be deducted from the clients account. If the funds are unavailable they will not be able to proceed.

In this example: The system will take "$1" out of the clients account and then refund the "$1" back.

The refund process may take up to 5 business days before returning the amount taken.

ONLY works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.
```
