We’re excited to bring you some self help options in this release that will make your communities experience better.

## **New Features:**

- **Transfer Ownership:** Now owner of the group can transfer the ownership to other members of the agency who have access to the location.
  - Example Use Case: My business focuses on building community groups on behalf of clients and then transferring ownership to them. This way, the clients become the owners of the groups, and my name does not appear as creator.
- **Login As:** As an agency or account user/owner, you can now login into a group as a specific contact from the list of associated contacts for an agency user
  - The contacts list will be shown when there are more than 1 contacts associated with an agency/location user.
  - Clicking on any contact from the list will log in to the group as that specific contact.

- **Contact links:** Clicking on the Owner name in the group card will open the contact smartlist page for the owner.
