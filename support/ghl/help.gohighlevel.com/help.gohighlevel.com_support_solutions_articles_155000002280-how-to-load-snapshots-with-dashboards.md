# Important Notes:

```
Include Linked Assets: Dashboards are loaded with all widgets, conditions, filters, and custom widgets. However, make sure to include other assets linked to dashboard widgets (e.g., custom values and pipelines). Failure to do so may result in an error message on specific dashboards, indicating missing properties. Edit each highlighted widget to correct the properties and save to remove the error.
