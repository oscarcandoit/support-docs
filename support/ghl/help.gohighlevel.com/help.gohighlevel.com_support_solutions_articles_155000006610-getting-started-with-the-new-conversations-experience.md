HighLevel’s redesigned Conversations experience delivers a faster, clearer inbox with four flexible panels, upgraded filtering (including tags + AND/OR), and a modern email composer. Teams can triage, collaborate, and act without leaving the thread. This article explains what’s new and how it helps.

# **What is the New Conversations Experience?**

The Conversations module has been completely redesigned to offer a faster, more intuitive, and user-friendly experience. Every element of the interface has been refined for clarity and responsiveness, allowing teams to manage messages, collaborate, and access context seamlessly. The new design introduces significant performance improvements, advanced filtering options, and a refreshed email composer for a smoother, more efficient communication experience.

The redesign introduces a four‑panel layout, a unified right panel for contact context, advanced filtering (tags + AND/OR), and an upgraded email composer that supports full‑screen drafting or inline replies.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the New Conversations Experience**

Understanding the benefits helps admins and agents decide when to enable the new UI and how to use it day‑to‑day to move faster with higher accuracy.

- **Performance improvements:** Measurable gains across the module.

- **Better responsiveness:** Actions now respond ~70% faster, meeting Google’s “good” web‑vital benchmarks.

- **Quicker navigation:** Page navigation is ~35% faster.

- **Lower memory usage:** Memory consumption is reduced by ~18%, improving performance across all devices.

- **Single‑screen context:** Contact details, documents, payments, and activities live alongside the thread for fewer clicks.

- **Precision filtering:** Tags plus AND/OR operators create focused queues you can save as views for one‑click access.

- **Flexible composing:** Full‑screen email for long drafts; inline replies for quick responses.

- **Built‑in collaboration:** Internal comments and @mentions keep team discussion private and organized.


* * *

## **Navigation and Layout**

The redesigned Conversations module introduces a four-panel layout for improved organization and clarity. These panels are collapsible, so you can adjust your workspace based on your preference:

- To collapse or expand the Inbox Panel, click the collapse icon located in the middle of the left panel.

- To collapse or expand the Right Panel, click the tab icon on the right edge of the screen.


This flexibility helps you create more reading or reply space when needed.

* * *

## **1\. Inbox Panel**

The Inbox Panel controls which set of conversations you’re viewing—personal, team, or internal chat—so you can switch context quickly without changing pages.

- **My Inbox:** Conversations assigned to you or followed by you.

- **Team Inbox:** All conversations within the account (requires full data access).

- **Internal Chat:** Private, team‑only discussions separate from customer threads.


**Access notes:**

- Accounts with **Assigned Data Access** see **My Inbox** and **Internal Chat** (not Team Inbox).

- Users with **full access permissions** can view/manage all three


## ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055796068/original/8NSBBrzFTrqGnX2JjbLZDnxGz0c68roX7Q.png?1760268752)        **2.** **Chat List Panel**

The **Chat List Panel** is the second column in the Conversations layout. It displays a list of all conversations based on the inbox, folder, or filter you’ve selected from the **Inbox Panel**. The Chat List Panel shows the threads matching your current inbox, folder, or saved view so you can scan, select, and take bulk actions quickly.

- Check the **select box** at the top to enable bulk actions: **Mark as Read/Unread, Star/Unstar, Delete**.

- **Sort** by newest/oldest activity.

- Use the **Filter** icon for channel, tags, owner, and date filters—supports **AND/OR** combinations.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055796164/original/c3-8C6XXjN8GDG7WJJgU52kCXKltObRSWw.png?1760269005)

## **3\. Message History Panel**

The Message History Panel is your main reading and reply area. It supports multi‑channel timelines, quick replies, and message‑type filtering to find context fast.

- Read the full history across **Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook/Instagram messages**, and **Internal Comments**.

- Filter the visible timeline to focus on specific items (see next section).


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055797000/original/WGxtQKz7Y5Jgsu9pEe5MNqKiNRVwe7un0A.png?1760270999)

### **Switching Between Channels**

Choose the best channel for each reply without leaving the thread—ideal for moving a conversation from SMS to email, or adding internal notes.

- Open the **channel selector** in the composer to switch between available channels.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055677637/original/OGzVi-Ns_g9vPzAJNLWHueH3gmLwZeCqpQ.png?1760083242)

- Select **Internal Comment** to add a private note (customer will not be notified).


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055796343/original/j94tRJSP7McQdsbIpToJmsrCWW_1GUEKGg.png?1760269401)

### **Message Composer**

The composer provides the tools to write clearly, attach files, and send through the correct channel—all from the bottom of the conversation.

- Text formatting and Inline Reply Composer opens directly below the active message, keeping context visible while replying.

- Full-screen mode for long replies

- File attachments and links

- Quick send using the **send icon** on the right

- Replies send via the **selected channel** in the composer


### **Filtering Messages Within a Conversation**

Timeline filters help you isolate specific parts of a long thread—like only emails, only internal notes, or only activities—so you can find context quickly.

Use the **message filter** at the top‑right of the timeline to show:

- **All** messages

- **Conversations** (direct exchanges with the contact)

- **Activities** (appointments, updates, etc.)

- **Email / Internal Comment / Contacts / Opportunities / Payments / Invoices / AI Action Logs**


Use the **search bar** within the filter menu to locate message or activity types faster.

#### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055677689/original/eKeRAWzsFXNOLfRhvW95-3xeHQq64PBliA.png?1760083279)

## **4\. Right Panel**

The Right Panel centralizes contact context so you can view and edit details, files, payments, and related records without leaving the conversation. Everything that was available on the **Contacts page** \- including **custom fields**, **folders**, and **actions** — is now integrated into this panel, giving you full control and visibility while chatting with a customer.

What you can do from the Right Panel:

- View and edit **contact fields**, **custom fields**, **folders**, **tags**, and **owner**

- Create/view **opportunities**, **appointments**, **invoices**, and **payments**

- Switch tabs such as **Contact**, **Activities**, **Associations**, **Documents**, and **Payments**


**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055796618/original/cx4q0OYagUcfF1U9ef_L3lODvi4xM8gY_A.png?1760270139)**

* * *

## **Tags Filter**

You can now filter conversations based on **tags**, allowing precise segmentation by category or workflow.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055796705/original/UO3CI3RCpaDvaHmMYM6gtw7HetE_qB77Ig.png?1760270333)

**Examples:**

- View all conversations tagged as _High Priority_

- See all leads marked with _Follow-up Required_

- Multiple tags can be applied simultaneously for refined control.


* * *

## **AND / OR Operators**

The new filtering system supports **conditional operators**, giving you flexibility to combine multiple criteria:

- Use **AND** to display conversations that meet _all_ selected conditions.


> Example: Conversations tagged _High Priority_ **AND** assigned to you.

- Use **OR** to display conversations that meet _any_ of the selected conditions.


> Example: Conversations from _Email_ **OR** _WhatsApp_ channels.


This makes it easier to build complex filters that match your specific workflow — from isolating urgent support requests to reviewing multi-channel campaigns.

* * *

## **Email Composer Enhancements**

The email composer in the redesigned Conversations module has been upgraded for a clearer, smoother, and more flexible writing experience.

### **Full-View Composer**

You can now expand the composer into a **full-view layout** to draft longer or more detailed emails comfortably.

This provides more space for formatting, adding attachments, and reviewing your message before sending.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055678083/original/Jw_lgWLYI3JEo7L5Wp6jisxxnD9-SOOyZA.png?1760083514)

### **Inline Reply Experience**

When replying to an existing email thread, the composer automatically opens **directly below the active email**.

This layout keeps the context visible while you type, helping you stay focused on the conversation history.

To close or exit the reply composer, click the **delete icon (?)** on the right side of the composer toolbar.

* * *

## **Keyboard Shortcuts**

Keyboard shortcuts speed up navigation and replies. Open the shortcut panel anytime to discover available actions and, where supported, customize mappings.

- **⌘/Ctrl + K** — Global search

- **⌘/Ctrl + Enter** — Send message

- **⌘/Ctrl + Shift + E** — Toggle full‑screen composer

- Press **?** in Conversations to open the full shortcut list

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do my saved replies, templates, and signatures carry over?**

Yes. Existing canned responses, templates, and signatures continue to be available in the new composer.

**Q: Can I customize keyboard shortcuts?**

Press **?** to open the shortcut list and is not customisable.

**Q: Are filters available for all channels, and can I filter by channel?**

Yes. Use the Filter icon to include/exclude channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.). Combine with tags and owners using AND/OR.

**Q: Can teams share Saved Views created from filters?**

Saved Views can be created for quick access. Sharing/visibility depends on your workspace configuration and permissions.

**Q: Does the new experience change workflow automations or triggers?**

No. Workflows and campaign triggers tied to Conversations continue to function as before.

**Q: Where do I find Internal Comments and mentions?**

Choose **Internal Comment** from the channel selector to add a private note and use **@mentions** to notify teammates.
