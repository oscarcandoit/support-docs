Manual Sale Attribution empowers admins to credit affiliates for sales, even when affiliate links weren’t used or the sales occurred offline. This feature is invaluable for attributing sales manually in scenarios such as offline transactions, missed affiliate links, or special campaigns.

## **What is Manual Sale Attribution?**

This feature allows admins to assign sales manually to affiliates, giving them full control over sales attribution, whether the sale was made offline, the affiliate link wasn’t used, or the sale needs to be manually tracked. It provides flexibility in attributing sales, making sure affiliates are rewarded for all sales they influence.

* * *

## **Key Use Cases:**

1. **Offline Sales**: Affiliates promoting products through events, conferences, or offline marketing campaigns.
2. **Untracked Sales**: Sales where the affiliate link was not used, but the customer was referred by an affiliate.
3. **Customer Referrals**: Sales made via word-of-mouth recommendations, without the affiliate link being clicked.

* * *

## **How to Attribute Manual Sales to Affiliates**

There are three primary ways to manually attribute sales and commissions to affiliates:

### 1\. **Using Existing Transactions**

If a transaction already exists in the system, you can manually link it to an affiliate:

- **Step 1**: Access the Affiliate Manager.
- **Step 2**: Select the affiliate profile and go to the Commissions tab.
- **Step 3**: Click "Add Sales Manually" and choose "Import Existing Transaction."![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804699/original/1R29dX16p_xGCEhboo2w1sl265Y69X3Xsg.jpeg?1727703360)

- **Step 4**: Enter the customer’s email and select the campaign.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804695/original/auA8qmeUoZATo6A_DGfna_KMVU1TMq7HvA.jpeg?1727703359)

- **Step 5**: Review and select the transaction to attribute.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804694/original/Mit0KCxykL7xKA0Y2-SXkmARg8DAHXvt0Q.jpeg?1727703358)

- **Step 6**: Confirm and submit.

### **2.** **When No Transaction Exists (Offline Sales or External Processes)**

In cases where no transaction is recorded (like a physical sale):

- **Step 1**: Open the Sub Account Affiliate Manager and go to the Affiliate Profile.
- **Step 2**: Scroll to the Commissions tab and click "Add Sales Manually."![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804700/original/1NeMJ0XWwgM5OEaEdAvE85Uk741lpene6Q.jpeg?1727703361)

- **Step 3**: If the lead or customer doesn’t exist, add them as a new lead.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804698/original/TvnpbKXzCzfzh17bVssXXjZi_x4XHpuAYQ.jpeg?1727703361)

- **Step 4**: Enter the transaction amount, commission will be calculated automatically based on the campaign’s default settings.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804697/original/Kf2PIrEIaXLQbCz78FwE9q8tOW2PntRa0Q.jpeg?1727703360)

- **Step 5**: Optionally, add the transaction date and reference number.
- **Step 6**: Submit and save.

```
Please Note:
When attributing a manual sale, you are only required to enter the revenue amount of the sale. The commission will be automatically calculated based on the default commission rate set for the selected affiliate campaign.

Example:
Let’s say you enter a manual sale with a revenue amount of $100, and the default commission rate for the affiliate’s campaign is 20%. In this case, the affiliate will automatically receive a commission of $20 (20% of $100) for that sale.

The system handles the commission calculation for you, ensuring that affiliates are paid according to the agreed-upon rate in their campaign.
```

### **3.** **Through Workflows and Automations**

For recurring or batch processes, use automations:

- **Step 1**: Add the "Add Manual Sales For An Affiliate" action in workflows.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804689/original/usiJrOiI83VpFERzhoy4xrwH4212GRXcuw.png?1727703358)
- **Step 2**: Choose whether to use first or latest attribution (automatic tracking based on affiliate interaction).![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804696/original/DOnZrvjSHUBL0jEYTeN-6138rmUkVDPrdA.jpeg?1727703359)

- **Step 3**: Select the affiliate campaign and enter the revenue details.
- **Step 4**: Save the workflow to automate manual sales attribution.

## **Benefits of Manual Sale Attribution**

- **Flexibility**: Manually attribute sales from offline sources or non-traditional platforms.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure all affiliate-driven sales are properly tracked and credited.
- **Custom Tracking**: Attribute sales to affiliates even if no standard tracking mechanisms (like links) were used.
