# **What is TechnoStack Analysis?**

**Technostack Analysis** is a detailed assessment of a prospect’s digital marketing infrastructure. It examines the integration and use of key marketing technologies on their website, such as tracking pixels and tags from platforms like Facebook, Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager.

This analysis helps you understand how well a prospect is using these tools to measure, track, and optimize their marketing efforts. By identifying missing or improperly set up technologies, you can spot areas where their digital marketing strategy can be improved, offering opportunities to recommend solutions that drive business growth.

## **What Does the Technostack Analysis Include?**

This feature allows you to see how well a prospect’s website is set up with critical marketing technologies, including:

- **Facebook Pixel**: Check if the Facebook Pixel is properly installed to track conversions, optimize ads, and build effective remarketing audiences.

- **Google Ads Pixel**: Ensure the Google Ads Pixel is in place to track user activity from ads, helping with campaign optimization and better ROI measurement.

- **Google Tag Manager**: Identify whether Google Tag Manager is installed and being used efficiently to manage tracking codes without needing to modify website code directly.

- **Google Analytics Pixel**: Confirm the integration of Google Analytics to track and analyze website traffic, user behavior, and conversion data.

- **Google Ads**: Check if the prospect is running Google Ads and leveraging this platform for paid search campaigns.

- **Maximise Business Growth**: By understanding where your prospect’s website stands out or falls short, you can advise on strategies that improve their marketing efforts. Whether it’s optimising their existing tools or recommending the addition of new ones, you can help them unlock growth potential.


## **How to Use Technostack Analysis**

- **Access the Prospect's Report**: Navigate to the prospect’s report to see their digital marketing ecosystem.

- **Review the Integrations**: Check the status of each pixel and tool listed above to assess whether it’s in place and functioning correctly.

- **Spot Gaps**: Identify any missing or misconfigured tools that could be impacting the effectiveness of the prospect's marketing efforts.
