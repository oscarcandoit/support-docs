## **What is the Footer Element in Email Builder?**

The Footer Element is a prebuilt section that sits at the bottom of your email layout. It’s designed to hold essential information such as company details, copyright text, and compliance links. You can fully customise its layout, background colour, and text style to match your email’s overall theme.

A well-designed footer not only provides recipients with key information but also reinforces credibility and trust.

> **Note:** Including an unsubscribe link and contact information in your email footer helps ensure compliance with email marketing regulations.
