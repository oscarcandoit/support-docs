# Never Miss a Lead Again — Even After Hours

Modified on: Fri, 25 Apr, 2025 at 3:11 AM

In the world of med spas, your potential clients are busy. They’re scrolling through Instagram during lunch breaks, researching Botox during late-night Netflix binges, or peeking at your reviews between errands. And when they finally muster the courage to reach out—maybe by clicking the “Contact” button on your site or DMing your spa—they’re _ready_. That’s your moment.

But what happens if no one’s there to respond?

That silence could cost you hundreds—or even thousands—of dollars in missed bookings. In an industry built on trust and aesthetic precision, speed, professionalism, and consistency in communication set the great med spas apart from the good ones. The solution? **Automated lead capture and follow-up workflows built inside GoHighLevel**.

This guide walks you through how to create a seamless, always-on system that:

- Captures every potential lead across channels (even while you sleep)

- Sends timely, warm, human-like responses

- Automatically books consults or services

- Builds relationships through nurturing messages


Let’s dive in and set your med spa up for success from that very first click.

### **Add a Lead Capture Form or Chat Widget**

Whether someone’s landing on your homepage or your Lip Filler promo page, your site should make it effortless for them to express interest.

Use a **GHL form** or **chat widget** to:

- Collect essential info: name, email, phone, service of interest

- Trigger a workflow (we’ll set this up next)

- Connect directly to your CRM so the lead never slips through


? [Chat Widget Setup Instructions](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004605)

? Pro tip: Pre-fill the form or auto-populate service dropdowns based on the page they landed on—this increases conversions.

* * *

### **Enable Missed Call Text-Back**

You know the feeling—you’re finishing a microneedling session and your phone rings. You can’t answer. Later, you check and it’s just a missed call.

With **missed call text-back**, GoHighLevel will _automatically_ reply to that number:

> “Hi! Thanks for calling \[Your Med Spa Name\]. We missed your call but would love to help. Are you looking to book a service?”

The lead stays warm. The conversation continues. You don’t lose the opportunity.

### **Build a Follow-Up Workflow (Your New Virtual Assistant)**

This is where the magic happens.

Let’s say someone fills out your form to inquire about Botox. Inside GoHighLevel, you can build a **workflow** that:

- Instantly sends a thank-you text and email

- Waits 1 hour and sends a gentle follow-up (“Still have questions about Botox?”)

- Waits 24 hours and offers a free consult or link to book

- Notifies your front desk or you via internal SMS or app alert


You’re building trust, staying top-of-mind, and guiding them toward booking—without lifting a finger.

### **Integrate Your Booking Calendar**

If your lead is ready to book, don’t make them jump through hoops.

Your follow-up messages should include direct links to:

- Book a consultation

- Schedule a specific treatment (Botox, Fillers, PRP)

- Choose from multiple team members or providers


With GoHighLevel’s calendar integration, your lead can view real-time availability, select a date, and lock it in. You get notified. They get excited. Everyone wins.

? How to Add Booking Calendars

* * *

### **Use ConversationAI or VoiceAI (Optional, But Powerful)**

For high-volume med spas or those offering 24/7 access, consider using:

- **ConversationAI**: Automates responses to common questions about pricing, downtime, and treatment benefits via chat and SMS.

- **VoiceAI**: Takes incoming calls, books consults, and qualifies leads—like a receptionist who never sleeps.

## **What This Looks Like in Action**

> "Before GHL, we were manually replying to leads the next day—if we remembered. After automating our Botox funnel, we started booking 3–5 more consults _per week_, just from faster follow-ups. It changed everything."
>
> — Mia

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Not following up** within 5–15 minutes (automation solves this!)

- Sending generic responses—always personalize with service name, name, and context

- Not connecting your calendar for instant booking

- Failing to notify your team about hot leads


* * *

## TL;DR Checklist

✅ Install a GHL chat widget or form on key pages

✅ Set up missed call text-back to capture offline leads

✅ Build a multi-step follow-up workflow with email/SMS

✅ Add calendar links to all messages

✅ Enable VoiceAI or ConversationAI if you want to automate even more
