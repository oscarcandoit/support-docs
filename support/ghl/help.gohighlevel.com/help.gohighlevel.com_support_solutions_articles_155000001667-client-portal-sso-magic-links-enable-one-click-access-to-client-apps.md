# Client Portal SSO Magic Links: Enable One-Click Access to Client Apps

Modified on: Thu, 31 Jul, 2025 at 7:20 AM

This article will guide you through how to create and use SSO (Single Sign-On) Magic Links to give clients instant, secure access to individual client portal apps—such as Courses, Communities, or Affiliates—without requiring login credentials. You’ll also learn how to embed these links as custom menu items in the client portal, control access visibility, and streamline navigation for a more professional client experience.

* * *

# **What Are SSO Magic Links?**

SSO Magic Links are unique, authenticated URLs that allow users to directly access a client portal app without entering login credentials. When a client clicks their personalized link, they’re instantly logged in and taken to the correct destination—whether it’s a course dashboard, community area, or affiliate portal.

These links are app-specific and contact-specific, meaning each user receives secure access to the exact portal experience they’ve been granted.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of SSO Magic Links**

SSO Magic Links are designed to reduce friction, save time, and increase client satisfaction. Key advantages include:

- **One-Click Login:** Instant access without entering a username or password.

- **Faster Onboarding:** Clients can get started with their app experience right away.

- **Fewer Support Tickets:** Eliminates login-related issues such as forgotten passwords.

- **Improved Navigation:** Offers a smoother, more direct login experience.

- **Multi-App Convenience:** Ideal for setups that include multiple apps like Courses + Communities + Affiliates.

- **Higher Engagement:** Easier access encourages repeat visits and ongoing interaction.

* * *

## **How to Generate and Use Magic Links**

Magic Links can be created from the Client Portal Dashboard and shared with contacts to provide direct access to specific apps.

### **Access the Sites Dashboard**

Navigate to the **Sites** tab from the left-hand menu to access your Client Portal Dashboard. This area allows you to manage your client-facing apps and create secure login experiences.

### **Open the Client Portal Section**

Within the Sites menu, click the **Client Portal** dropdown at the top and select **Dashboard**. This gives you access to client portal management tools like Magic Link generation and app settings.

### **Select the App**

To add a Magic Link as a menu item:

### **Switch to Agency View**
