- [How to Use It:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004180-improved-email-campaign-flow-and-campaign-summary-page#How-to-Use-It%3A)
- [Note:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004180-improved-email-campaign-flow-and-campaign-summary-page#Note%3A)

## **What's New?**

- Start Campaigns Directly from the Template Library

- Checklist for missing or incorrect fields, so you can quickly resolve any issues before sending.

- Improved UI of send or schedule screen: See your email design while composing the subject line and preview text for a smoother workflow.


## **How to Use It:**

- Go to Email Marketing -> Campaigns.

- Click New -> Email Marketing Templates.

- Choose a template and click Continue.

- Design your email, then click Send or Schedule.

- Enter key details like subject line, sender info, etc.

- Preview your email on the right, hover to edit if needed.

- Check for warnings in Required Fields, then click Confirm & Send.


## **Note:**

As of now the checklist only provides information on the mandatory fields and errors in custom fields. We will expand this to provide email limit warnings, content issues etc.
