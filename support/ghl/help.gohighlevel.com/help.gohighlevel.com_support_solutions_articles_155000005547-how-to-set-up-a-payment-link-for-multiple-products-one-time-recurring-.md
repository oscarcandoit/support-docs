# **What Are Payment Links for Multiple Products?**

Payment Links in HighLevel allow you to combine several products—both one-time and recurring—into a single checkout experience. This is especially useful for businesses offering bundled packages, digital goods, and subscription services. Instead of creating separate links for each item, everything can be managed under one unified payment flow, improving the customer journey and backend tracking.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using Multiple Products in a Payment Link**

- **Unified Checkout**: Customers can view all one-time and recurring product options in a single, organized interface.

- **Improved Sales Strategy**: Present upsell and cross-sell options together to boost total order value.

- **Clean Customer Experience**: Recurring items are selectable one at a time, while one-time items allow multiple selections.

- **Fewer Links to Manage**: All product offerings are bundled into one shareable, trackable link.

- **Custom Branding & Behavior**: You can control the page design, URL, and post-purchase behavior to fit your brand.

## **How to Set Up a Payment Link for Multiple Products**

### **Access the Payment Links Section**

Start by navigating to the Payments tab in your left-hand menu. From there, click on Payment Links at the top of the screen. This is where you can create, manage, and monitor all your existing and new payment links.

### **Create a New Payment Link**

Click the + Create New Payment Link button in the top-right corner of the Payment Links dashboard. This begins the setup process where you can choose products, customize checkout, and configure additional options.

### **Select a Product**

Begin by selecting the first product to include in your payment link. You can choose from both one-time and recurring products from your product library. This initial selection is required before you can add additional products or configure further checkout settings.

### **Add Another Product**

Click the + Add Another Product button to include multiple offerings within the same payment link. You can combine several one-time products and one recurring product, allowing customers to make multiple selections in a single checkout session. Recurring products will be grouped separately on the checkout page.

### **Enable Quantity Selection for Products**

Use the **Let customers adjust quantities** checkbox to allow buyers to choose how many units of a one-time product they want to purchase. You can set minimum and maximum limits to control bulk orders. This flexibility improves the checkout experience for customers who need multiple items.

### **Collect Customer Phone Numbers**

Enable the Require customers to add a phone number option to make phone number collection mandatory during checkout. This is helpful for follow-ups, service coordination, or verification purposes. The phone field will appear alongside other contact details in the form.

### **Collect Customer Addresses**

Enable the Collect customer addresses option if you need detailed shipping or billing information. Once selected, address fields such as street, city, state, country, and postal code will be shown on the checkout page—ideal for physical product delivery or compliance requirements.

### **Enable Coupon Codes at Checkout**

Select the Allow coupon codes option to display a coupon code field on the checkout page. This allows customers to apply discount codes to their purchases, helping drive promotional campaigns and incentivize higher conversions.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048600962/original/xyC73GpDSPrUvi4LbXP_qSKfZNHNjuwLHw.png?1750410324)

### **Add Post-Purchase Redirect URL**

Activate the Enable redirection to custom URL option to automatically guide customers to a specific page after completing their payment. You can define the redirect destination and choose whether it opens in a new tab or within the current one—ideal for thank-you pages or next-step instructions.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048600983/original/v2m03c5md8G2K14FeQZNzCDVlvis1X2Gzw.png?1750410364)

### **Customize the Call-to-Action Button Text**

Use the dropdown under Call to action for payment link button to personalize the button label based on your offering. You can select from options like “Pay,” “Book,” or “Donate” to align the CTA with your product type or user journey. This helps set the right expectations and improve conversion clarity.

### **Add a Branding Message**

Enable the Branding option to include a custom “Powered by” label on the checkout page. You can edit the text to display your agency or business name, reinforcing brand visibility and trust during the checkout experience.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048601034/original/eJWkFLuqr5KLotXLkAIVcIIdlk2mKxh-VA.png?1750410427)

### **Add Terms and Conditions**

Use the Add Terms and Conditions option to include important legal or policy-related information for your transaction. The message appears just below the Pay button on the checkout page, ensuring customers review key terms before completing the purchase. You can format the text for clarity and emphasis.

### **Set Automatic Deactivation Date**

Use the Automatic Deactivation setting to specify a date when the payment link should expire. This is helpful for time-bound offers, limited campaigns, or subscription windows. Once the selected date is reached, the link will no longer be accessible to customers.

### **Choose Between Test and Live Payment Modes**

Use the Payment Mode toggle to switch between **Test** and **Live** environments. In Test mode, you can simulate payments using test card numbers without processing actual transactions. Switch to Live mode when you’re ready to accept real payments from customers.

### **Name Your Payment Link**

Use the field at the top of the screen to enter a custom name for your payment link. This internal name helps you organize and identify links in your dashboard. It does not affect the customer-facing checkout page.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048601199/original/E1evz36kl3gPxes3NuHXlfUs4Yp_HP2VkA.png?1750410561)

### **Share the Payment Link**

Click the **Copy / Send** button to access options for distributing your payment link. You can copy a generic link to share with any customer or send a personalized version directly via email or SMS from within HighLevel.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048601261/original/Yt1Vv9QawWQkYRxAo_fuql2M_V0q4EpAHA.png?1750410598)

### **Copy or Personalize the Payment Link**

Choose to copy a standard link for general use or generate a personalized payment link with prefilled customer data. Use the dropdown menu to select a contact and get the customized payment link for the selected contact.

Use the Send to Contacts option to deliver payment links via email, SMS, or both. Select the contact, choose your communication method, and customize the subject line and templates to match your campaign or offer.

### **Preview the Payment Link Checkout Page**

Click the Preview button to see how your payment link will appear to customers. This allows you to verify product grouping, branding elements, form fields, and overall layout before sharing the link publicly.
