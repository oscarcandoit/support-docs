* * *

## **Key Benefits of Send Documents via SMS**

Delivering documents through SMS provides a faster and more reliable way to connect with your clients. With configurable defaults and flexible sending options, this feature improves efficiency and communication.

- **Higher Visibility**: SMS messages are more likely to be seen immediately compared to emails.

- **Flexible Delivery**: Choose SMS only, Email only, or Email + SMS for maximum visibility.

- **Custom Messaging**: Use Snippets to create personalized SMS templates for document delivery.

- **Workflow Integration**: Automate document sends via workflows with SMS as a delivery option.

- **Time-Saving Defaults**: Configure global defaults for document sent and signed notifications.

- **Improved Recipient Management**: View contact information while adding recipients to documents.

## **Global Defaults for Document Notifications**

Setting global defaults ensures that your document delivery method is consistent and time-efficient. These defaults apply across all documents unless manually overridden.

### **Step 1: Navigate to Documents & Contracts**

1. From the left-hand menu, click on **Payments**.
