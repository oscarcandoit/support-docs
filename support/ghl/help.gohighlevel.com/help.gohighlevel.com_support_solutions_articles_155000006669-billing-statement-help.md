# Billing Statement Help

Modified on: Thu, 13 Nov, 2025 at 12:59 AM

### **Overview**

This article explains the **billing statement requirements** for the upcoming **number porting feature** in HighLevel.

When you port your existing phone number(s) into HighLevel, carriers require proof that you own those numbers. This proof comes in the form of a **billing statement or account record** from your current service provider.

Providing the correct documentation ensures that your port request is processed quickly and successfully. Missing, incomplete, or outdated documents may result in **rejection or delay** of your porting request.

* * *

### **If You Are Porting a Google Voice Number**

If your number is registered with **Google Voice**, please take a **screenshot** of your Google Voice settings page.

Make sure the screenshot includes:

- Your **phone number**, and

- Your **email address**


This screenshot will serve as your proof of ownership for the Google Voice number you’re porting.

* * *

### **If You Are Porting a Landline or VoIP Number**

If you’re porting a **Landline or VoIP number**, please provide your **latest monthly billing statement** from your current provider.

Your document must include:

- The **phone number(s)** you’re attempting to port

- The **account owner’s name**


#### **Additional Requirements**

- The billing statement **must not be older than 90 days**.

- The **latest billing statement** is preferred for faster processing.

- If your provider doesn’t issue a bill, you may submit:

  - A **receipt of your phone number purchase**, or

  - A **screenshot from your account portal** showing the phone number(s) and owner’s name.
- If you’re porting multiple numbers, **a separate billing statement for each number** is preferred.


* * *

### **Why This Is Important**

Carriers use billing statements to verify **ownership of phone numbers** and to prevent unauthorized transfers.

Submitting accurate and up-to-date documentation helps ensure your number porting process completes efficiently and without issues.
