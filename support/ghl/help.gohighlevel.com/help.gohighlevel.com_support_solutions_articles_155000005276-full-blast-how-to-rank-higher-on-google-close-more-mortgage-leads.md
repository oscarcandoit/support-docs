**Are Borrowers Finding Your Competitors First?**

You’re great at guiding clients through financing—home loans, pre-approvals, refinancing, or first-time buyers. But are you consistently getting inbound leads _without_ chasing agents or burning money on ads?

Many mortgage professionals struggle with:

- Inconsistent deal flow and referral droughts

- Complicated lead follow-ups that fall through the cracks

- Losing top search spots to big-name lenders

- Wasting ad spend without knowing what’s working


**Stat Check**: 72% of borrowers only apply with one lender—typically the _first one_ they find online.

If you’re not ranking high on Google and automating follow-ups, you’re leaving deals on the table.

## **What If You Had a System That Worked While You Slept?**

Picture this:

- Your mortgage business ranks at the top of Google for “mortgage broker near me”

- Borrowers book consults 24/7—no cold calls or chasing

- Automated systems follow up instantly so no deal slips away

- You track every click, call, and loan app to know exactly what converts


This playbook shows you exactly how to:

✅ Rank higher on Google

✅ Capture more borrower leads

✅ Automate follow-ups

✅ Track everything

✅ Convert more consultations into funded deals

* * *

## **Step 1: Optimize Your Google Business Profile for Local Borrowers**

### Why It Matters?

97% of home loan borrowers search online before choosing a mortgage provider.

And 68% of mobile searches for “mortgage broker near me” result in a call within 24 hours.

### 1.1 Set Up & Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GMB)

- Make sure your **business name, phone, and address** are identical across your website, listings, and social pages.

- Add keywords like:

→ “First-time homebuyer loans”

→ “Refinance in \[City\]”

→ “FHA loan help”

- Upload headshots, closings, and photos from client success stories


**Pro Tip**: Add FAQ content to GMB like “What documents do I need for a pre-approval?”

### 1.2 Enable Google Messaging & Call Tracking

- Let prospects text you directly from search

- Use **HighLevel’s call tracking numbers** so you know which campaigns and locations generate the most calls


Example: “5 buyers booked a call last week through your ‘Pre-Approval in 24 Hours’ GMB post.”

### 1.3 Automate Google Reviews After Each Closing

- 50+ 5-star reviews = major SEO boost

- Use **HighLevel's Review Request Automation** (SMS & email)

- Send a review link automatically once the loan closes

## **Step 2: Convert More Website Visitors Into Leads**

### Why It Matters

Most mortgage websites leak leads—slow load times, poor CTAs, and no follow-up.

[Sites Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001633)

### 2.1 Use Mortgage-Specific SEO

Embed local mortgage search terms in:

- Homepage title: “Top Mortgage Broker in \[City\] \| Pre-Approvals in 24 Hours”

- Service pages: “VA Loan Specialist in \[City\]” / “FHA Mortgage Help”

- Blogs: “Should I Buy or Wait in 2025?” or “How to Get Pre-Approved Fast”


**Example**: Rank blog posts answering common questions like “Is now a good time to refinance?”

#### [How to Optimize for SEO Meta Data](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000980312)

### 2.2 Capture Borrowers with Conversion-Driven CTAs

Use **HighLevel’s funnel builder** or embed forms on your website with:

- “Book a Free Consultation”

- “Check My Rates”

- “Get Pre-Approved Now”


Tools to Add:

- Lead form pop-ups

- Chat widget (HighLevel’s AI bot answers instantly)

- Exit intent forms: “Leaving? Grab our home loan checklist before you go!”

* * *

## **Step 3: Speed, Mobile, & Trust = Better SEO Rankings**

### 3.1 Speed Up Your Site

- Google drops slow mortgage sites down the rankings

- Compress images, remove bloated plugins, and use **HighLevel’s fast funnel/website builder**


### 3.2 Add Mortgage Schema Markup (Structured Data)

- Schema tells Google what your site is about

- Add “Mortgage Broker” or “Loan Officer” schema to show up in rich search results


Example: Show up as a “Top Mortgage Expert in \[City\]” with review stars and business hours in the search result snippet

## **Step 4: Build Local Trust with High-Quality Backlinks**

### Why It Matters

The more other trustworthy sites link to you, the more Google trusts you.

### 4.1 Get Local Listings

- Add your business to: Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Yelp, LendingTree, and local chamber directories


### 4.2 Guest Post or Collaborate with Real Estate Blogs

- Write about “3 Pre-Approval Mistakes Buyers Make”

- Get real estate agents to link back to you as a trusted lender


**Bonus**: Share these guest posts on your social media and boost them with ads

* * *

## **Step 5: Track, Automate, and Convert More Borrowers**

### Why It Matters

If you’re not tracking it, you’re guessing. HighLevel gives you visibility across every lead, click, and call.

### 5.1 Track Everything in HighLevel’s Dashboard

- See where your best mortgage leads come from

- Measure form completions, booked calls, and GMB engagement
