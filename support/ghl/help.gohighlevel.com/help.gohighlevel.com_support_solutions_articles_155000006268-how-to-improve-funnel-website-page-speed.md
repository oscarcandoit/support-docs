# How to Improve Funnel & Website Page Speed

Modified on: Fri, 12 Sep, 2025 at 12:40 AM

A fast-loading page is critical for conversions, user experience, and SEO. If your funnel or website feels slow, here are steps you can take to improve page speed.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

- [1\. Optimize Images](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006268-how-to-improve-funnel-website-page-speed#1.-Optimize-Images)
- [2\. Limit Heavy Elements](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006268-how-to-improve-funnel-website-page-speed#2.-Limit-Heavy-Elements)
- [3\. Clean Up Your Pages](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006268-how-to-improve-funnel-website-page-speed#3.-Clean-Up-Your-Pages)
- [4\. Use System Features Wisely](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006268-how-to-improve-funnel-website-page-speed#4.-Use-System-Features-Wisely)
- [5\. Leverage Browser & Hosting Optimizations](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006268-how-to-improve-funnel-website-page-speed#5.-Leverage-Browser-&-Hosting-Optimizations)
- [6\. Test and Monitor Performance](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006268-how-to-improve-funnel-website-page-speed#6.-Test-and-Monitor-Performance)

* * *

## **1\. Optimize Images**

- **Resize before upload**: Don’t upload giant images and expect the system to resize them. Keep them close to the display size.

- **Use compressed formats**: Save images as JPG or WebP for photos and PNG for graphics with transparency.

- **Limit the number of images**: Fewer images = fewer requests = faster load time. Use images only where they add real value (e.g., one strong hero image instead of several).


* * *

## **2\. Limit Heavy Elements**

- **Reduce video backgrounds**: Use short loops, smaller files for video backgrounds.

- **Limit animations and widgets**: Too many moving parts slow down rendering.

- **Keep scripts minimal**: Avoid stacking third-party tracking scripts unless absolutely needed.

- **Avoid heavy elements above the fold**: Ensure the first screen loads quickly by keeping it simple and lightweight.


* * *

## **3\. Clean Up Your Pages**

- **Remove unused sections**: Don’t leave hidden or duplicate blocks you aren’t using.

- **Simplify layouts**: Fewer rows, columns, and elements = faster rendering.

- **Check for oversized files**: Upload optimized PDFs or downloadable content.


* * *

## **4\. Use System Features Wisely**

- **Global Sections**: Reuse blocks for efficiency instead of duplicating large layouts.

- **Forms & Surveys**: Embed HighLevel-native ones instead of third-party versions (they load faster).

- **Custom Code**: Keep injected CSS lightweight.

- **Check system settings**:

  - Ensure **“Optimise Javascript”** is enabled in funnel settings.

  - Ensure **“Image optimisation”** is enabled in funnel settings.
- **Inspect network requests**: Use the browser’s developer tools to check the **Network tab** and spot any **large images** slowing down page load.


* * *

## **5\. Leverage Browser & Hosting Optimizations**

- **Enable caching**: Returning visitors load faster with cached assets.

- **Use a custom domain with SSL**: Speeds up delivery and improves trust.

- **Check hosting location**: HighLevel uses global CDN, but a clean custom domain setup avoids extra redirects.


* * *

## **6\. Test and Monitor Performance**

- Use free tools like:

  - [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

  - [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
- Run tests on desktop _and_ mobile (mobile is usually slower).

- Apply suggested fixes from the tools for best results.
