Modified on: Wed, 22 Jan, 2025 at 7:00 PM

Activate Email Verification to have MailGun verify your new emails automatically inside the CRM.

**Please note:**

```
Activating email verification in the CRM will incur costs from MailGun in your MailGun account. Email verification is a paid service and is charged at $0.012 / email - Check MailGun for pricing.
```

# **FAQ**

### **How does email verification work?**

Email verification checks emails against Mailgun's records when entering the system for the first time (form, survey, calendars, chat widget) or when sending a new email **after** enabling email verification **.** And every 90 days if enabled.

Head into the contact record >scroll down the right side > click the envelope icon.

- Green = Valid
- Red = Invalid, too old, previously bounced, unsubscribed, etc. The error would specify why the Email is invalid.
