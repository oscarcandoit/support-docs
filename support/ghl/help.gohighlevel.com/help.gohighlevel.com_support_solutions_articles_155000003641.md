## **Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an Affiliate Campaign**

### **Step 1: Start by Clicking the "Add" Button**

Navigate to the **Campaign** page and click the "+ Add" button to initiate the creation of your campaign.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781718/original/x2R2sEUsJiAMxg9fj0xY3Y577S-Fu3DumA.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 2: Choose Your Campaign Source**

Select the source for your campaign, such as a funnel, website, or store where your products are listed.

### **Step 3: Configure Source Details**

You can also choose the landing page where potential customers will land. Once set, the system will generate a default campaign URL. This URL includes a unique affiliate link, where the placeholder `<<affiliate_id>>` is automatically replaced with each affiliate's unique ID.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781724/original/ZBtujVrvdHxcz9ToqznlorQhRDZ-crR4cQ.jpeg?1727691000)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781716/original/RaKWk2FxX9qCPb7sXXYyiKqZPNXBhUwk5w.jpeg?1727691000)

```
Please Note:
Currently, only funnels, websites, and stores support product sales via affiliate campaigns. However, you can also track leads and pay affiliates for generating leads through forms, surveys, and calendars. Learn more here.

Landing page selection is just used to set where the potentials customers will land. Please note that tracking will be done source wide not just on the landing page
```

### **Step 4: Review Your Product List**

Review the products associated with your selected source. Add or remove products to ensure that only commission-eligible items are listed.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781717/original/z6mS3KYOu-HsFjnHgpwVjYFBM-tmHmQ2hg.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 5: Set Default Commission**

Establish a default commission for your campaign, choosing either a flat fee or a percentage of the product price.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781714/original/iaAewggi3qR-EpTaHYAeRoOgQ4sSrQF1jA.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 6: Customize Product-Level Commissions (Optional)**

Optionally, set specific commissions at the product level to tailor payouts based on individual product prices.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781723/original/ti7BKz8eGAdARlnMfV4lALQmDmfuf40o4g.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 7: Enable Multi-Tier Commissions**

Access the **Advanced Commissions** settings to enable multi-tier commissions. You can support up to 7 tiers for more intricate commission structures. [Learn more here.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003642)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781720/original/ksW7cgUS_iICkEz_CpNOnvZbnmMEGSEbCw.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 8: Configure Tier-Specific Commissions**

Assign commissions to each tier by either applying the default rate or customizing them for each level based on performance.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781713/original/LrUv3uJsLCNoPLCsgnevcXOA9UzwI8jr1g.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 9: Add a Campaign Description (Optional)**

Add a campaign description that outlines its purpose to make it more attractive to potential affiliates.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781715/original/J0TTyCwIlA-LG3RseQd5HHQKtCEFv1fOiw.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 10: Assign Affiliates Directly**

Review affiliate details, such as their join date and total affiliate count, before directly assigning them to your campaign.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781722/original/GaGiOLmMrLJfqPJp7oTdtCj7uFCnC_0-zA.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 11: Adjust Additional Settings**

Tailor your campaign further with options such as:

- Email templates for affiliate onboarding
- Cookie duration for tracking affiliate activity
- Payout terms
- Including setup fees in commission calculations
- Enabling sub-affiliate signups
- Auto-enrolling new customers as sub-affiliates

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781721/original/dCpccd0oPMEupNfRZrVinHbinh9DGmH0Ew.jpeg?1727691000)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033781719/original/c3uDUHW_bHs03toyL6-XULcgZcdDAZoe4w.jpeg?1727691000)

### **Step 12: Publish or Save as Draft**

Once satisfied with your campaign setup, you can choose to **Publish** it immediately or **Save as Draft** for further editing.

* * *

**Congratulations!** Your affiliate campaign is now live and ready to drive results. With these intuitive tools, you’re equipped to grow your business and reward your affiliates for their contributions.

* * *

## **⚠️ Changing the Source in an Existing Campaign**

You can now **edit the source** of an affiliate campaign even after it’s published — for example, if the funnel, course, or website it was linked to has been deleted or changed.

```
Important: When you change the source, the affiliate referral URL will also change.
The old URL will stop tracking, and only the new one will work going forward.
```

**What You Should Do:**

- After changing the source, **inform your affiliates** that their referral links have changed

- Encourage them to **update any shared links** immediately to avoid missing out on commissions

- Note: All other campaign settings and past performance data will remain unaffected


By making sure your affiliates are aware of this change, you can avoid confusion and unnecessary support tickets about links not working.
