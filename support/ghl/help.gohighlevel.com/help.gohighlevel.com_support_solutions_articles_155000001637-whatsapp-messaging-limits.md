# Understanding WhatsApp Messaging Limits

WhatsApp messaging limits refer to the maximum number of business-initiated conversations that a business phone number can open within a 24-hour period. These conversations typically arise from sending marketing, utility, or authentication templates to WhatsApp users. Here, Meta delve into how these limits function and how you can navigate them effectively.

* * *

# Initial WhatsApp Messaging Limits

Initially, business phone numbers are capped at 250 business-initiated conversations within a 24-hour period. However, this limit is adjustable and can be increased to accommodate higher volumes. The increments include:

- 1K business-initiated conversations
- 10K business-initiated conversations
- 100K business-initiated conversations
- An unlimited number of business-initiated conversations

* * *

# Increasing WhatsApp Messaging Limit

```
Note that in order for your business phone number to be eligible for an increase, it must have a connected status, and if your business phone number has a low quality rating, it may continue to be limited to 250 business-initiated conversations until its quality rating improves.
```

## **Business Verification**

Submit your business for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817). If your business is approved, Meta will analyze your [messaging quality](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#messaging-quality) to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, Meta will then either [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) or [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) a messaging limit increase.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155024898924/original/flaijVvBm7jbgNfIieDYCcLSGZrnFIccXQ.png?1713857256)

## **Identity Verification**

If you submit your business for verification and are approved, you may be asked to [verify your identity](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/587323819101032).

If you are asked to verify your identity, the [**WhatsApp Manager**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/) \> **Overview** \> **Limits** panel will display the following notification:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155024896857/original/Wx2M0OQXVaph-NQfMHg-_8C_KrDjEvQAUA.png?1713854985)

If you complete identity verification and your identity is confirmed, Meta will [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) a messaging limit increase. If your identity is not confirmed, Meta will [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) a messaging limit increase, and

```
WhatsApp Manager > Overview > Limits panel
```

will display one the following notifications:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155024896906/original/gcYX6j1iQK0I1RQG4dRaD6H_F3uGtFRqLQ.png?1713855043)

## ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155024896918/original/cAbM9SCQmwMZvkEJI2O2ZhC9mHHein4dFA.png?1713855050)

## **Open 1K Conversations in 30 Days**

Open 1,000 or more business-initiated conversations in a 30-day moving period using templates with a [high quality rating](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/896873687365001). Once you reach this threshold, Meta will analyze your [messaging quality](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#messaging-quality) to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, Meta will then either [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) or [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) an increase.

## **Send High-Quality Messages**

If you are rejected for business or identity verification, ensure that you are sending high-quality messages. Meta will periodically reevaluate your messaging activity and quality and based on this analysis, may [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) an increase.

Here are some guidelines for sending high-quality messages:

- Make sure messages follow the [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR32s0sx7BV-s-H2qLRdlqPXowSfdAkcyu451sDhd3zojoWkvitoHdYC2TE_aem_AfXsqBIoXPdFha8AAq55fELrm7Un-QpMMQ17WTmh0CwRmBaXtDvBlWzZawuXFlsEjajqzvRZCFVKtKSCpHIdgdkX).
- Only send messages to users who have opted into receiving messages from your business.
- Make the messages highly personalized and useful to users. Avoid sending open-ended welcome or introductory messages.
- Be mindful of messaging frequency; avoid sending customers too many messages a day. Be thoughtful of informational messages, optimizing for content and length.

## **Request an Increase**

If you completed business verification or identity verification, or have met the 1K conversations in 30 days threshold, but are still limited to 250 business-initiated conversations, you can open a direct support ticket and request a messaging tier upgrade

```
Ask a Question > WABiz: Phone Number & Registration > Request type > Request a Messaging Tier Upgrade
```

Based on your support submission and [messaging quality](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#messaging-quality), Meta will either [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) or [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) an increase.

# Best Practices

**Opt-In Consent:** Always ensure that customers have explicitly opted in to receive messages from your business on WhatsApp. Respect their privacy and preferences.

**Timely Responses:** Aim to respond to customer inquiries promptly. Quick responses enhance customer satisfaction and improve the overall customer experience.

**Personalization:** Tailor your messages to each customer whenever possible. Personalized messages tend to be more engaging and can foster stronger customer relationships.

**Value-Added Content:** Provide valuable content to your customers through WhatsApp, such as product updates, exclusive offers, and helpful tips related to your industry.

**Clear Communication:** Ensure your messages are concise, clear, and relevant. Avoid spammy or irrelevant content that could annoy customers.

**Example**

```
Send: "Hi Sarah! We're excited to share that our Spring Collection has arrived! ? Check out the latest styles and enjoy 20% off your first purchase with code SPRING20. Shop now: [Link]"
```

```
Avoid: "Hey Sarah! Did you know we sell shoes too ? Come visit our store for amazing deals on footwear!!!! #ShoeLove
```

**Security Measures:** Implement security measures to protect customer data and ensure the confidentiality of conversations. Avoid sharing sensitive information over WhatsApp.

**Feedback Loop:** Encourage customers to provide feedback on their experience with your business on WhatsApp. Use this feedback to improve your services and offerings.

## **Q: How can I increase my conversation limit?**
