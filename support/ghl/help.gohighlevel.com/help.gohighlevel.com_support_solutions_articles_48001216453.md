This Article is a complete guide for all cancellation processes for SaaS-enabled sub-accounts. It contains instructions on how to cancel a SAAS sub-account for your client and how to allow them to cancel their SAAS subscription with your Agency.

```
IMPORTANT: Key points to remember when Cancelling Saas for a Sub-account.

1. You must be logged in with an Agency-level (admin) user – sub-accounts can only be canceled by Agency admins.

2. If you don’t see “Cancel SaaS” under Settings → SaaS, go to Agency Dashboard → Sub-accounts, click the three-dot menu on the client’s tile, and select “Cancel Subscription.”

3. If the button is still missing, ensure the sub-account has an active SaaS plan. Inactive or trial accounts won’t show a cancel option.

If you’ve verified the above and still can’t cancel, please reach out to HighLevel Support
```

If the client has any non-complimentary credits in their wallet, you must refund those in Stripe.

You can check if the wallet credits are complimentary or non-complimentary by going to sub-account settings > Company Billing > See Details (Transaction History)

```
For more details, please review this article: SaaS Wallet Credit Management

### **Step 3: Close Twilio / Mailgun Sub-Accounts - For Clients who're leaving your Agency**

If the sub-account has Twilio or Email (Mailgun), Rebilling is turned on after disabling SaaS; their Twilio / Mailgun sub-account will still be connected in Agency Settings > Twilio / Mailgun. Make sure you've deleted those connections and closed these sub-accounts.

* * *

### **Step 4: Remove User from Team Management / Delete the Sub-Account - For Clients who're leaving your Agency**

This step depends on your choice.

1. If you want to keep the client's data even after removing them, go to Agency Settings > Team and remove the client's user.
2. If you don't want to keep their data, go to Accounts > View Details, and delete the sub-account

## **Instructions to allow the client to cancel their subscription**

SaaS agencies can now allow their SaaS clients to cancel their subscriptions. **This feature is turned off by default because we believe taking cancellation requests and getting an opportunity to save the SaaS client is essential in churn-aversion.** But regardless, the decision rests with the agencies now! Agencies can enable this feature by going to their SaaS configurator.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48283853058/original/EXydpUSYh0jRtPZZbCAuKJDLeV7gfPi9XQ.png?1677443608)

Mark the checkbox to **Allow clients(sub-accounts) to cancel their subscriptions** and then hit the **Save Changes** button.

**Please Note:**

```
This will apply this setting to all SAAS accounts that will be created using your SAAS configurator moving forward.
```

This feature can also be controlled at a per-client level by Going to the **Agency Sidebar> Sub-Accounts> Scroll to the specific client> Click on their name or on Manage Client:**
