# **Custom Fields Questions**

### **Q: How can I see my custom fields in an Opportunity?**

When you go to 'Opportunities' and select or create an opportunity, you'll see your custom fields listed. When you edit an opportunity, these fields are available for input. If you've organized your fields into folders, these will appear one after the other.

### **Q: What does the 'hide empty fields' feature do?**

When enabled, the 'hide empty fields' feature hides all fields with no value. This allows you to focus only on fields that are relevant or required for you, providing a cleaner, more streamlined view of your opportunity data.

### **Q: How can I edit the values in "lost reason" field under Opportunities**

Step 1: Go to Settings > Custom Fields

Step 2: Select Lost Reason and click on Bulk Actions > Edit

Step 3: Make changes to your lost reason values in the modal and save for them to reflect.

```
If the name of the lost reason is changed for any of these instances, all the places where the lost reason was being invoked will start showing the new name for the same.
