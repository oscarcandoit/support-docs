# Set frequency for certificate expiry reminders (emails)

Modified on: Fri, 10 Jan, 2025 at 6:42 AM

**Overview:** With the latest update, you can now customize the number of days before an expiry date to receive reminder emails. This feature replaces the default intervals of 2 and 7 days before expiry, giving you greater control over when you receive important notifications.

**Key Benefits:**

- Customize reminder intervals based on your preferences.

- Ensure timely notifications that align with your schedule.

- Stay in control of expiry reminders for a better user experience.


**How to Set Custom Expiry Reminder Intervals:**

1. **Access Your Account Settings:**

   - Log in to your account.

   - Navigate to the **Certificates section under membership**
2. **Edit Reminder Preferences for Certificate Templates-**

   - **Adding an expiry date to a template would mean that everyone who receives the certificate, it will expire on the same date.**

   - Locate the certificate template wherein you want to add expiry option.

   - Click **3 dots > Set Expiry and choose a relevant date** to modify your preferences.

   - For a selected date, you can choose whether you want 2 reminder emails to go out or 1 and toggle them on/off.

   - **Add all relevant days for each reminder email. All emails will be sent out after the number of days that are added.**

   - **The same can be done for all certificates under Issued certificate tab for individual level customisation.**



     **Note: Only certificate expired email will go out on the day of expiry when Immediately is selected**

**Important Note:**

- All previously scheduled reminder emails will continue to follow the default intervals of 2 and 7 days unless manually adjusted by the user.
