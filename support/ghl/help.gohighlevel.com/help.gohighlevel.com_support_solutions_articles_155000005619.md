## How will these channels be displayed?

At a time only one of the messaging channel will be displayed on GBP results though both can be connected. All the social channels will be displayed on GBP page result under about section.

    ✅ **Important:** If both whatsapp and text messages is added, Text message will be displayed on GBP result.

## Text/Whatsapp message option is not visible on GBP results:

I have added text & whatsapp channel but these are not visible in GBP results. This may primarily be due to Google's validation for each number being added. Please follow below steps:

1\. Go to GBP page setup by either clicking on Update GBP over page selection module in CRM or by going to edit page on google console.

2\. Check if edit was approved. Approval is handled by Google team with no influence from our side. In case edit is not approved you can raise a ticket to google directly.
