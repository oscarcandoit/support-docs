# **What is Bulk QR Code Generation?**

Bulk QR Code Creation is a built‑in feature within HighLevel’s QR Code Generator that allows you to turn a list of names and URLs into fully generated, ready‑to‑download QR codes within seconds. It eliminates repetitive manual work of creating each code individually, delivering a complete set of static QR codes that can be exported, printed, or embedded across your marketing channels.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Bulk QR Code Creation**

Bulk QR Code Creation removes friction for teams on high‑volume QR code projects.

- **Time Savings**: Generate 10 or 10,000 QR codes in seconds using a CSV file, no manual repetitive process

- **Organization**: Assign bulk‑created QR codes to a folder, keeping related codes grouped neatly together

- **Error Visibility**: Built‑in validation flags any bad rows so you can fix issues immediately

- **Progress Transparency**: Watch a live counter as codes are processed, so you always know when the batch is finished

- **Ready‑To‑U** **se exports**: Download print-ready PNG, SVG, or PDF versions once generation is complete

* * *

## **CSV Upload for Bulk Generation**

Uploading a properly formatted CSV is the heart of bulk QR code creation. By keeping the file lean (just two columns) you avoid mapping headaches and reduce error rates. Each row will generate one QR Code. Follow these guidelines to get started:

- Click **Download Sample CSV** in the Create Bulk QR Codespopup to use a pre-formatted template.

- **Required Columns**




  - **Name:** the display name for the QR Code

  - **URL:** the full destination URL
- Ensure there are no additional columns, blank rows or blank header cells.

* * *

## **Troubleshooting CSV Errors**

Even small typos can break a bulk upload. Here are some common errors run into while uploading the CSV file:

- **Incorrect or Missing Headers**: Ensure the top row reads exactly _url, name_. Incorrect headers will result in an error message.

- **Invalid URL**: Confirm each URL starts with http:// or https:// and contains no spaces. Invalid URLs will result in an error message pinpointing the row causing this error.

## **Assigning QR Codes to a Folder (Optional)**

Folder assignment keeps your workspace tidy and makes organization a breeze. When bulk generating QR Codes, select an existing folder from the dropdown (you must create the folder beforehand, as only pre-existing folders appear during upload). All generated QR codes in the bulk creation will inherit the selected folder. If no folder is selected, the QR Codes will be stored in the root folder.

After creation, you can move your QR Codes into, out of or between folders. To move aQR code, click the **3 dot** icon on the code and select **Move to Folder**, then choose the folder you would like to move it into.
