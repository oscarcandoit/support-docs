## **What are Nested Layouts?**

Nested Layouts allow you to place layout containers within other layout containers, giving you precise control over how elements are structured on a page. This structure enables you to easily manage multi-column designs, adaptive spacing, and responsive sections with enhanced visual control.

Whether you’re creating opt-in pages, comparison tables, or product showcases, Nested Layouts simplify the process while enhancing visual consistency and alignment.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Nested Layouts**

Nested Layouts eliminate complexity and add power to your page design toolkit:

- **Flexible Structure**: Easily place rows, columns, and other layouts within one another.

- **Real-Time Settings**: Instantly change layout direction (row, column, collage) with live previews.

- **Precise Spacing Tools**: Set margins, padding, and alignment exactly how you want—at every level.

- **No More Workarounds**: Design complex pages without custom CSS or third-party solutions.

- **Reusable Layouts**: Save time by duplicating and modifying nested containers for consistent branding.


* * *

## **How To Set Up Nested Layouts in the Builder**

Nested Layouts are easy to implement using the Funnel or Website Builder’s drag-and-drop interface. Here’s how to get started:

1. Log in to your subaccount and open your desired Funnel or Website.

2. Drag a **Layout Container** onto the canvas.

3. Drag a second Layout Container into the first to form the nested structure.

4. Open **Layout Settings** and choose **row**, **column**, or **collage** orientation.

5. Adjust **Spacing & Alignment** for margins, padding, and positioning. Repeat steps 3–5 for additional nested levels as needed.

6. Click **Save** to commit your layout or add it to **Saved Sections** for reuse.

## **Examples of What You Can Build Now**

- Two-column opt-in pages:
Put your headline and form on one side, testimonials and social proof on the other.
- Pricing comparison tables:
Create multi-column layouts with different sized sections for features, pricing, and call-to-action buttons.
- Feature showcase grids:
Build complex layouts with images, text, and buttons that align perfectly across rows and columns.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do I add a nested container?**

Drag a Layout Container into an existing Layout Container—the blue highlight shows a valid drop zone.

**Q: Can I nest Sections or Rows?**

No. Only **Layout Containers** can be nested. Sections and Rows remain single‑level for performance reasons.

**Q: Is there a depth limit?**

Practically no, but we recommend three to four levels for maintainability and load speed.

**Q: Do Nested Layouts work in Saved Sections and Funnels?**

Yes. Saved Sections keep their nested structure and sync globally when updated.
