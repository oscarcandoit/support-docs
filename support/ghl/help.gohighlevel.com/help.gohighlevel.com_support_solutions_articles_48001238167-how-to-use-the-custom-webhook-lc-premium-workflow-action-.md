# Guide to Custom Webhook Workflow Action

Modified on: Thu, 19 Dec, 2024 at 6:47 PM

The Custom Webhook Action enables real-time data exchange between your CRM and third-party services. It allows tailored requests with various HTTP methods, authorization, headers, and query parameters. This user-friendly tool ensures efficient and accurate workflows while considering API responses and server limitations.

```
Agencies on Any Plan  ($97, $970, $297, $2970, $497, $4970) can access LC Premium Triggers & Actions.

- Once Premium Actions & Triggers are enabled via the Agency settings, EXISTING and New Sub-Accounts will have 100 free executions.

- For agencies to avoid accruing execution costs for EXISTING Sub-Accounts, rebilling will need to be enabled manually for each Sub-Account within the Agency view (more info).

- If premium actions are enabled on the SaaS Configurator, new Sub-Accounts generated will automatically be enrolled in LC Premium Actions & Triggers, no further action is required by the agency.
```

### **Step 3:** Select Authorization Method

We support various types of authorization methods, allowing you to choose the one that suits your needs when accessing the webhook.

### **Step 4:** Headers & Query Parameters

In addition to sending a request body, our system allows you to include headers and query parameters when sending requests to a webhook.

Headers can be used to provide additional information about the request, such as authentication credentials, content type, and cache control.

Query parameters, conversely, can be used to pass parameters to the webhook endpoint, allowing you to filter or modify the response data you receive.

### **Step 5:** Configure the data to be sent in the Custom Webhook

The Custom Webhook premium feature allows you to map custom values in any structure that suits your requirements. Our user-friendly textbox provides autocomplete suggestions for all custom values, including inbound webhook variables.

This feature simplifies the mapping process and saves time by suggesting potential values that match your input. Additionally, it helps ensure accuracy and consistency in your data mapping.

## **Troubleshooting**

Successful execution of the Custom Webhook Action depends on the successful response of the referenced API. Therefore, if errors are sent back, those will reflect on the Contact's Workflow execution and cause the action to be Failed (and then skipped) or Retry with exponential backoffs.

Make sure that the receiving server can handle the number of Executions that you are targeting, or else you might end up with errors due to limits being reached. The Custom Webhook Action will get fired as soon as the Contact reaches the step, so make sure to add Contacts into the Workflow with the receiving server's limits in mind.
