To setup FB integration, please follow the following document: [Facebook Lead Ads integration](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000004537)

# Troubleshoot:

## Why are my Lead Ads not making it into my Sub-Account?

1. **Do you have full access control of the Facebook page -** [Add people to a business portfolio and assign a business asset](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706)
2. **Now in your Sub-Account, check in settings> integrations > Facebook form fields mapping check if the form you have selected in ads manager is enabled in status**
3. **Can you try this to confirm if Lead Connector is accessible and has access to your page? -[https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business\_tools&ref=settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools&ref=settings)**
1. **Check if lead connector is connected with FB account![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040883734/original/P0axfyxcTqGU5Hic3LDPc5lmny61Ren4Zg.png?1738570041)**
2. **Check if all the permissions are available with lead connector in terms of page access and lead access![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040884114/original/tP84DHRfB-6M45HJ7N5C9PFFxviFOteboQ.jpg?1738570108)**
4. **Once you have completed the steps above, please use the **[Facebook leads ads testing tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing)** to see if leads are now being added to your Sub-Account.**
1. **Select Page from where lead is to be fetched**
2. **Select form to be tested.**
3. **Check if App ID: 390181264778064 is present, if not then go to step 6.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040887202/original/JOUUNggg81s9fRcmAOPlcn0B0rBkNgWrpA.jpg?1738571755)**
5. If you see that LeadConnector access to your page has been revoked or the App ID is not coming up, you will manually need to assign Lead access permissions to LeadConnector on Facebook:

i. Go to Business Suite.

ii. If you don't have access to Business Suite, go to Business Settings and select your business, skip to step (v)

iii. Click the dropdown in the top-left corner and choose your business account.

iv. Click Settings in the bottom-left corner.

v. Click More Business Settings.

vi. Click Integrations in the left menu, then click Leads Access.

## A Facebook Token Has Expired In a Sub-Account; why does this happen, and How to Fix This?

**If** you received an email with a subject that says "Important: Facebook connection has expired.", this means that the Facebook integration for one of your Sub-accounts has become disconnected.

### Why Did This Connection Break?

Several reasons could cause the integration to break. The most common are:

- A user changes their password
- The Facebook token naturally expires after some time
- A user de-authorizes your app
- A user logs out of Facebook
- A user changes page permission or adds/removes a user
- A virtual assistant in another country logs in without using a VPN

### To reconnect:

1\. Select the account indicated in the email you received from the "Switch To An Account" dropdown

2\. In the left-hand sidebar, click "Settings."

3\. From the sidebar, click "Integrations."

4\. Click the "Connected" button to disconnect the broken integration under the Facebook icon. Click on Connect again to reconnect

5\. In the window that pops up, continue as yourself, select the Facebook page that you want to connect, then click the "Connect Page" button
