**Customers book the first HVAC company they see in search results.**

**More Google reviews + local SEO = More service calls.**

### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Claim & Verify Your Google Business Profile (GBP)** – If your HVAC business isn’t listed, you’re **invisible** to customers.  ✅ **Set Up Service Areas** – List **all the cities & neighborhoods you serve** so Google shows your business in **local searches.**  [How to Set Up Google Business Profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177?hl=en)

## **Step 2: Automate Follow-Ups & Stop Losing HVAC Leads**

### **Why This Matters?**

#### **Leads go cold in 5 minutes—if you don’t follow up, they’ll book with someone else.**  **75% of HVAC jobs go to the first company that responds.**  **Automating follow-ups can increase bookings by 40%.**

### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Set Up a Chat Widget on Your Website** – So customers can **text you directly** instead of waiting for a callback.  [How to Set Up Chat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)

## **Step 3: Automate Reviews & Build a Reputation That Sells For You**

### **Why This Matters?**

#### **Businesses with 50+ Google reviews rank higher and get 270% more leads.**  **90% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal referrals.**  **A single 5-star review could book your next 10 HVAC jobs.**

### **What To Do First:**

#### ✅ **Enable Review Requests in HighLevel** – Every **completed job** should trigger an **automatic SMS & email** asking for a review.

**Even a $10/day ad budget can bring a steady stream of leads.**

**If you’re not running ads, your competitors are.**

### **What To Do First:**
