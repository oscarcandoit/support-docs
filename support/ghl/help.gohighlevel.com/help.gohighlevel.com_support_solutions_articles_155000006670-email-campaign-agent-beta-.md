# **What is Email Campaign Agent?**

Email Campaign Agent is an **Ask AI–powered flow** you access by **prompting Ask AI** with phrases like “Create an email campaign” or “Email to promote my product.” Ask AI then launches a guided, step‑by‑step builder that assembles your campaign—on‑brand copy, subject‑line tests, audience selection, and sending‑domain checks—directly inside the Campaign Builder.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Email Campaign Agent**

A focused overview of why teams use this tool and how it accelerates results. Use these benefits to align on value, set expectations, and help stakeholders understand what improves deliverability and engagement.

- **On‑brand copy**: Draft complete emails with Ask AI and your Brand Voice to reduce blank‑page time while staying consistent.

- **Faster experimentation**: Generate multiple subject lines and run a built‑in A/B test to improve opens and clicks.

- **Accurate targeting**: Pick from dynamic **Segments**, **Smart Lists**, tags, or pre‑built segments to reach the right audience.

- **Deliverability safeguards**: Guided setup for a **dedicated sending domain** with auto‑configure or manual DNS, plus **Default Headers** for DMARC alignment fallback.

- **Clear performance tracking**: View results in the **All‑in‑One Dashboard for Email Marketing** and related statistics pages.

* * *

## **On‑Brand Email Copy with Ask AI**

- This capability uses Content AI and your Brand Voice to convert a short brief into complete email copy. You can fine‑tune tone and intent, regenerate, or edit directly—so AI speeds you up without locking you in.

- Launch Ask AI from the campaign draft to generate body copy based on your prompt and tone.

- Connect your **Brand Voice** in Brand Boards to keep output consistent across emails, funnels, and social. ( [Create Emails with Content AI](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001236751-how-to-create-emails-using-content-ai-), [Brand Voice in Brand Boards](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005085-brand-voice-in-brand-boards), [Brand Voice in Content AI](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005308-brand-voice-integration-in-content-ai))

* * *

## **Subject Line A/B Testing**

Split testing removes guesswork from subject‑line performance. Define the number of variations, test duration, and winning metric; the winner sends to the remainder automatically.

- Test **up to 6 variations**; require **at least 10 contacts per variation** and **40 contacts total**.

- Choose winner by **Unique Open Rate** or **Unique Click Rate**.

- A/B testing is supported only for **Send Now** and **Schedule** delivery—not **Batch** or **RSS Schedule**.

* * *

## **Audience Targeting Options**

Selecting the right audience is as important as the message. Email Campaign Agent supports multiple targeting methods so you can balance speed with precision.

• **Segments (campaign builder)** – Real‑time, logic‑based groups built from engagement, tags, and fields; evaluated dynamically and reusable across campaigns.

• **Pre‑Built Segments** – One‑click picks like “Engaged last 7/30/60 days” or “Interacted with last 5 campaigns.” These snapshot at creation/scheduling time.

• **Smart Lists (Contacts → Smart Lists)** – Dynamic CRM views that update at **send time**; new matches are included and non‑matches are excluded.

• **Tags** – Use existing tags or add on the Send/Schedule page to organize audiences and automate downstream.

## **How To Setup Email Campaign Agent**

A concise, step-by-step path to launch a campaign using **Ask AI**. You’ll start by **prompting Ask AI** (not hunting menus), then follow a guided flow that can handle domain setup, copy generation, A/B testing, audience selection, and scheduling—so everything lands in the **Campaign Builder** ready to send.

1. Open **Ask AI** and prompt it to create your campaign



Example prompts: **“Create an email campaign”**, **“Email to promote my product.”**



Ask AI will recognize the task and start the **Email Campaign Agent** guided flow in the builder.

2. Review dedicated sending domain check (optional to skip)



The flow first checks if a **dedicated sending domain** is set up.



You can **complete the guided domain setup now** (recommended for deliverability) or **skip** and finish later.



If setup is needed, you’ll be shown the required DNS records (auto-configure where supported; manual copy/paste otherwise).

3. Answer Ask AI’s brief questions



Provide your **name of Campaign**, **offer/topic**, **audience intent**, and **tone**.



Ask AI builds a refined prompt, uses the information to **generate the email body**, and **pre-fills scheduling details**.

4. Connect your brand kit for consistent styling (Optional)



Ask AI can **link to your Brand Board/Brand Voice** so the copy and formatting match your brand guidelines.



You can adjust tone or regenerate content as needed.

5. Enable subject-line A/B testing (recommended)



Turn on **Subject Line Test** to generate multiple titles



Choose number of variations (up to **6**), sample size, test duration, and the winning metric (Unique Opens or Unique Clicks).



There is an Option to use "Default settings"

6. Choose your audience



Use **Pre-Built Segments**, **Tags**, or **Smart Lists** to target recipients now.

7. Review and confirm the Ask AI summary



Ask AI displays a quick summary card with your Campaign name, **Description**, **Goal**, **Audience** and **Send** status.



You’ll be prompted: **“Does this look correct? (Yes/No/Edit)”**.



Choose **Yes** to let the agent create the campaign and post **“All set! I’ve created the campaign.”** with a **Review & schedule here** link that opens the campaign in the **Campaign Builder**.

8. Launch and monitor results



Click **Launch Campaign** when ready.



After send, track engagement in your email dashboards; follow up as needed (e.g., resend to unopens where applicable).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I edit the AI‑written content before sending?**

Yes. You can freely edit, re‑generate, and format the output from Ask AI prior to launch.

**Q: How many subject‑line variations can I test, and what are the rules?**

Up to **6** variations; minimum **10 contacts per variation** and **40 total** contacts. A/B tests support **Send Now** and **Schedule** only (not Batch/RSS).

**Q: Do Smart Lists or Segments update after I schedule?**

**Smart Lists** are evaluated at **send time** and update dynamically; **Pre‑Built Segments** snapshot at create/schedule; **Segments** in the builder are dynamic by design.

**Q: Where do I see results after I send?**

Use **Marketing → Emails → Statistics** (All‑in‑One Email Dashboard) for unified metrics across Campaigns, Workflows, and Bulk Actions.

SMTP integrations typically only show **opens** and **clicks**; **delivered/bounced** require Mailgun/LC Email. ( [Troubleshooting Email Statistics](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001208601-troubleshooting-email-statistics))

**Q: Can I resend to contacts who didn’t open my email?**

Yes, **Resend to Unopened** is supported for **RSS** and **Batch** scheduled campaigns (as well as Send Now).
