**In this article, we will discuss how the WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check condition can be used to create automated workflows and send free form messages. This powerful condition lets you determine whether an active Customer Service Window is open between your business and your customer. When the window is open, you can send unlimited free-form messages at no cost for the first 1,000 service conversations each month.**

# Prerequisite for using WhatsApp under Workflows

WhatsApp needs to be subscribed and enabled on a the location account. You can refer to the below article for setting up WhatsApp on your sub account. [WhatsApp Subaccount Setup](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000001980?portalId=48000045315#Subaccount-Setup).

Additionally if you want to send business initiated conversations then please ensure that you have an approved template in place. [How to create a WhatsApp Template](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000861-how-to-create-a-whatsapp-template-)

# What are Conversations

Conversations are 24-hour message threads between you and your customers and are the basis for pricing. Conversations can be opened by sending either free-form messages or template messages.

Conversations are opened when you send a message to a customer under the following conditions.

### 1\. Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations

When you send an approved marketing, utility, or authentication template to a customer, we check if an open conversation matching the template's category already exists between you and the customer. If one exists, no new conversation is opened. If one does not exist, a new conversation of that category is opened, lasting 24 hours.

For example:

- Hour 0: You send a targeted promotion (marketing template message) to a customer. No open marketing conversation exists between you and the customer, so a marketing conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.
- Hour 4: The customer completes an order on your site, so you send them an order confirmation (utility template message). No open utility conversation exists between you and the customer, so a utility conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.
- Hour 10: You send a shipment confirmation (utility template message) to the customer. An open utility conversation already exists between you and the customer, so a new utility conversation is not opened.

### 2\. Service Conversations

A service conversation is opened when any message other than a template message is delivered to your customer and no open conversation of any category exists between you and the customer.

```
Note that a customer service window must exist between you and the customer before you can send them a non-template message
```

For example:

- Hour 0: You send a targeted promotion (marketing template) to a customer. No open marketing conversation exists between you and the customer, so a marketing conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.
- Hour 4: The customer messages you. This opens a customer service window between you and the customer, allowing you to send them any type of message for the next 24 hours.
- Hour 5: You send an interactive list message to the customer. An open conversation already exists between you and the customer (a marketing conversation in this case), so a service conversation is not opened.
- Hour 24: The marketing conversation expires.
- Hour 25: The 24-hour customer service window is still open, so you send a second text message to the customer. No open conversation exists between you and the customer anymore, so a service conversation is opened, lasting 24 hours.
- Hour 26: The 24-hour customer service window is still open, so you send a third text message to the customer. An open service conversation already exists between you and the customer, so a new service conversation is not opened.

# What is a Customer Service Window

When a WhatsApp user messages you, a 24-hour timer called a customer service window starts (or refreshes).

# Free Tier Conversations

Each WhatsApp Business Account gets 1,000 free service conversations each month across all of its business phone numbers. This number is refreshed at the beginning of each month, based on WhatsApp Business Account time zone.

Marketing, utility and authentication conversations are not part of the free tier.

# How to use WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check

To send free-form messages to your customers, you first need to verify if the customer service window is open. If it is, you can proceed with sending the free-form message. Responding to a customer's inbound message automatically opens a service conversation. You can initiate up to 1,000 free service conversations each month, helping you reduce your messaging costs.

**Step 1:** Go to **Automations > Workflows > Create Workflow > Start from Scratch**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032110933/original/dhgXLmbZK6BUiWao0efgrITVnawa0U_GYA.png?1725326485)**

**Step 2:** Click on the plus button to add an action > Select **WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032064326/original/5Wu83WCEBufxxBUQgacV5vC9YJg-2iHmGg.png?1725273049)**

**Step 3**: In this step, you can choose the conversation's phone number.

```
If Customer Service Window is open, then you can send unlimited free-form messages. If Customer Service Window is closed, then you need to send a Marketing or Utility template to start a conversation with the customer
```

**Ste** **p 4:** Under **Open** branch, select **WhatsApp** action and select template as **None - Free form message**

```
If the customer service window is open, then you can send unlimited free form messages to customer, each WABA account gets 1000 free service conversations every month, meaning you can get send these messages for free to your customers until your 1000 service conversations are used up.
```

**Step 5:** Under Closed branch, select **WhatsApp** action and select marketing/utility template to intitate conversation with the customer

```
If the customer service window is closed, meaning that there is not customer reply in the last 24 hour, then you can only send WhatsApp marketing or utility templates
```

# FAQs

## **What's the difference between "None - Free form message" and selecting a template when sending WhatsApp messages in workflows?**

"**None - Free form message**" lets you write a free-form message within the 24-hour customer service window. Selecting a template is for sending pre-approved messages, which is useful for starting conversations outside of the 24-hour window or for specific marketing or support purposes.

## **Where can I check my free tier conversation count**

You can go to [Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/insights/), select your WhatsApp account. Go to account tools > Insights

## **Can I create workflows that combine WhatsApp with other channels like SMS or Email?**

Yes! GoHighLevel workflows are flexible, allowing you to combine WhatsApp with other communication channels to create comprehensive automation sequences.

## **Can I use WhatsApp workflow automation to send messages outside the 24-hour customer service window?**

Yes, you can use approved WhatsApp templates after the 24 hour customer service window is closed, for outreach or follow-up messages. Keep in mind that these template-based messages will incur additional charges.

## **What's a 'Free Entry Point Conversation' and how is it different from a regular conversation?**

- Triggered when a customer clicks a "Click to WhatsApp" ad or a Facebook Call-to-Action button.
- Lasts for 72 hours, compared to the standard 24-hour window.
- During this extended window, you can send both free-form and template messages.
