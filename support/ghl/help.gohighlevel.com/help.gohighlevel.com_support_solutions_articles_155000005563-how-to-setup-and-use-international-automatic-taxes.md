# **What is International Automatic Taxes?**

International Automatic Taxes is a HighLevel feature that automates tax calculation for businesses operating in multiple countries. It supports VAT and other local tax types, automatically applying the correct taxes at checkout or invoice payment based on the customer’s address and your business’s tax obligations. This feature works across all checkout types, including Funnels, Payment Links, Invoices, Estimates, and Ecommerce Stores, and is compatible with all payment providers.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of International Automatic Taxes**

International Automatic Taxes streamlines global tax compliance and simplifies the checkout process for both businesses and customers. Here’s how it helps:

- Ensures accurate, compliant tax calculations for multiple countries, including VAT and local taxes.

- Supports bulk addition of countries or states where your business has tax obligations.

- Automatically applies taxes based on customer address, reducing manual errors.

- Allows entry and management of country-specific VAT IDs or local tax IDs for optimized tax handling.

- Works seamlessly across all checkout types and payment providers in HighLevel.

- Enables product-level tax configuration for granular control.

- Provides a guided migration flow for existing US Automatic Tax users.

- Centralizes tax settings for easy management and updates.

* * *

## **How To Setup and Use Automatic Taxes**

Setting up International Automatic Taxes ensures your business remains compliant and your customers are charged the correct tax amounts.

```
Note: It is your responsibility to comply with all relevant tax regulations in each jurisdiction where taxes are collected or remitted.
```

### **Step 1:** Access Tax Settings

1. Navigate to the **Payments** from the left-hand menu of your HighLevel account.

2. Click on the **Settings** tab within the Payments section.

3. Under Settings, select the **Taxes** sub-tab.

### **Step 2:** Enable Global Tax Settings

1. Locate the **Include Tax in Prices** option.

2. Select **Yes** or **No** depending on whether you want to have taxes included in prices or not included in prices.


   - Yes - This ensures taxes are always included in product price. The final total product price is fixed and the tax amount would vary on the tax rate but always calculated

     For example: You set the product price as $100. Now on the checkout if the tax rate determined is:
     - 10%, then the tax amount would be $9.1, while the total price with taxes remains as $100
     - 0%, then the tax amount would be $0, while the total price with taxes still remains as $100
     - 20%, then the tax amount would be $16.67, while the total price with taxes remains as $100
   - No - Select this option if you want product price to be a separate entity from taxes i.e. whatever is the tax amount should be additional to this price.

     For example: You set the product price as $100. Now on the checkout if the tax rate determined is:
     - 10%, then the tax amount would be $10 and the total price with taxes now becomes $110
     - 0%, then the tax amount would be $0 and the total price with taxes remains as $100
     - 20%, then the tax amount would be $20 and the total price with taxes now becomes $120

### **Step 3:** Enable Automatic Tax Calculation

1. Scroll down to find the **Automatic Taxes** section.

2. Toggle **Enable automatic tax** to ON.

### **Step 4:** Select Default Tax Category (Optional)

1. From the **Default Tax Category** dropdown, select one that best matches your business/products.


```
Note: Tax categories selected for individual Products will override the default category.
```

![](https://jumpshare.com/v/51rJgCg90YIE8BLq8xjx+/GIF+Recording+2025-07-01+at+1.39.56+AM.gif)

### **Step 5:** Add Nexus Address

1. Click **Add Nexus Address**.

2. From the dropdown, choose **County/Countries**.




   - If you select **United States**, you’ll can choose from all **58** states.

   - For **Canada**, you’ll can choose from **13** provinces/territories.

   - For other countries, selection is country-specific only.
3. Enter your **Tax ID** for each country or state. This ID will be considered during tax calculation at checkout if required by local regulations. (Optional)

4. Click Add to save the nexus address.

```
Note: Deleting a country with individually added states (e.g., Canada) also removes its states. Countries must be deleted one at a time.
```

- Taxes are applied automatically based on the **customer’s address**.




  - **Checkout.**

- The applied tax amount appears as a distinct line item on the customer’s payment summary.

- If a business **Tax ID** is configured for a region, it is considered in the tax calculation as per local tax rules.

* * *

## **Product-Level Tax Configuration**

Product-level tax codes allow for precise control over how taxes are applied to specific items.

1. Go to **Payments > Products**.

2. Either:




   - Click **Create Product**, or

   - Click the **three-dot** menu next to an existing product and choose **Edit**.
3. Scroll to the **Product Tax Code** section.

4. Select a **Tax Category** for the particular product from the dropdown.

5. Choose one of the following under **Include taxes in prices**:




   - **As per global settings** – Inherits the main toggle behavior.

   - **Yes** – Always includes tax for this product, regardless of global settings.

   - **No** – Never includes tax for this product, regardless of global settings.
6. Click **Save** to apply changes.

```
Note: If a specific tax code is not set manually for a product, the system will fall back to a default code that’s defined in your Global tax settings.
```

## **Migrating from the Old US Auto Tax System**

Accounts previously using the US-only automatic tax system can transition to the global tax system via a guided workflow in the **Automatic Taxes** settings page.

```
Important: The old US-only tax system will be deprecated before 1st September 2025, and accounts not migrated in time will have automatic tax calculations disabled until reconnected.
```

To migrate:

1. Click on **Payments** from your account.

2. Click on the **Settings** tab.

## **Managing Nexus Addresses**

Nexus addresses define where your business has a tax obligation. Properly managing these ensures taxes are applied only where required.

- Add or remove countries/states as your business expands or contracts.

- Deleting a country with separately added states (like Canada) will also remove those states from the Nexus Addresses list.

- Regularly review and update nexus addresses to stay compliant with changing regulations.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to configure taxes for every country where I sell products?**

Yes, you must add each country (or state, for US/Canada) where you have a tax obligation to ensure taxes are calculated correctly.

**Q: Can I edit my business’s Tax ID after adding it to a nexus address?**

Yes, Tax IDs can be edited at any time from the Nexus Addresses list.

**Q: Can I bulk-add countries and states for tax calculation?**

Yes, you can select and add multiple countries or states at once using the bulk-add feature.

**Q: How does tax calculation work at checkout?**

Taxes are calculated automatically based on:

- The customer’s billing or shipping address.
- The configured nexus locations.
- The product’s assigned tax code.
- Any associated Tax ID, if applicable.


The tax amount appears as a separate line item in the final order summary.

**Q: Which checkout types support automatic taxes?**

Automatic tax calculation works across Funnels, Payment Links, Invoices & Estimates, Ecommerce Store checkouts.

We recommend consulting a tax professional to ensure compliance with India’s GST and tax invoicing regulations.

**Q: Where can I check which Tax Code to use for different tax categories?**

You can view the tax category and code mapping here: **[View Tax Codes List](https://taxcode.avatax.avalara.com/)**. Use this list while assigning **Product Tax Codes** in your product settings to ensure accurate tax calculation during checkout and invoicing.

You can view and add automatic taxes on the following checkouts - Invoices & Estimates, Payment Links, Funnels and Ecommerce Stores.
