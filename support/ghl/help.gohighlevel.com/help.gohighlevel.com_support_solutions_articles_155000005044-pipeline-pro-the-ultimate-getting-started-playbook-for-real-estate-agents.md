### Why This Playbook Matters

You’re an expert at closing deals, hosting showings, and negotiating top dollar but how do you consistently bring in quality buyers and motivated sellers without burning out?

Most agents rely on referrals, pay-per-lead platforms, or inconsistent outreach.

But here’s the reality:

✅ 97% of home buyers begin their journey online

✅ 70% of sellers hire the first agent who follows up

✅ Agents with 50+ Google reviews appear in 2x more searches

✅ Speed + automation = more deals, more time, more profit

If you’re not ranking, not following up fast, or missing key operational systems — you’re already behind.

This HighLevel Playbook gives you the 5 foundational steps to attract more leads, respond faster, stay organized, and close deals consistently — without hiring a full team.

* * *

## What You’ll Learn:

✅ How to dominate Google & get found by local buyers & sellers

✅ How to follow up instantly, even when you're at a showing

✅ How to turn happy clients into 5-star reviews and referrals

✅ How to run effective lead ads that book consults

✅ How to stay top of mind on social with zero manual work

* * *

## Step 1: Dominate Google Search & Attract Local Leads

### Why It Matters

92% of sellers search “realtor near me” before calling.

Agents with 50+ reviews and an optimized Google Business Profile get 2–3x more leads.

### Real Estate Use Case Example:

Pain: Agent losing listings to competitors with stronger online presence

Solution: Optimized Google Business Profile + weekly automated posts from HighLevel

#### [How to Set Up Google Business Profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177?hl=en)

#### [How to Optimize Your Google Business Profile](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222899-how-to-integrate-your-google-business-profile-formerly-gmb-into-the-crm)

### First Actions:

✅ Claim and fully optimize your Google Business Profile (GBP)

✅ List all areas/neighborhoods you serve to improve ranking

✅ Use HighLevel call tracking numbers to see which channels work

✅ Automate review requests after closings

✅ Schedule weekly updates to your GBP

**Example Google Post:**

"Just sold this 3-bed in Westfield — 6 offers in 48 hours. Thinking of selling? Let’s talk strategy."

* * *

## Step 2: Automate Lead Follow-Ups & Book More Consults

### Why It Matters

78% of leads go with the first agent who responds.

Follow-ups = listings.

#### [Setting up Missed Call Text Back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001239140-where-and-how-to-configure-the-missed-call-text-back-feature)  ✅ Use HighLevel booking links for buyer/seller consults  ✅ Build follow-up automations triggered by form submissions, FB ads, or Zillow leads

## Step 3: Automate Reviews & Build Referral Power

### Why It Matters

90% of buyers and sellers read online reviews before choosing an agent.

Reputation = authority.

### Real Estate Use Case Example:

Pain: Happy clients, but no reviews or testimonials to show for it

Solution: Automated review requests via SMS/email after every closing

### First Actions:

✅ Create a review workflow that sends automatically after deal closes

✅ Direct clients to leave reviews on Google, Zillow, and Facebook

✅ Get notified of any low ratings to fix before they go public

✅ Post 5-star reviews across social profiles and websites

**Example Review Request:**

"Congrats on the new home, Sarah! If you enjoyed working together, would you mind sharing a quick review? It helps a ton! \[Link\]"

Only 5–10% of your audience sees organic posts.

Targeted ads bring high-intent leads directly into your pipeline.

Solution: A $200 Facebook lead ad campaign offering free home valuations generates 12 leads in 6 days

### First Actions:

✅ Launch Google Local Services Ads (LSA) for “Realtor near me” keywords

✅ Run Facebook Lead Ads offering home valuation or buyer list

#### [How to Run Facebook Ads from HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002435-create-new-ad-campaign-in-ad-manager)  ✅ Use HighLevel to instantly sync leads with follow-up workflows

* * *

## Step 5: Stay Consistent on Social (Without Doing It Manually)

Agents who post consistently stay top of mind and get 30% more repeat business.

But you can’t grow if you’re stuck writing posts all day.
