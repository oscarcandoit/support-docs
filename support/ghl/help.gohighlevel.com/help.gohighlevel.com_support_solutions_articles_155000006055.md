## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How many additional domain extensions can I purchase at a time?**

You can select up to 3 additional domain suggestions along with your main domain.

**Q: Is it mandatory to purchase the recommended additional extensions?**

No, you can opt to purchase a standalone domain without selecting any additional extensions.

**Q: Will there be extra costs for these additional domain extensions?**

Yes, the extra cost is clearly displayed during the purchase process, providing complete pricing transparency.

**Q: Can I add additional domain extensions to an already owned domain?**

Absolutely – if you own a domain, a “Protect your brand” banner in the domain details page allows you to purchase additional extensions.

****Q: Will adding extensions impact DNS for my current primary domain?****

No. Purchasing an additional extension creates a separate domain with its own DNS zone. Its records are managed independently inside HighLevel and do not change the DNS of your existing primary domain unless you explicitly edit records or set up redirects.
