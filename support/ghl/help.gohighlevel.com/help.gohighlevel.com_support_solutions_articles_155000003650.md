## **What is the Affiliate Portal?**

The Affiliate Portal is a centralized platform where affiliates can manage various aspects of their affiliate marketing efforts. It provides access to performance statistics, commission information, customer data, and more. By logging into the portal, affiliates can track their leads, payments, and campaign success, all while easily accessing their referral links and important affiliate program details.

* * *

## **How to Get Started with the Affiliate Portal**

### **Step 1: Adding Affiliates to a Campaign**

Once an affiliate is added to an active campaign, they will receive an invitation email to access the Affiliate Portal. Ensure that the "Invite Email" option is toggled on in the campaign settings.

You can also automate welcome emails or SMS messages with details on how affiliates can get started. Learn more \[here\].

### **Step 2: Affiliate Login**

Affiliates can log in using the credentials provided in their invitation email. Once inside, they will be directed to the **Affiliate Dashboard** where they can view their campaign data and affiliate links.

* * *

## **What Can Affiliates See in the Portal?**

### **Dashboard Screen**

Affiliates can view all the campaigns they are part of and see key metrics such as leads, customers, clicks, and commissions. They also have quick access to their referral links.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804099/original/5zi5NolMEZF2gRuIVL462n9fxnAtF9OCDw.jpeg?1727703015)

### **Leads/Customers Screen**

This screen provides detailed insights into the leads and customers who signed up or purchased a product through the affiliate’s referral links, allowing them to track the effectiveness of their promotional efforts.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804101/original/uM3kHWMqCwyPJt80fPhpJYPppFMfv027Vg.jpeg?1727703015)

### **Commission Screen**

Affiliates can view the commissions they’ve earned, the total revenue generated, and the status of their payouts.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033804100/original/a8UoJ3lI7MKWLAuSK-0DvEBPNlc2AfomFg.jpeg?1727703015)

### **Sub-Affiliate Page**

If the affiliate program includes sub-affiliates, the affiliate can see their sub-affiliates listed here. If sub-affiliate sign-up is enabled, affiliates will also see a form URL they can share to onboard others as sub-affiliates.

By utilizing the Affiliate Portal, affiliates can effectively monitor their progress, strategize future campaigns, and maintain clear communication with your business. This streamlined experience allows for better engagement and performance across your affiliate network.

## **Configuring Affiliate Portal**

The **Affiliate Portal Settings** section allows you to control what affiliates see and do inside their dashboard — including uploading tax forms, setting up payout methods, and more. This guide will walk you through how to configure these settings.

### **? Where to Find Affiliate Portal Settings**

1. Navigate to **Affiliate Manager** from the left-hand menu of your sub-account.

2. Click on the **Settings** tab at the top.

3. Switch to the **Affiliate Portal Settings** tab.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044871354/original/MQqHismdOQ09h0Vp7DzxDqk76zmBnQDZKg.png?1744283236)


* * *

### **⚙️ What You Can Configure**

Here are the settings you can toggle ON/OFF based on your needs:

1\. ✅ **Ask Affiliates to Upload W9/W8 Forms**

- **What it does:**

Displays a banner on the affiliate dashboard prompting them to upload the required tax form (W9 or W8).
- **Why it's important:**

Ensures tax compliance and prevents payout delays.

2\. ? **Require Affiliates to Set Up a Payout Method**

- **What it does:**

Shows a banner on the affiliate dashboard nudging them to set up a valid payout method (e.g., PayPal or Banks).
- **Why it's important:**

Reduces manual follow-ups and enables timely payouts.

3\. ? **Mask Referral Emails on Affiliate Dashboard**

- **What it does:**

Hides a portion of the referral emails (e.g., john\*\*\*\*@gmail.com) visible to affiliates.
- **Why it's important:**

Protects customer and lead privacy.

4\. ⚙️ **Configure Payout Methods**

- **What it does:**

Lets you choose which payout methods are available for affiliates to select (only those enabled will be shown in the portal).
- **Why it's important:**

Gives you control over how commissions are paid out.

* * *

### **✅ How to Enable or Disable a Setting**

1. In the **Affiliate Portal Settings** tab, locate the toggle you want to change.

2. Click the toggle to enable (green) or disable (gray) it.

3. Once you’ve adjusted your settings, scroll to the bottom and click **Save**.


* * *

### **? Best Practices**

- Always enable at least one payout method to avoid affiliate confusion.

- Use masking if your campaigns are sensitive or you want to limit affiliate access to lead details.
