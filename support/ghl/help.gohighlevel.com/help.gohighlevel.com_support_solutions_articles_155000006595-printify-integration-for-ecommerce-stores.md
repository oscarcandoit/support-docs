# **What is Printify Integration?**

Printify Integration connects your HighLevel Ecommerce store to Printify’s print-on-demand (POD) platform. Once connected, you can import products you designed in Printify, automatically forward customer orders for production, and receive real-time fulfillment updates—so you can sell custom goods with zero upfront stock risk. Print-on-demand lets items be printed only after a sale is made, freeing you from inventory costs and bulk-order commitments.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Printify Integration**

- **Fast launches:** Access 1,000+ customizable products to spin up new lines quickly.

- **Regional speed & pricing:** Tap 85+ print providers for competitive rates and quicker local delivery.

- **Always accurate listings:** Variants, prices, and images sync automatically.

- **Hands-off fulfillment:** Orders auto-push to Printify and go to production—no manual re-entry.

- **End-to-end tracking:** Get automatic partial and complete fulfillment updates.

- **Multi-store control:** Manage multiple storefronts from one Printify account and view performance by location.

* * *

## **Important Notes & Limitations**

- Imported products **publish live by default**—double-check before you launch sales.

- Uninstalling the integration **does NOT delete previously imported products**.

- Printify only creates an order if a print provider can fulfill the destination country, variant, and shipping method you selected.

- All design work happens inside Printify; HighLevel only manages **inventory** and **orders** for **already**- **synced** **items**.

- You’ll need a **Printify** **API** **token** to authenticate the connection.

* * *

## **How To Generate Printify API Token**

1. Log in to Printify and click on **Account**.

2. Click on **Connections.**

3. Click on the Generate button under **API Tokens**.
