# Remediate 'Spam Likely' on your Caller ID using Free Caller Registry

Modified on: Thu, 7 Aug, 2025 at 5:45 AM

**Overview**

In this article, we will learn how we can increase our call answer rates by remediating 'spam likely' / 'potential spam' / 'scam likely' on the caller ID in the US (US only).

If the phone number flagged as 'spam likely' is relatively new or not critical to your business or has a FTC complaint, we recommend trashing the phone number and getting a new one. It's faster, easier and more convenient for you as compared to remediating the 'spam likely' tag.

If you have an EIN and your number is flagged as **‘Spam Likely’**, we recommend registering through **Voice Integrity**, available in the HighLevel portal. For full steps, see our article: [Why are my Calls marked as Spam, and How can I avoid it ?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001231665)

If you **don’t have an EIN**, we suggest registering your number with the Free call registry instead.

* * *

**What is Voice Integrity?**

Voice Integrity is a game-changing feature that helps protect your business calls from being flagged as “Spam Likely.” By registering your U.S.-based phone numbers with top caller ID analytics providers—First Orion, Hiya, and TNS—you can improve pickup rates and reinforce your brand’s trustworthiness.

# **Why Turn On Voice Integrity?**

If your business numbers are flagged or blocked, Voice Integrity helps you:

- **Fix bad reputations** and clear “Spam Likely” labels from legitimate calls.

- **Increase pickup rates**—recipients are more likely to answer when your caller ID shows a verified, trusted name.

- **Ensure your calls are seen as authentic**, not suspicious.

- Boost **call answer rates** with a verified and trusted caller ID

- Help prevent your numbers from being **blocked** or **ignored**

- Maintain a **positive caller reputation** over time

- Establish **trust and credibility** with recipients

- Support consistent **branding** through accurate caller ID display


## **What You Need to Get Started**

Before activating Voice Integrity, ensure you meet these requirements:

- **SHAKEN/STIR Certification** (Required):

Confirms your calls are legitimate and not spoofed.

- **CNAM Registration** (Recommended):

Displays your business name as the caller ID, increasing credibility.

- **U.S. Phone Numbers Only**:

Currently, Voice Integrity applies only to U.S.-based numbers. International traffic is not supported.


**Note**\- **An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is required to complete SHAKEN/STIR registration.** If you don’t have an EIN, we recommend registering your number with the Free call registry instead.

# What is Free Caller Registry?

Carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon use analytics engines to generate and maintain spam scores for caller IDs. These 3 carriers have different analytics engines. All the 3 analytics engines partnered to create Free Caller Registry where you can submit a single request and all of them will re-consider the 'spam likely' tag on your caller ID.

# How to submit a request on Free Caller Registry?
