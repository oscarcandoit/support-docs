# **What are Snippets?**

Snippets are reusable templates for text or email messages, created to help teams maintain consistent communication. By using Snippets, you can save time crafting repetitive messages, ensuring accuracy and on-brand tone in every interaction. These templates can be quickly inserted into conversations, making customer communication faster and more efficient. Snippets also support customization with placeholders like names or trigger links, making them versatile for different contexts.

## **Benefits Of Using Snippets**

Communication inefficiencies can lead to delays, inconsistent messaging, and missed opportunities to engage with customers effectively. Snippets solve these problems by:

- Reducing time spent typing repetitive messages.

- Ensuring a consistent tone and language across teams.

- Increasing productivity by offering pre-organized, ready-to-use templates.
