Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 11:03 AM

The Bulk Actions page now uses HighLevel’s unified UX for faster filtering, clearer status tracking, and one-click access to job metrics and error logs—so you can audit, troubleshoot, and, when applicable, restore deleted contacts with confidence.

# **What is the Bulk Actions Page?**

The Bulk Actions page is a central dashboard that lists mass operations initiated from Contacts (e.g., imports, tag updates, bulk messaging, and deletions). It provides live status, outcome metrics, and access to detailed logs so teams can verify results and correct issues quickly.

The page displays each bulk job in a table with columns like Action Name, Action Type, Created By, Created At, and Status. From here, you can open **Show Stats** for detailed results or use the row’s action menu for management options (e.g., pause/cancel for eligible jobs, and restore for supported deletion jobs).

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Bulk Actions Page**

Understanding what this page does best helps you use it for speed, accuracy, and accountability across your CRM workflows.

- **Unified UX**: A consistent HighLevel interface with cleaner tables, readable spacing, and predictable controls.

- **Faster troubleshooting**: Open **Show Stats** to compare successes vs. errors and download error logs for fixes.

- **Operational safety**: For supported deletion jobs, queue a **Restore** within the allowed window to recover deleted **contacts**.

- **Team accountability**: Filter by **Status**, **Action Type**, **User**, and **Date** to see who did what and when.

- **Traceability**: Keep an auditable trail by exporting detailed error logs from the Stats view.


* * *

## **Viewing the Bulk Actions Table**

Learn how to read the table and interpret status indicators so you can prioritize jobs that need attention.

- Each job appears as a row with a clear **Status** (for example, _In Progress_, _Completed_, or _Canceled_).

- Status badges are color-coded, and hovering tooltips can reveal longer action names or counts.

- Use the row’s **three‑dot menu** for available controls (e.g., pause/cancel for bulk sends; restore where applicable).


* * *

## **Using Filters to Find Bulk Actions Fast**

Filters help you zero in on the exact jobs you care about—especially helpful for audits or when multiple team members run actions daily.

- **Status** – Narrow to jobs that are In Processing, Complete, Paused, Queued or Cancelled.

- **Action Type** – Focus on specific operations like **Import**, **Delete Contacts**, **Add Tag**, **Remove Tag**, **Bulk SMS**, or **Bulk Email**.

- **User** – See jobs initiated by a specific team member.

- **Date Range** – Use custom dates.

* * *

## **Viewing Job Stats & Downloading Error Logs**

Stats give you an at‑a‑glance read on what happened during a bulk job, and downloadable logs make it easy to fix issues and re‑run cleanly.

- Click **Show Stats** on any row to open a details drawer with high‑level metrics (totals, success/error counts, and relevant delivery outcomes for messaging jobs).

- Use the **Download** option in the Stats view to export an **error log** for troubleshooting. The log typically includes identifiers for failed records and a reason you can act on.

## **Restoring Deleted Contacts (from a Bulk Deletion Job)**

Restore is designed for recovering accidentally deleted **contacts**—not for undoing other types of bulk actions.

- When a **Delete Contacts** bulk job is eligible, you’ll see a **Restore** option. Selecting it opens a confirmation dialog that explains what will be reinstated.

- **Timing:** Deleted contacts can typically be restored within **about 60 days** of deletion. After that period, recovery isn’t available.

- Submitting the confirmation enqueues a **new restore job**, which will appear in the Bulk Actions table and run to completion.

* * *

## **Managing Running Jobs (Pause/Cancel for Eligible Actions)**

Some bulk sends—like SMS campaigns—can be paused or canceled after they’ve been queued, giving you control when plans change.

- Open the **three‑dot menu** for a running, eligible job to see **Pause, Edit** or **Cancel**.

- **Pause** temporarily stops processing; **Cancel** stops remaining processing and **Edit** enables user to change the schedule time of that bulk action. Items already processed remain as-is.

- After adjusting, refresh the Bulk Actions table and open **Show Stats** to verify what was completed before the change.

3. Click **Show Stats** on a job to review totals and error details; use **Download** to export the error log.

4. For **Delete Contacts** jobs within the allowed window, use **Restore** (when available) to re‑create deleted **contacts**.

5. For eligible queued sends (e.g., SMS), use the **three‑dot menu** to **Pause, Edit** or **Cancel**.
