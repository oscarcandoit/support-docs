# Managing Granular Permissions for Payments

Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 9:43 AM

HighLevel’s granular payment permissions let you delegate payment-related tasks safely by controlling exactly who can view, create, edit, refund, export, or configure each area of Payments. This guide defines every permission category, explains common role presets, and shows how to set up access the right way. Use it to speed up onboarding while protecting revenue operations and auditability.

## **What is Granular Payment Permissions?**

Granular payment permissions divide the former single Payments access into focused categories—Orders, Subscriptions, Transactions, Taxes, Products, and Payment Settings—each with standardized actions. This structure gives administrators precise control so teammates get only the access needed for their jobs without exposing sensitive operations.

Granular payment permissions are role-based access controls at the **Location** (sub-account) level that determine which users can **View, Create, Update, Delete, Export,** and **Configure** items across the Payments module. Administrators can combine categories to tailor access for support, accounting, fulfillment, and management teams.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Granular Payment Permissions**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide which actions to allow per team. The goal is to reduce risk without slowing down day-to-day work.

- **Minimize risk:** Restrict high-impact actions (like refunds, product deletion, or tax configuration) to trusted users only.

- **Faster onboarding:** Assign just the categories and actions each role needs so new hires can start safely.

- **Cleaner audits:** Narrow permissions make it easier to trace who changed what and when using **Audit Logs**.

- **Operational clarity:** Clear categories reduce confusion about where tasks live (e.g., refunds vs. order edits).

- **Workflow control:** Bulk, import, and export capabilities may be restricted based on a user’s permissions, protecting data quality.

* * *

## **What’s New & Changed in Payments Permissions**

Understanding what changed from the previous single Payments toggle helps admins migrate confidently and set accurate expectations for staff. These updates streamline assignment, improve auditability, and reduce the risk of granting overly broad access.

- **Permissions re‑homed:** Existing capabilities such as **Refund Transactions** and **Manage Subscriptions** now live inside their dedicated categories (Transactions and Subscriptions), making it easier to grant research access without refund rights, or subscription oversight without full payments access.

- **Standardized actions:** Each category now uses a consistent action set — **View, Create, Update, Delete, Export, Configure** — so roles are simpler to compare, train on, and audit across Payments.

- **UI‑enforced dependencies:** Certain high‑impact tools depend on foundational permissions. For example, **bulk product actions and CSV imports require Create/Update access**, preventing accidental multi‑record changes by read‑only users.

- **Tighter control of sensitive operations:** Admins can explicitly decide who may issue refunds, edit subscriptions, or adjust tax settings, increasing financial control while preserving day‑to‑day efficiency.

* * *

## **Orders Permissions**

Orders permissions govern one‑time orders and charges created through Payment Links, checkout pages, stores, and POS. Use these for teams that process orders and need read/export access, with editing reserved for responsible owners.

**Recommended role fit:** Fulfillment or support teams that need to look up orders, export lists, and perform limited adjustments.

* * *

## **Subscriptions Permissions**

Subscriptions permissions cover recurring billing lifecycles—creating plans, assigning subscriptions to contacts, pausing/resuming, canceling, and making updates like payment method changes. Grant these to roles responsible for subscription health and churn prevention.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054980224/original/MTdvdd83enOr1SWGs093SwXj7FwhTPpzgQ.png?1759303088)

**Recommended role fit:** Finance/Billing teams and Account Managers who own subscription health and retention; grant View to support and limit Create/Update/Cancel to designated owners.

* * *

## **Transactions Permissions**

Transactions permissions apply to completed payments and refunds. These are sensitive because they allow refunding money and downloading official receipts, so keep tight control and separate “view” from “refund” when possible.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054980262/original/CEv-bTfSxhXMNMpepwR9iGHDg3HDDXtWcg.png?1759303119)

**Recommended role fit:** Billing Support for research (View/Export/Receipts) and Controllers/Accountants for refunds; restrict refund rights to finance leads only.

* * *

## **Taxes Permissions**

Taxes permissions control who can configure or adjust tax behavior, including manual rates and automatic tax calculation features. Because tax settings impact compliance, reserve these permissions for finance owners.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054980290/original/a3uGaX2G3hQpnn4Sk4ykQIySDI12G-DDnA.png?1759303154)

**Recommended role fit:** Accountant/Controller or Finance Admin responsible for compliance; avoid granting Configure/Delete to non‑finance users.

## **Products Permissions**

Products permissions determine who can create, edit, duplicate, import/export, or delete products—changes that cascade to Payment Links, stores, and checkout pages. Limit destructive actions and require review for catalog changes.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054980302/original/m0yCgNs6TIOEizAmaLnY5pRWhxz0LZEeDA.png?1759303170)

**Recommended role fit:** Store Manager or Product/Catalog Owner for day‑to‑day updates; reserve Import/Export/Delete for administrators.

* * *

## **Payment Settings Permissions**

Payment Settings permissions cover global payment preferences such as receipts, subscription defaults, and payment-related notifications. These shape the customer experience and should be restricted to administrators and brand owners.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054980311/original/b4YbAGTiagpNZstE6SPHYj9p1m7bt0xFPw.png?1759303193)

**Recommended role fit:** Administrators or Brand/Finance Owners who manage receipts, defaults, and notifications; keep configuration centralized.

## **How To Set Up Granular Payment Permissions**

Proper setup ensures users can complete their tasks without unnecessary risk. Follow these steps to assign only the access required and verify the results.

1. Go to **Sub-Account** **Settings → My Staff**, locate the user, and click the pencil (edit) icon.



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054983320/original/pzOCaMK00vyyHdOiYXEe4eS7DqNlSqKbJg.png?1759305479)

2. Expand the **Roles & Permissions** section and select the required category

3. For each category - Orders, Subscriptions, Transactions, Taxes, Products, Payment Settings—toggle the actions the role needs ( **View, Create, Update, Delete, Export, Configure**). Some bulk/import/export actions may be unavailable to users without create/update privileges.



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054983292/original/5gFD7-EtbDhYb0b116gpfk6T53-hd9Ls4A.gif?1759305452)

4. Click **Save**.

5. (Optional) Click **Copy Permissions** to apply the same configuration to another user.

6. Have the user sign out and back in (if needed) and validate access using a test record (e.g., open a product, view a transaction).

## **Recommended Role Presets**

These presets are non-binding recommendations that map common job functions to safer permission sets. Always adapt to your organization’s policies.

Example presets (summary)

| Role | Settings Category | Sub Settings (actions) | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Billing Support** | Transactions | **View, Export, Download Receipt** _(Refund OFF)_ | Allow research and receipts without refund authority. Elevate temporarily if a supervised refund is required. |
| Subscriptions | **View, Pause/Resume/Cancel** | Avoid Create/Update/Cancel unless the team is trained to manage lifecycle changes. |
| Orders | **View, Export** | Useful for answering order status questions. Consider Update only for senior agents. |
| Products | **View** | Catalog visibility only; no edits. |
| Payment Settings | — | Keep configuration with admins/finance. |
| **Fulfillment / Store Manager** | Orders | **View, Export, Update** _(Create optional, Delete OFF)_ | Supports shipping/adjustments. Keep Delete to admins. |
| Products | **View, Update** _(Create for catalog owner; Import/Export OFF; Delete OFF)_ | Bulk/import may require Create/Update; restrict to trained owners. |
| Transactions | **View** | No refund capability. Escalate refund requests to finance. |
| Subscriptions | **View (optional)** | For context only; lifecycle changes handled by AM/Finance. |
| **Account Manager** | Subscriptions | **View, Create, Update, Pause/Resume/Cancel, Export** | Owns subscription health, renewals, and churn prevention; manages card updates when required. |
| Transactions | **View** | Research billing history; no refunds. |
| Orders | **View** | Context for customer conversations. |
| Products | **View (optional)** | Read-only product context for pricing discussions. |
| **Accountant / Controller** | Transactions | **View, Export, Refund** | Refunds restricted to finance leads; monitor via Audit Logs. |
| Taxes | **View, Configure, Update, Delete** | Sensitive. Limit to qualified finance staff; deleting/replacing rates requires care. |
| Payment Settings | **Configure, Update** | Controls receipts, defaults, and payment notifications. |
| Orders | **View** | Read-only operational context. |
| Products | **View, Export (optional)** | Export for reconciliation; avoid edits unless necessary. |
| **Administrator** | All (Orders, Subscriptions, Transactions, Taxes, Products, Payment Settings) | **View, Create, Update, Delete, Export, Configure** _(as applicable)_ | Full control for a minimal, trained admin group. Use Delete sparingly; enforce change management and reviews. |

```
Tip: Use Copy Permissions on the user record to replicate a tested configuration for similar roles.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do permissions affect CSV imports/exports in Payments?**

Yes. Import/export capabilities may be restricted based on a user’s assigned actions and role. If a user can’t see bulk tools, have an admin review their Create/Update/Export permissions for that category.

**Q: Can someone research transactions without being able to refund?**

Yes. Grant **Transactions — View** (and Export if needed) while limiting **refund** access to finance owners.

**Q: Will disabling Products permissions break existing checkout or payment links?**

No. Live checkout experiences continue to sell as configured. However, the user won’t be able to edit the underlying products or links.

**Q: Where can I see who changed a product, tax setting, or payment preference?**

Use **Audit Logs** to review user actions and changes. Agency admins can access logs at the agency level, and asset-level audit logs are available for funnels, websites, and stores.

**Q: Are granular payment permissions available at the agency level?**

Payments permissions are assigned at the **Location** level. Agency users manage users and roles at the agency scope, and those assignments can stack with or supersede location roles depending on configuration.

**Q: What happens if a user reports that buttons are greyed out in Payments?**

This usually indicates insufficient permissions for create/update or export in that category. Review their role configuration or temporarily test with an admin role to confirm.

**Q: Do Taxes permissions include automatic calculation features?**

Yes, where available. Finance owners can enable and manage automatic tax calculation. Ensure addresses are captured on the payment experience for accurate results.
