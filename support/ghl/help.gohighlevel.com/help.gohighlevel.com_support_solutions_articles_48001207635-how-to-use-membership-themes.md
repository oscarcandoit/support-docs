# **Overview**

You can now customize the feel of your product pages using handpicked themes. Themes help you establish a custom brand identity and experience.

The customizations allow you to add a variety of styles to the products. Check out the help article below for more info on how to customize your memberships.

## **Step 1: Choose a product theme**

Creating a product will by default select the classic theme, but we provide different system themes to choose from to best match your digital product with your personal brand! Keep in mind that each Theme will provide a different look, feel, and overall experience for your Members

## **How to select a theme**

- Select the Product you wish to apply a theme
- Click Customize

**Please Note:**

```
When "save changes" button is clicked after customizing anything in the theme settings it will reflect in the preview.

Reset to default will change all the settings to default values of the theme.

If sections are customized after theme setting are changed, sections customization will override theme setting customizations.
```

## **Step 3: Apply or save your theme**

Now that you have picked a theme for your Product and customized your Product Pages, the last step is to apply it.

Once your theme is applied this will be the final preview your Members will see and interact with!

- Select your Product.
- Click Customize.
- Browse the theme gallery and click on apply for the theme you wish to apply
- Alternatively, you can choose to customize the theme and then apply by clicking on apply on the top right corner

## **Save Theme Button:**  Save the theme for global use in your location by using the save theme button. When you click on "save changes" the changes will only be stored for the theme and will not be available for global use.

## The theme can then be saved for global use in the locations if the user clicks on the "save theme" button.

**Please Note :**

```
"Save Theme" will save only the latest changes which are stored after save changes are clicked. All "unsaved changes" won't be reflected.

When a template is customized and saved for global use it won't affect all the other products which are already using the same theme.

When a user applies the theme again to a product the new changes should start reflecting.
```

**Applying the theme**

Apply a theme to a specific product

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48189521748/original/SJJlGJSJmMXVEoK-XqmUyJ9BVPCy3evUWQ.jpeg?1644600507)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48188471323/original/YTNVI1Y1QdLojnbIwWVPiche0ZKg0z1BWA.jpeg?1644413789)

Clicking on " **apply**" from the theme gallery will apply the theme to the product directly.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48189521757/original/vNNY5B5GSGrHn2tVGbiQOLqIJnjPeKEsyA.jpeg?1644600511)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48188471383/original/bOeOyX1k0nvskjbvO47uY6TZBmAwQszKRg.jpeg?1644413792)

You can customize the theme and then after clicking on save changes you can click on the apply button to apply the theme to the particular product. Apply button will change to applied.

**Please Note:**

```
When a theme is applied using the apply button it will only get applied to the selected product and  customization set won't be available globally to the t in the location.
```

# Save Changes:

Customize and save drafts of a theme at the product level. You can customize a system-generated theme and save it as a draft without applying it to any of the products.

When you click on " **save changes**" the changes will be stored for the theme as a draft.

The Draft theme (With changes) can be applied later to the product. Draft themes are not global and won't be available across all locations.

**Please Note :**

```
If "save changes" is clicked on a theme which is not applied to a product, then the theme will be updated with the changes and can be used in the same product at a later point. It won't change the theme properties globally.
```
