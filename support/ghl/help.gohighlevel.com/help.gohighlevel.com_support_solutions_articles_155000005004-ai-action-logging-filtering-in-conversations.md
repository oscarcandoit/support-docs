# **What is AI Action Logging in Conversations?**

AI Action Logging provides visibility into automated actions triggered by AI bots during conversations with leads and customers. This feature adds traceable log entries for each bot-initiated action, helping users better understand and manage AI automation.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of AI Action Logging & Filtering**

Gain deeper insight into how bots are operating within your conversations, helping you maintain better control and clarity over automations.

    •    Provides transparency on AI-triggered actions like field updates or workflow triggers.

    •    Simplifies troubleshooting and auditing of bot activity.

    •    Enables users to filter and review only AI-driven events.

    •    Clearly tags bot-booked appointments with their source.

    •    Improves operational visibility and accountability within Conversations AI.

    •    Builds confidence in the automation process by showing behind-the-scenes actions.

* * *

## **How To Use AI Action Logs & Filters**

Learn how to view and filter the new AI log entries directly in your Conversations panel to better track bot behavior.

    1\.    **Open the Conversations Panel** in your HighLevel account.

    2\.    Review conversation threads. AI actions such as:

    •    _“Workflow triggered by Bot”_

    •    _“Contact field updated by AI Employee”_

    •    _“Bot Stopped”_

will now appear as log entries.

    3\.    To **filter by AI Action Logs**:

    •    Click the **Filter icon** in the top-right corner of the Conversations panel.

    •    Choose **“AI Action Logs”** from the dropdown.

    •    The panel will display only the messages involving bot-triggered actions.

* * *

## **AI Action Logs**

AI Action Logs capture and display when a bot performs an automation task during a conversation. These logs make it easy to verify when and how the bot is interacting with the contact.

Types of actions logged include:

    •    Workflow triggered

    •    Contact field updated

    •    Stop bot command

These logs appear chronologically in the conversation thread, marked by an “AI Employee” label for clarity.

* * *

## **AI Action Log Filter**

The AI Action Log Filter allows you to narrow down the conversation to show only automated bot activities. This provides a cleaner view when troubleshooting or auditing AI behavior.

Use this feature to:

    •    Verify if a bot triggered the intended automation.

    •    Isolate only AI actions without scrolling through unrelated messages.

    •    Understand exactly what steps were taken automatically during a conversation.

* * *

## **Appointment Source Tagging**

Now when a bot books an appointment during a conversation, the appointment will automatically be tagged with the source **“Conversations AI.”** This creates more visibility into where your appointments are coming from and helps with tracking automation performance.

Benefits include:

    •    Knowing which bookings are driven by bots vs. human users.

    •    Improved attribution and performance tracking of bot campaigns.

    •    Easier segmentation or follow-up reporting based on source.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Where do AI Action Logs appear?**

They appear directly in the Conversations panel as part of the conversation stream, labeled with the AI Employee responsible.

**Q: Can I filter AI Action Logs from other messages?**

Yes. Use the “AI Action Logs” filter from the filter dropdown in the Conversations panel.

**Q: What kind of bot actions are currently logged?**

The logs include workflow triggers, contact field updates, and bot stop commands.

**Q: Will this work with all bots or just Conversations AI?**

This functionality applies specifically to bots created using **Conversations AI** and AI Employees.

**Q: What does the “Conversations AI” source mean on appointments?**

It identifies that the appointment was booked automatically by a bot, not manually by a user or staff member.

**Q: Can I export these logs?**

At this time, there is no direct export feature. You can take screenshots or manually copy the data for record-keeping.

* * *

## **Next Steps**

    •    Head to the Conversations panel and test the AI Action Logs in a live or test conversation.

    •    Use the new filter to review recent bot actions and verify automations are working as intended.

    •    Check your calendar or appointment views to see if “Conversations AI” sources are being tagged correctly.

    •    Continue optimizing your bots by pairing logs with Workflow reporting and contact automation.
