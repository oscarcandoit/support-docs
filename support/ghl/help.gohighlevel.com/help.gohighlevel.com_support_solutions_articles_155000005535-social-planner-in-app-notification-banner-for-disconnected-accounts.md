# **What are In-App Notification Banners for Disconnected Accounts?**

The Social Planner In-App Notification Banner is a real-time alert system within HighLevel that notifies users when any of their connected social media accounts become disconnected. These banners appear directly inside the Social Planner, Launchpad, and Dashboard, providing immediate visibility and prompting users to take action to restore connections and prevent disruptions to scheduled content.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the In-App Notification Banners for Disconnected Accounts**

The notification banner system offers several advantages for users managing multiple social accounts:

- **Instant Awareness:** Receive immediate alerts when a social account disconnects, reducing the risk of missed or failed posts.

- **Multi-Channel Alerts:** Get notified both via in-app banners and email, ensuring you never miss a critical update.

- **Platform-Specific Messaging:** See clear, tailored messages for each platform (Facebook, Instagram, Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube) for easy identification and action.

- **Seamless Workflow:** Quickly reconnect accounts without leaving your workflow, minimizing downtime.

- **Improved Account Health:** Proactively manage account connections to maintain a consistent posting schedule and avoid content gaps.

* * *

## **How to Find and Act on Disconnected Account Alerts**

Tracking and responding to in-app notification banners is straightforward, ensuring you can act quickly to restore any disconnected accounts and keep your social content on track.

### **Step 1:** Connect Your Social Accounts

### **Step 2:** Monitor for Notification Banners

- Each banner provides a **platform-specific message**, such as:




  - “The connection for the following Social Planner Facebook page(s) has expired: \[Account Name\].”

  - “The connection for the following Social Planner Instagram account(s) has expired: \[Account Name\].”

### **Step 3:** Take Action to Reconnect
