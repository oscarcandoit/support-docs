# **What is Ad Manager?**

Ad Manager is a HighLevel feature that allows agencies to **offer and manage ad services** for their clients (sub-accounts) directly within the platform.

It provides a centralized experience where agencies can:

- Create, monitor and optimize ad campaigns for clients.

- Set their own pricing and resell the service to sub-accounts.

- Simplify campaign management across platforms like **Meta,** **Google and LinkedIn Ads**.


Unlike native Ad Manager platforms, this tool is designed for agencies to **package and monetize ad services** efficiently inside HighLevel.

```
Note: Ad Manager is a SaaS feature that gives you the tools to resell and manage ad services. It doesn't include ad copywriting or creative design. those remain part of the services your agency can choose to offer alongside the tool.
```

* * *

## **Pre-requisites**

Before setting up Ad Manager for your clients, make sure:

- Your **Agency Stripe Account** is connected.

  - This is required to collect monthly subscription payments from your clients.

  - Learn [How To Connect Stripe To Your Agency Dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

Once Stripe is connected, you can manage resale pricing and subscriptions through the **Reselling tab** in your Agency Settings.

* * *

## **How to enable Ad Manager for your sub-accounts using SaaS configurator**

1. If you offer SaaS services, go to **Agency view > SaaS Configurator**.

2. Select your active SaaS plans and click **Edit Details**.

3. Open the **Addons** **Tab** and ensure **Ad Manager** tile is checked.

4. Click **Save** to apply changes.

**Note:** All agencies have access to Ad Manager at no cost. “You Pay” is fixed at $0.

* * *

## **Setting up Reselling for Ad Manager**

You can choose to offer Ad Manager to your sub-accounts for free or resell it at your own price.

### **At the Agency Level**

1. Go to **Agency view > Reselling tab**.

2. Locate the **Ad Manager** section/card.

3. Choose your resale preference using the thumbs icons:

   - ? Yes : You plan to resell Ad Manager.

   - ? No : You don’t plan to resell.
4. In the **Your Price** field, enter the resale price you’d like your sub-accounts to pay.

   - Default value is **$0** (free for sub-accounts).
5. Click **Save**.

This price will automatically apply to all sub-accounts unless you customize it at the sub-account level.

* * *

## **Personalizing offers for certain clients/sub-accounts**

You can personalize Ad Manager pricing for specific clients to match their plan or package.

1. Go to **Agency view > Sub-Accounts**.

2. Select the client (sub-account) you want to customize.

3. Click **Manage Client > Reselling Tab**.



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055980026/original/NkI94A95EP0xg-Jsl7nxDVOoy3nv3SPJdw.png?1760454419)

4. Scroll to the **Ad Manager** section.

5. Set a custom **Your Customers Pay** amount for this client.

6. Save your changes.


**Note:**

- If the client already has Ad Manager active, pricing changes will apply to new subscriptions only — existing subscriptions remain on their current rate.
- Once price is set and customer subscribes to that price, the reselling amount cannot be changed unless subscription is canceled and customer resubscribed with the new price.

* * *

## **Offering Ad Manager for Free**

If you wish to include Ad Manager as a free add-on for some clients:

1. Go to **Agency view > Sub-Accounts**.

2. Select the client you want to offer Ad Manager to.

3. Click **Manage Client > Reselling Tab**.



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055981229/original/aFCRivQJgQ3iIw_jv_KoGeM1KH-DYobADA.png?1760455075)

4. Under **Ad Manager**, check the checkbox for **Deploy Ad Manager Directly** which automatically sets **Your Customers Pay = $0**.



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055981745/original/4ckpmK8yNdNgKNyj5451bWWl6JpYEozoeQ.png?1760455383)

5. Click **Save**.


That sub-account will have instant access to Ad Manager without a paywall.

* * *

## **Disabling Ad Manager for certain clients**

To remove or prevent Ad Manager access for a specific sub-account:

1. Go to **Agency View > Sub-Accounts**.

2. Open **Manage Client > Reselling Tab**.

3. Under **Ad Manager**, toggle **OFF**.

4. Click **Save**.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055982306/original/V9gNvQLa07v3FJ0sdJ9eEAgokc532onLog.png?1760455613)

**Note:** Once a client has purchased or activated Ad Manager, the feature cannot be disabled retroactively for that account.

* * *

## **How Clients Discover and Purchase Ad Manager**

Your clients can find and activate Ad Manager from their account directly:

1. Log in to their sub-account.

2. Go to **Marketing > Ad Manager** from the left menu.

3. Depending on your resale configuration, they’ll see one of the following CTAs:

   - **“Activate Ad Manager for $X/month”**: if resale price > $0.



     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055982902/original/UUHlWmnhE-mv0FYweGOECUTV6Hpj6PorVg.png?1760455887)

   - **“Get Started”**: if resale price = $0. This is directly the one time onboarding screen which customers will see.



     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055983124/original/Ax8xp0PSFoc-6Fw3dQEaob9ujuVtQeER_A.png?1760456059)

When a client activates Ad Manager:

- A subscription is automatically created between their payment method and your agency’s Stripe account.

- The client is then guided through the Ad Manager onboarding flow.


* * *

## **Understanding Billing and Subscriptions**

### **For Agencies**

- Agencies no longer pay HighLevel for Ad Manager — the **agency cost is $0**.

- Agencies can freely define resale pricing for sub-accounts.

- Existing agencies with sub-accounts already using Ad Manager under **Utility** or **Founder’s plans** will continue to see those plan cards — **no cancellations or billing changes** have been made.



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055983592/original/9y_GH7kv2sBx1b9Z7yY40CSkIgM8jB48kQ.png?1760456233)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055983957/original/kTCvG1HbZD7YkmdvmW8bAQnAidmtdMtpTQ.png?1760456361)


### **For Sub-Accounts**

- Sub-accounts paying agencies for Ad Manager will continue at their current rate.

- New sub-accounts will follow the agency’s resale price setup (either $0 or custom).


To view billing details:

1. Go to **Agency Settings > Billing**.

2. Locate the **Ad Manager** card.

3. See what each sub-account is currently paying under your resale setup.


* * *

## **Final Notes:**

- Ad Manager is **always free for agencies** — “You Pay = $0.”

- Agencies can **monetize through reselling** at their chosen rate.

- **Existing subscriptions remain untouched** — continuity and stability are maintained.

- Use the ? / ? icons to share whether your agency plans to resell Ad Manager.
