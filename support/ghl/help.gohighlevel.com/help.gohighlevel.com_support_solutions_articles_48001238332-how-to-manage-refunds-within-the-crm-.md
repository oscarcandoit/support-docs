```

### **What are some beneficial usage cases?**

The refund processing feature can be beneficial in various usage cases:

- **Resolving customer disputes:** In cases where customers are unsatisfied with a product or service, the feature allows businesses to quickly and efficiently process refunds, improving customer satisfaction and trust in the brand.
- **Addressing billing errors:** If a customer has been charged incorrectly or multiple times, businesses can use this feature to issue a refund promptly, ensuring a smooth customer experience and reducing the potential for negative feedback.

#### **Usage cases for Partial Refunds:**

The partial refund feature can be valuable in various usage cases:

- **Adjusting for pricing errors:** If a customer was charged the wrong price for a product or service, businesses could use the partial refund feature to return the difference between the incorrect and correct price, ensuring the customer is fairly charged.
- **Offering post-purchase discounts:** Businesses may apply a particular discount or promotion to a customer's purchase after processing the transaction. A partial refund can be issued to provide the customer with the intended savings.
- **Resolving disputes with a compromise:** In cases where a customer is not entirely satisfied with a product or service, but the business and customer agree on a fair compromise, a partial refund can be issued to reflect the agreed-upon resolution.
- **Handling partial returns:** When a customer returns only part of an order, businesses can use the partial refund feature to refund the value of the returned items without affecting the remaining portion of the order.
- **Compensating for damaged or missing items:** If a customer receives an order with damaged or lost items, businesses can issue a partial refund to compensate for the inconvenience and value of the affected items.
- **Reimbursement for shipping costs:** In cases where a customer has experienced shipping issues or delays, businesses may issue a partial refund to cover the shipping costs as a gesture of goodwill.

## **FAQs**

### **Where will the refunded transactions be recorded?**

All the successful/failed attempts to process refunds will be placed under the Transaction details page. This will help keep track of the refunded amounts within a specific transaction.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294485832/original/Eshvntif-pCDHApfWzfMx2ZmnriKZ2I4Qw.png?1682492675)

### **I am not able to process refunds with Authorize.net; it gives the error "The referenced transaction does not meet the criteria for issuing a credit"**

This is happening probably because the refund does not meet the critRefundith the payment provider. Authorize.net would only allow refunding transactions after 24 hours from the transaction time. The ability to process refunds for older transactions depends on the policies of the payment provider and any specific time limitations they may have. Please refer to your payment provider's guidelines or contact their support team to clarify refunding older transactions.

### **Can I process multiple partial refunds for a single transaction?**

Yes, you can process multiple partial refunds for a single transaction if the cumulative refund amount does not exceed the original transaction amount.

### **Are Google Pay and Apple Pay transactions supported for processing refunds?**

Yes, Google Pay and Apple Pay transactions and card payments can be refunded from the platform. This will refund the amount with the bank account associated with the corresponding bank account associated with Card or Google/Apple account.

### **How long does it take for a refund to be reflected in a customer's account?**

The time it takes for a refund to appear in a customer's account can vary depending on the payment provider and the customer's bank. Generally, the refund may take four to six businRefundys to be reflected in the customer's account.

### **Is there a limit to the number of refunds I can process daily?**

A5: There is typically no fixed limit to the number of refunds you can process daily. However, it's essential to check with your payment provider to confirm if they have any specific limitations or requirements for processing refunds.

### **Are there specific user permissions for processing refunds? I don't want to allow some of my business users to process refunds.**

As of now, user permissions are not enabled for processing refunds. The best way to identify any refunds made within a transaction is to look at the transaction details. We have user-specific permissions on our to-do list. Businesses can filter any refunded transactions using the direct filter on the Transactions table.
