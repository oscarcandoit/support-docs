## **Statistics Hierarchy**

LinkedIn data in HighLevel mirrors LinkedIn’s own campaign structure. The hierarchy is:

- **Campaign Group** : Equivalent to Meta Campaigns / Google Campaigns.

- **Campaign** : Equivalent to Meta Ad Sets / Google Ad Groups.

- **Ad** : Equivalent to Meta Ads / Google Ads.


This allows you to drill down:

**Campaign Group > Campaign > Ad**

* * *

- **Average CPC** : Cost per click.

- **CPM (Cost per 1000 impressions)** : Average cost for 1000 impressions.

- **Cost per Conversion** (if applicable).


* * *

### **Performance Analytics (Trends Over Time)**

Graphs help visualize changes over time:

- **Impressions graph** : Audience reach.

- **Clicks graph** : Engagement trend.

* * *

## **Metrics by Objective**

### **Lead Generation Campaigns**

Metrics are tailored to form-based submissions:

- **Leads** : Count of completed forms.

- **CPL (Cost per Lead)** : Efficiency of lead capture.

- **Conversion Rate** : Leads ÷ Clicks (%).

- Other metrics: Status, Spend, Impressions, Clicks, CTR, CPC, CPM.


* * *

### **Website Traffic Campaigns**

Metrics are focused on website actions:

- **Conversions** : Post-click actions (e.g., sign-ups, downloads).

- **Cost per Conversion** : Spend ÷ Conversions.

- Other metrics: Status, Spend, Impressions, Clicks, CTR, CPC, CPM.


* * *

## **How to Interpret the Data**

- **Impressions vs. Clicks** : Gauge whether your ad is engaging enough.

- **CTR** : Higher % means ads are resonating with your target audience.

- **CPC & CPM** : Reflect ad cost efficiency; use to compare across campaigns.

- **Leads & CPL (Lead Gen)** : Measure lead capture efficiency.

- **Conversions & Cost per Conversion (Traffic)** : Track ROI for website campaigns.

- **Conversion Rate (Leads ÷ Clicks)** : Evaluate form quality & user intent.


* * *

## **Best Practices**

- Always check **Status** : Ads in “In Review” will not deliver until LinkedIn approves.

- Use **drilldowns** to compare campaigns within the same group or ads within a campaign.

- Customize your view : Use the **Columns** button to add/remove metrics based on what matters most.

- Export reports : Click **Export** to generate spreadsheets for deeper client reporting.

- Monitor **spend pacing** : Ensure budgets are aligned with campaign goals.

- Compare objectives : CPL for Lead Gen vs. Cost per Conversion for Traffic campaigns.
