## **What is the Embedded/Inline Voice AI Widget?**

By default, Voice AI widgets appear as **sticky or floating** buttons that stay fixed to a corner of your page.

With the inclusion of embedded placement type, you can now choose the **Embedded/Inline placement**, which allows the widget to render **inside your page content**, exactly where you want it to appear - like under a hero section, next to a CTA or within a form block.

* * *

## **Step-by-Step: Creating an Embedded Voice AI Chat Widget**

### **Step 1: Access the Chat Widget Builder**

1. From your HighLevel dashboard at the sub-account level, go to **Sites > Chat Widget**.

2. Open an existing widget or click **\+ Create New Widget** and select Voice AI as the chat widget type.

3. Once inside the builder, you’ll see four main tabs : **Style, Chat Window, Messaging and Agent**.


* * *

### **Step 2: Choose the Embedded/Inline Placement**

1. Navigate to the **Style** tab.

2. At the top, open the new **Widget Placement** section.

3. You’ll see two options:

   - **Sticky:** Floats on a page corner (default option).

   - **Embedded/Inline:** Renders inline within page content.
4. Select **Embedded/Inline**.

Once selected:

- The widget preview updates to show it as an inline element.

- The customization options simplify to show only **Avatar** and **Theme** styling.

- The **Widget Position grid** and **Contact Form toggle** are hidden automatically (since they don’t apply to embedded widgets).


* * *

### **Step 3: Customize Your Widget Appearance**

1. In the **Chat Window** tab, edit the **Button Text**, this appears below the avatar in the inline layout.

   - Example: Change “Call us here” to “Talk to our AI” or “Ask a Question.”

2. Optionally, open **Additional Options** to adjust branding elements like the business name or compliance footer.


The preview on the right updates in real time to show your embedded widget design.

* * *

### **Step 4: Generate the Embed Code**

1. Once your widget looks good, click the **Get Code** button in the top right corner.

2. A pop-up window will appear with your unique **Embed Code Snippet**.

3. Click **Copy** to save it to your clipboard.

* * *

### **Step 5: Embed the Widget on Your Website or Funnel**

You can place the widget anywhere on your site or funnel using a **Code Block** element.

#### To embed in a Funnel:

1. Go to **Sites > Funnels** and open the funnel page where you want to add the widget.

2. Click **Edit Page**.

3. On the left sidebar, search for “Code” under **Quick Add > Custom** and drag the **Code Element** onto your page.

4. Click **Open Code Editor**.

5. Paste the **Embed Code** you copied from the Chat Widget Builder.

6. Click **Save**, then **Publish** your page.

Once published, the Voice AI widget will appear **embedded inline** just like any other content block.

* * *

## **Tips & Notes**

- The embedded widget is **fully mobile-responsive,** it resizes automatically on smaller screens.

- You can have **multiple embedded widgets** on the same site or funnel, all linked to the same Voice AI agent.

- You can even use a **mix** of embedded and sticky widgets across different sections for maximum engagement.


* * *

## **Summary**

With the new **Embedded/Inline placement option**, you can:

- Add your Voice AI widget **anywhere** on your site.

- Create a **seamless, integrated** customer experience.

- Keep full control over how the Voice AI aligns with your design and content.


This setup is perfect for businesses that want the Voice AI experience to feel like a natural part of their website instead of a pop-up.
