# Managing Marketplace App Permissions: White Label Agency Control

Modified on: Thu, 19 Oct, 2023 at 4:36 AM

This article offers step-by-step instructions for white label agencies on how to manage the visibility and installation of marketplace apps for their sub-accounts. This feature allows agencies to have granular control over which apps are available to their sub-account customers.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

- [Locating the App Permissions Management:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001163#Locating-the-App-Permissions-Management%3A)
- [Approving Apps:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001163#Approving-Apps%3A)

- [Bulk Approve/Disapprove Marketplace Apps:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001163#Bulk-Approve/Disapprove-Marketplace-Apps%3A)

## **Locating the App Permissions Management:**

- Click on 'App Marketplace' on the left menu.
- Note: If 'App marketplace' is not visible on your agency account, you can enable it from the labs.
- Click on 'Manage App Permissions' located on the right top corner.
- Here, you will find apps that have a distribution type of either 'Sub-Account' or 'Agency & Subaccount'.

## **Approving Apps:**

By Default:

- All apps that are in public and live status are approved for your sub-accounts.
- This default setting also applies to new apps that pass our review process and are made public.

To Approve Disapproved Apps:

- Under 'App state', select 'Disapproved apps'.
- For bulk action, choose the apps you wish to approve and click the 'approve' button on the right top corner.

- Confirm your decision by clicking 'Approve' in the modal window.

- Once approved, the apps become visible to sub-account users under their App Marketplace. These users can then view and install them.

**For Individual Apps:**

- Navigate to the app details page by clicking on the specific app.

- Click 'approve' on the right top corner.
- Confirm the action by selecting 'Approve' in the modal.

## **Disapproving Apps:**

- Under 'App state', select 'Approved apps'.

**Effects of Disapproving:**

- The disapproved apps will no longer be visible or installable at the sub-account level.
- If these apps were previously installed, they will be uninstalled from all associated sub-accounts. This includes any supplementary features, such as custom conversation providers, workflow actions, triggers, and more.
- Disapproved apps can be approved again in the future. However, they won't be automatically reinstalled in sub-accounts where they were previously installed. They need to be manually installed again.

## **Bulk Approve/Disapprove Marketplace Apps:**

**Disabling this Option:**

- Click the settings icon on the top right corner.
