### **What Are Redirection Links?**

Redirection (dynamic) links change automatically based on whether the countdown timer is active or expired.

- **Active Timer**: Users are sent to the live offer or event page.
- **Expired Timer**: Users are sent to a different page (like an "Offer Expired" or "Waitlist" page).

### **Why and When Use Them?**

Since it's not always intuitive that a countdown timer is clickable, it's better to use the timer link in more obvious ways—like attaching it to a button, using a clear call-to-action like "Click here," or linking it to an image.

Also it is very useful in the case where the timer is used in a builder outside GHL, in those cases a user can easily copy and use the link in different elements.

### **Where to Access Redirection Links:**

- **Countdown Timer**:

1. Go to **Marketing** -\> **Countdown Timer**.
2. Click the **Copy Link**.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043382617/original/LPN9gJCLmuC4frlJdQemnp5Ncg1tJl2lpQ.png?1742196774)
- **Email Builder**:

1. Go to **Settings** in the Email Builder.
2. Click **Copy Redirection Link**.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033163276/original/owuUR9aFwpUlo7W2K0HL6u0nbqLzu5xlNA.png?1726743398)
- **Funnels/ Websites/ Stores:** In the page that has the timer element, the redirection to expired page is already configured. It is essentially working like a minute timer where the timer would not restart on every refresh and would redirect to the expiry page URL when the timer expires.

### **How to Create a Timer with Redirection:**

1. **Marketing** -\> **Countdown Timer**.
2. Set the **Active Link** (where users go before the timer expires).
3. Set the **Expired Link** (where users go after the timer expires).![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033163101/original/QPOtIcIZR3uacsy0nBQ0stmU0L0xvek0gg.png?1726743308)
4. Save the timer after selecting the timer properties like when would the timer expire.

Now your timer will automatically send users to the correct link, whether the offer is active or expired.

**FAQs**

**1\. When can we copy redirection link?**

After specifying the active and expired links, a user can copy the redirection link of the timer.

2\. **Would copy link work for all timer?**

For the Dynamic timer, copy like is not available to use it across platform. To use it in our builder, user can copy the link while adding them in an email.
