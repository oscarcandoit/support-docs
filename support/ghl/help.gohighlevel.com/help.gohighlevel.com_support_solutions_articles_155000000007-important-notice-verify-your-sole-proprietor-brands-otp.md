# Important Notice: Verify Your Sole Proprietor Brands OTP

Modified on: Tue, 11 Jul, 2023 at 11:10 PM

## Introduction:

We want to ensure you're aware of an important update regarding your existing Sole Proprietor Brands. If you have one or more Sole Proprietor Brands created before October 4, 2022, and have not completed **One Time Password (OTP) verification**, please read on for the necessary steps to avoid any disruptions.

## What You Need to Know:

To maintain your registered legacy Sole Proprietor Brands, you must confirm your identity by updating them with **a mobile phone number of the business location that is being registered** and a **Brand name** before July 5, 2023.

## Verification Process:

Once you've added a mobile phone number to your Brand, you'll receive a One Time Password (OTP) verification code **via SMS**. Within 24 hours, **reply back with 'YES'** to confirm registration and convert your Brand to Verified status. It's crucial to complete this process **before July 5, 2023, to prevent additional filtering**. After August 31, 2023, **any unverified Sole Proprietor Brands and their associated Campaigns will be removed**, and **messaging services tied to those brands will be blocked**.

## Extended Deadline:

Previously, the June 1, 2023 deadline was communicated for Brand OTP verification. However, we're extending the deadline to July 5, 2023, providing you with more time to complete OTP verification for your Sole Proprietor Brands created before October 4, 2022.

## Reason for Verification:

The U.S. telecommunications industry requires mobile number verification for Sole Proprietors to combat brand registration abuse.

## What You Need to Do:

By July 5, 2023, complete the OTP verification process for your existing Sole Proprietor Brands.

## Consequences of Inaction:

Failure to complete the OTP verification by July 5, 2023, will result in increased filtering of message traffic sent under unverified brands. After August 31, 2023, unverified existing Sole Proprietor Brands, along with their associated Campaigns, will be unregistered and removed.

In such cases, you'll need to restart the registration process for these Brands and Campaigns, incurring associated costs. The following fees apply for Sole Proprietor brands:

- One-time Sole Proprietor Brand registration fee: $4 (exempt for previously converted Starter Brands)
- One-time Campaign vetting fee: $15 (existing Campaigns exempt for now)
- Monthly Sole Proprietor Campaign fees: $2 (applicable to existing and new Campaigns)

## Conclusion:

We urge you to take prompt action and complete the OTP verification process for your Sole Proprietor Brands to avoid any disruptions or additional costs. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
