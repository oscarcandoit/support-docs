## **Best Practices for Optimal Performance**

To maximize the effectiveness of your multilingual Voice AI, keep these best practices in mind:

- **Select the Correct Language**– The Voice Agent will only process and respond in the language configured, so ensure you choose the right one during setup.

- **Avoid Language Prompts**– Do not include explicit language instructions in your prompts, as this may cause confusion. The system automatically detects and operates in the selected language.

- **Update Greeting Messages**– Customize the greeting message to match the selected language for a smooth and natural interaction with users.
