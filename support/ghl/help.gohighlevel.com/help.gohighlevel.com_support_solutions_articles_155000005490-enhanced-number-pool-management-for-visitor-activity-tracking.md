# **What is Enhanced Number Pool Management?**

Enhanced Number Pool Management refers to the new set of tools and controls for handling phone numbers within HighLevel’s visitor tracking system. These improvements allow you to move, remove, delete, and assign phone numbers between pools and the general number list, providing greater flexibility and efficiency for campaign management.

```
Note: These changes currently apply only to number pools created for visitor activity tracking (typically 4–8 numbers).

## **Key Benefits of Enhanced Number Pool Management**

Enjoy streamlined phone number management and improved campaign flexibility with these user-focused enhancements:

- Move numbers between pools without extra steps or support requests.

- Delete individual numbers from a pool while keeping the rest of the pool intact.

- Add numbers from the general list directly to any tracking pool.

## **Audit Logging**

Audit logging records every action taken within number pools, providing a transparent history for compliance and troubleshooting.

- Track who moved, removed, or deleted numbers.

- Review timestamps and details for each action.

- Use logs to resolve disputes or investigate issues.

* * *

## **Best Practices for Number Pool Organization**

Organizing your number pools effectively supports accurate visitor tracking and campaign analysis.

- Group numbers by campaign, region, or use case for clarity.

- Regularly review and clean up unused numbers to maintain efficiency.

- Use descriptive pool names for easy identification.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I restore a deleted number to a pool?**

Once a number is deleted, it cannot be restored. Only numbers removed (not deleted) can be reassigned.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many times I can move a number between pools?**

No, you can move numbers between pools as often as needed.

**Q: Will removing a number from a pool affect my tracking data?**

Removing a number only changes its pool assignment; it does not delete historical tracking data.

**Q: How do I know who made changes to a number pool?**

All actions are recorded in the audit log, including the user, action, and timestamp.

**Q: What happens if I delete a pool?**

Deleting a pool removes all numbers within it. To keep numbers, move or remove them before deleting the pool.
