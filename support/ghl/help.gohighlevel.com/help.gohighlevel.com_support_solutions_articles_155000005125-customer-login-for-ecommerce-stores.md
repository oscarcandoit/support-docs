# Customer Login for Ecommerce Stores

Modified on: Tue, 22 Apr, 2025 at 11:41 AM

## **Customer Login for Ecommerce Stores**

This article introduces the new **Customer Login** feature available in HighLevel Ecommerce Stores. With this feature, store visitors can log in directly from your storefront to access their past orders and account-specific content — all without leaving the store page. This streamlined experience builds trust, encourages repeat purchases, and adds a professional polish to your online store.

## **What is Customer Login?**

The Customer Login feature enables a dedicated login portal for your ecommerce store. When enabled, a login button appears in the store’s navigation menu. After logging in, customers gain access to a personalized dropdown menu that includes their order history and the option to log out — all built seamlessly into your store’s UI.

## **Key Benefits of Customer Login**

Customer Login adds both functionality and professionalism to your store experience. It allows customers to engage more confidently with your brand while maintaining full access to their order data.

- Seamless login directly from the storefront — no redirects needed

- Post-login dropdown provides quick access to customer-specific actions

- Customizable login icon color and navigation labels

- Toggle to open login in a new or current browser tab

- Add custom navigation menu items with redirect options

- Requires verified domain for secure login functionality


## **How to Enable Customer Login**

Follow these steps to enable and customize Customer Login for your ecommerce store:

1. **Open the Store Builder** from your dashboard.

2. Navigate to your store page and click on the **Navigation Menu**.

3. Go to:

   - **General Settings > Customer Login**

   - Turn ON the **Enable Customer Login** toggle.
4. In the same settings area, scroll to the **Menu Items Dropdown** section to:

   - Add new menu items

   - Define each item’s **redirect URL**

   - Choose whether the link should open in a **new tab** or the same window
5. Verify that your **store domain is added and verified**.

   - Make sure the domain is linked to an existing store page. Without this, the login button will not work properly.

> ⚠️ **Note**: If the toggle is OFF, the login button will not appear in your store’s navigation. A valid domain must be connected and verified for the login feature to work.

## **Login Button in Store Navigation**

The login button is a new, customizable feature in the store’s top navigation. This provides customers with immediate access to their accounts without navigating away from your storefront.

### **Login Button Features:**

- **Enable/Disable Toggle** – Show or hide the login button

- **Icon Color Customization** – Match your brand theme

- **Add More Menu Items** – Provide quick access to other useful pages

- **Open in New Tab** – Let visitors choose how they want links to open


## **Customer Dropdown Menu (Post Login)**

Once a customer logs in, their profile icon will activate a dropdown menu that contains essential actions.

### **Dropdown Options:**

- **Orders** – View a full list of past orders

- **Logout** – Sign out of the customer account


This clean, intuitive interface allows customers to stay in control of their shopping experience with minimal effort.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I disable the Customer Login toggle?**

A: The login button will not appear in your store’s navigation menu, and customers will not be able to log in.

**Q: Can I test the login feature without a domain?**

A: No. A live, verified domain must be linked to one of your store pages for the login functionality to activate.

**Q: Can I add custom links to the customer dropdown menu?**

A: Yes, you can add multiple menu items with redirect URLs and control how each opens (new tab or current tab).

**Q: Does the login sync customer data with my CRM?**

A: Currently, the login provides access to past orders and logout functionality. CRM syncing is not enabled yet.

**Q: What happens if my domain is unverified or not linked to a store page?**

A: The login button will be non-functional, and the customer login feature will not work correctly.
