## **What is the Mobile Editor?**

The Mobile Editor is a new feature in HighLevel that gives you dedicated tools to customize how your forms, surveys, and quizzes look on mobile devices. Instead of compromising between mobile and desktop, you can now style each experience independently — ensuring your content always looks polished and performs well across every screen size.

## **Key Benefits of the Mobile Editor**

Delivering a smooth, mobile-first experience is key to keeping users engaged. This feature allows you to fine-tune visual elements on mobile without affecting your desktop design.

- Upload custom **header** and **background images** just for mobile

- Independently adjust **font family**, **font size**, and **font weight**

- Style specific text elements: **Labels**, **Short Labels**, **Placeholders**

- Preview and test mobile design before publishing

- Ensure forms remain user-friendly and on-brand across devices

- Increase completion rates by enhancing the mobile user experience


## **How To Use the Mobile Editor**

Follow these steps to activate and configure your form, survey, or quiz using the Mobile Editor.

1. **Open** any form, survey, or quiz from your builder dashboard.

2. **Click the Device Toggle** at the top of the screen to switch to **Mobile View**.

3. In **Mobile View**, the right-hand panel will now offer mobile-specific settings:

   - **Layout Style**: Choose your preferred mobile layout.

   - **Mobile Header Image**: Upload an image specifically for mobile headers.

   - **Mobile Background Image**: Upload a mobile-specific background image.

   - **Font Settings**:

     - Adjust **Font Family**

     - Change **Font Size**

     - Modify **Font Weight**
4. These font settings apply individually to:

   - **Labels** (e.g., “First Name”)

   - **Short Labels** (e.g., field headers in condensed formats)

   - **Placeholder Text** (e.g., “Enter your email”)

     Once complete, **click Save**, then **Preview** to test your mobile design.

5\. When satisfied, **publish** your form — now fully mobile-optimized!

## **Mobile Header & Background Images**

Images scale differently on mobile screens. With this feature, you can upload images specifically optimized for small devices, ensuring your design looks clean and purposeful.

Why this matters:

- Mobile users interact vertically — use tighter, portrait-style images.

- Prevent image cropping or distortion that often happens when desktop images scale down.


## **Mobile Font Styling**

Text that reads well on desktop can feel cramped or oversized on a mobile screen. Use the Mobile Editor to adjust font elements individually for a smoother mobile reading experience.

Available Controls:

- **Font Family**: Choose from available system or custom fonts

- **Font Size**: Set exact px size for clarity on small screens

- **Font Weight**: Use bold, light, or normal to enhance visibility


Elements Affected:

- **Labels** — These guide users to fill fields properly

- **Short Labels** — Ideal for condensed layouts or multi-column sections

- **Placeholders** — Useful for subtle input cues


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will changes in Mobile View affect my desktop layout?**

No — all edits made in Mobile View apply **only to mobile**. Your desktop design remains untouched.

**Q: Can I use different header and background images for mobile?**

Yes! Upload mobile-specific images that better fit smaller screen ratios without affecting your desktop version.

**Q: Can I preview only the mobile version before publishing?**

Absolutely. Use the **Preview** button while in Mobile View to test what your users will see on mobile.

**Q: Are font changes global or element-specific?**

Font settings can be configured individually for **Labels**, **Short Labels**, and **Placeholders** — giving you complete control.

**Q: Do all HighLevel plans include the Mobile Editor?**

Yes, this feature is included in all plans that offer Forms, Surveys, or Quizzes.

### **Next Steps**

- Test your top forms with mobile customization to improve engagement.

- Split test mobile-optimized vs. shared designs.

- Explore more ways to enhance UX with styling options and smart fields.

- Analyze mobile-specific conversion data using analytics tools.
