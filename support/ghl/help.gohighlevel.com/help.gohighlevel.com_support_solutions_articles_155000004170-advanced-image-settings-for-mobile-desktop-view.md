# **What Are Image Dimensions Settings?**

Image dimension settings allow you to adjust image dimensions independently for mobile and desktop views. You can specify height and width for images in mobile layouts, ensuring that visuals look sharp and consistent across devices.

It also supports multiple units for measurement, including pixels (px), relative units (rem, em), and percentages (%), for greater design flexibility.

# **Why Are Image Dimension Settings Important?**

- **Enhanced Responsiveness:** Ensure images adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, improving user experience.

- **Improved SEO Performance:** Optimizing image sizes for mobile and desktop views can boost your CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) and PageSpeed scores, key factors for SEO rankings.

- **Design Flexibility:** Customize image dimensions using different units to match your specific design needs.

# **How to Use Image Dimensions Settings**

### **Step 1:** Open the Funnel or Website Builder

- Navigate to your Funnel or Website Builder in the HighLevel dashboard.

- Select the page containing the image you wish to edit.

### **Step 2:** Access Image Settings

- Click on the image to open its settings panel.

- Toggle to **Mobile View** or **Desktop View** using the preview toggle.

### **Step 3:** Adjust Image Dimensions

- In the image settings panel, locate the **Height** and **Width** fields.

- Enter the desired values for the image dimensions.

- Select your preferred unit of measurement:
  - **px** for fixed pixel dimensions.

  - **rem** or **em** for scalable dimensions relative to font size.

  - **%** for relative dimensions based on container size.

```
Note: To set different image dimensions for mobile and desktop, use the view toggle at the top of the builder to switch between views. Enter height and width values while in each specific view—changes made in mobile view apply only to mobile, and those made in desktop view apply only to desktop. This allows you to optimize image sizing separately for each device.
```

### **Step 4:** Save and Preview

- Save your changes and preview your design in both mobile and desktop views to ensure responsiveness.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I don’t set specific dimensions for mobile views?**

If you don’t specify mobile dimensions, the image will use the desktop dimensions by default, which may not be optimized for smaller screens.

**Q: How do I choose the best unit for image dimensions?**

- Use **px** for precise, fixed dimensions.

- Use **rem** or **em** for scalable designs relative to text size.

- Use **%** for dimensions that scale with the size of the image’s container.

**Q: Can I use different units for height and width?**

Yes, you can mix and match units for height and width. For example, set the height in **pixels (px)** and the width in **percentages (%)** based on your design needs.

**Q: Will this feature affect my existing images?**

No, existing images will retain their current dimensions unless you modify them. You can adjust the dimensions for individual images as needed.

**Q: Can I test CLS and PageSpeed improvements after making changes?**

Yes, tools like **Google PageSpeed Insights** and **Lighthouse** can help you measure CLS and PageSpeed scores to evaluate the impact of your optimizations.

**Q: Is this feature available for all HighLevel users?**

Yes, this feature is available across all HighLevel accounts with access to the Funnel or Website Builder.
