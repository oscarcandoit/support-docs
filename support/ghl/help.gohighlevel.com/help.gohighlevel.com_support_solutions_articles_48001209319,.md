Modified on: Wed, 20 Aug, 2025 at 8:53 AM

# **Overview**

Ever wanted to convert or import a website or funnel page into a new funnel/website you're building? With the new import feature this can now be achieved on the fly.

# **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48189609541/original/9FHdr4r9qAuPXa6Ez2WI1JEPi5IrWLWIyA.gif?1644648564)**

## **How does it work?**

**Step 2:** A pop up will appear, continue to name your page and path

**Step 3:** Click on "Create Funnel Step" to close the pop up

**Step 4:** A new modal window will appear in the funnel preview area, click on the "Import" button

**Step 5**: Select which page you would like to import and click " **import**"

### **Please Note:**

- #### In order to import or convert a funnel/website you first have to add a new step

- #### Import Funnel / Website feature imports **only a single** funnel step or a webpage

- #### You may only import an existing funnel step or website page within HighLevel

- #### Does not import from other websites/funnel providers

- #### Changes to any imported step/page will NOT affect the original step/page

- #### The import feature will NOT import the products configured or the stats accumulated on the source funnel step. Products have to be configured again after the import

- #### **\*\*** You can import a control or variation step in a funnel as well

- #### **\*\*** If you want to run split test on websites, please import that pages into funnels and run a split test there.

- Split testing is available in funnels across all plans
