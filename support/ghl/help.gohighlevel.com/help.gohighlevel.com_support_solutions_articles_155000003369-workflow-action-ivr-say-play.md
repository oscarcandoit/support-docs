## Overview

The **Say/Play** action allows you to provide instructions or information to callers via either text-to-speech or pre-recorded audio. This action is part of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, which helps guide callers through options or deliver important messages.

## Action Name

**Say/Play**

## Action Description

This action lets you configure whether to play a text-to-speech message or a pre-recorded audio message to the caller. It can be used for greetings, instructions, or any other information to be conveyed in a phone call.

## Action Details

### How to Configure

1. **Say or Play Message**: Choose whether you want to say a message (text-to-speech) or play a message (pre-recorded audio).

   - **Say a message**: Input the text you want to convert to speech.
   - **Play a message**: Upload an audio file to be played to the caller.
2. **Text to Say**: If you selected "Say a message," type the text that the system will read aloud.

3. **Language**: Select the language in which the message should be spoken. Only English is supported for this

4. **Message Voice**: Choose whether the voice will be male or female.

5. **Number of Loops**: Set the number of times you want the message to be played. Default is 1.


## |     |     |     | | --- | --- | --- | | Field Name | Description | Mandatory | | Say or Play Message | Choose between text-to-speech or playing a pre-recorded audio message | Yes | | Text to Say | The text that will be converted to speech (if text-to-speech is selected) | No (only for text-to-speech option) | | Language | The language in which the text will be spoken | Yes | | Message Voice | Select the type of voice (e.g., male or female) for the text-to-speech | Yes | | Number of Loops | Number of times the message should be repeated | No |

## Example

If you're setting up a welcome message for a customer service IVR, you might configure it like this:

- **Action Name**: Welcome Message to the Caller
- **Say or Play Message**: Say a message
- **Text to Say**: "Hello, welcome to ABC Services. Please press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support."
- **Language**: English (US)
- **Message Voice**: Woman
- **Number of Loops**: 1

## Additional Notes

- For pre-recorded audio, ensure the file is in a compatible format (e.g., MP3).
- Adjust the number of loops depending on the type of message and its importance.
