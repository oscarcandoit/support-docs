# **Migrate Contacts**

Users can export a maximum of 200,000 contact records in one go as a CSV. These will be 200,000 of the oldest records. These records (in the CSV format) will be zipped. The download link for an export will be available for 7 days.

### **Step 1:** Export Contacts

- **Prep Contact Data for Export:** Recreate mailing lists and segments into tags for migrations to HighLevel. These are your migration specific tags.

- **Export Zoho Data:** Go to Setup (![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032363599/original/cYv1R-c6bAUF_kBqEsLZktmaFdxZNFcPVg.png?1725571467)) near the top-right corner, then click Data Administration section and select Export. Click Start an Export > Module > Contacts on the Export Data page.

- **Select Fields to Export:** You can choose to export Fields from Custom View, All fields, or Choose fields to be exported. Fields should include either email or phone number to migrate to HighLevel.

- **Download Data:** Click Export. The export will be added to the Export History table with the status 'In progress'. When the status changes to Completed, hover over the entry and click the Download link (![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032363594/original/v9DwtvwftwdRvwKRvpVDQPICXrDNwjq2Fg.png?1725571466))

### **Step 2:** Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import

- **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.

- **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.

- **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.

- **Recreate Custom Fields:** Log in to HighLevel and navigate to Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields. Add custom fields to store contact data in a similar way to how they were stored in Zoho.

### **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel

- **Log in to HighLevel:** Navigate to the Contacts section using the left-hand menu.

- **Start Import Process:** Click the Import Contacts button.

- **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.

- **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.

```
Field Mapping Tip: Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding.
```

- **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as “Zoho Import.”

- **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.

### **Step 4:** Review Imported Data

- **Review:** Check that all data imported into HighLevel, including contacts and form submissions, is accurate and complete.

- **Create Smart lists:** Recreate smartlists and mailing lists based on your migration specific tags.

- **Cross-Check with Zoho Data:** Compare the data in HighLevel with the original Zoho data to ensure no discrepancies.

# **Migrate Users**

### **Step 2:** Prep CSV for HighLevel Migration

- **Check User Data:** Open the CSV as a spreadsheet and ensure all users in the CSV have unique email ids.
