# **What is Social Listening in Social Planner?**

Social Listening is a research workspace built into Social Planner that aggregates trending signals from multiple public sources. It helps you understand what people are searching, watching, pinning, and talking about—so you can turn real-time interest into timely posts and campaigns.

Social Listening centralizes trend discovery from Google, Pinterest, Wikipedia, TikTok, and YouTube and presents each source with its own metrics and context. It lives alongside your existing planning tools, so you can move directly from an insight to a scheduled post.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Social Listening**

These advantages focus on planning smarter, faster content backed by real data—not hunches.

- **First-mover advantage:** Spot rising topics before they peak to capture outsized reach.

- **Audience alignment:** Match campaigns to the exact keywords, songs, and hashtags people are engaging with.

- **Data-backed decisions:** Replace guesswork with verifiable trend metrics across sources.

- **Faster workflow:** Discover, ideate, and schedule without third-party tools or extra logins.

- **Clear client value:** Tie strategy to live cultural signals for stronger reporting conversations.


* * *

## **How To Use Social Listening**

The Social Listening tab is available wherever Social Planner is enabled in your workspace.

1. In your **Sub-Account,** Open **Social Planner** and click on the **Social Listening** tab.

2. **Step 2:** Choose the data source you want to analyze (for example, a hashtag, keyword, song, or channel). The selected source will be highlighted, and you can scroll through the full list to view detailed insights.

3. **Step 3:** Apply the **date filters** to focus on a specific time range and track trends for the dates you’ve selected.

```
Note: Clicking a trend card opens the source website in a new tab to explore the original chart or dataset with similar parameters (when supported).

For example, Wikipedia Pageviews cards open the official Pageviews tool (https://pageviews.wmcloud.org) with the article pre‑selected. Changes you make on the external site do not modify your HighLevel data.
```

## **Use Cases**

Practical scenarios that turn Social Listening insights into action. Use these patterns to move from discovery to scheduled content with minimal friction and maximum impact.

- **Weekly content planning:** Build a 7–14 day calendar by pulling 3–5 high-signal topics from multiple sources (e.g., Google + YouTube). Draft posts immediately with **Add to Planner** while momentum is high.

- **Localized campaigns:** When a source supports location, compare regions to tailor copy, visuals, and offers per market (e.g., US vs. Canada). Prioritize regions with higher search or engagement.

- **YouTube discovery → script drafting:** Use **YouTube Popular Keywords** to outline hooks and titles, then study **Trending Videos** for pacing/format cues before filming.

- **Seasonal & event content:** Combine **Pinterest growth %** (seasonality) with **Wikipedia pageview trends**(awareness) to time education posts, checklists, or buying guides.

- **Thought leadership & explainers:** Validate a rising concept via **Google Trends** \+ **Wikipedia** to publish timely explainers, FAQs, or carousel threads that meet demand.

- **Creator & competitor research:** Track **YouTube Popular Channels** to map collaboration prospects and identify topics you should cover or differentiate from.


* * *

## **Best Practices**

Actionable guidance to improve signal quality, speed to publish, and long‑term performance while reducing risk.

- **Triangulate trends:** Validate ideas across at least two sources before committing resources.

- **Mind the half‑life:** Trends decay quickly! Aim to draft and schedule within 24–72 hours of detection when appropriate.

- **Add context & credits:** Note the originating source in your post brief (e.g., “Source: YouTube Trending”) so teams understand why a topic was chosen.

- **Protect brand safety:** Avoid sensitive or misleading topics; cross‑check with authoritative references and review Wikipedia history for context before posting.

- **Work from repeatable templates:** Keep title/thumbnail/caption frameworks ready; use **Ask AI** from the top right corner to adapt tone for each network.

- **Measure intentionally:** Use consistent naming or a project label in post titles to group “Social Listening” content, then compare results in Social Planner analytics.
