## **Why This Playbook Matters?**

#### Winning a new HVAC customer is **5X more expensive** than keeping an existing one. Yet, many HVAC businesses focus only on getting new leads, while ignoring **repeat business, maintenance contracts, and referrals**—which are the real revenue drivers.

#### Every satisfied customer should bring in two more.  Every completed service should lead to a long-term maintenance plan.  Every happy homeowner should be your best marketing tool.

#### Yet, many HVAC pros:

- #### **Lose customers to competitors** because they fail to follow up.

- #### **Miss out on maintenance contracts** because they don’t have an automated system.

- #### **Struggle with reputation management**, which affects their ability to rank higher online and attract premium clients.


#### This playbook will **eliminate these problems and help HVAC businesses** build a system where **repeat business, referrals, and 5-star reviews** flow in automatically— **without extra work.**

* * *

## **What You'll Learn?**

- #### How to **automate customer follow-ups** to increase rebooking.

- #### How to **turn every completed HVAC job into a review & referral opportunity.**

- #### How to **set up maintenance agreements for predictable revenue.**

- #### How to **use AI to manage customer satisfaction & prevent negative feedback.**

## **Step 1: Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### Most HVAC companies **lose money** because they don’t follow up.  Fact: **65% of homeowners forget which HVAC company they hired within a year.**

#### ✅ **Problem:** You installed a new AC system, but never followed up for maintenance.  ✅ **Result:** A year later, when they need service, **they hire someone else** just because that company followed up first.  ✅ **Solution:** Automated follow-ups ensure **loyal customers and repeat service calls—without extra effort.**

### **1.1 Post-Service Follow-Up Messages**

- #### Send an **automated thank-you SMS or email** after every install or service call.

- #### Ask if their system is running well & remind them about maintenance checkups.

- #### Offer a **discount for their next seasonal tune-up** to encourage rebooking.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Hey Mike, thanks for trusting \[Your HVAC Company\] for your AC install! Everything running smoothly? Book a seasonal checkup in 6 months & get $50 off!"_

#### [How to Automate Customer Follow-Ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001165881-how-to-build-automated-appointment-follow-up-surveys-in-workflow-builder)

### **1.2 Automated Check-In Reminders**

- #### Set up **6-month & 12-month reminders** for key HVAC services:


  - #### **Spring AC Tune-Ups**

  - #### **Fall Furnace Checkups**

  - #### **Annual Duct Cleaning & Filter Replacement**
- #### Send a **quick online booking link** to make scheduling effortless.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Mike, it’s been 6 months since your last AC tune-up. Need us to stop by? Reply YES, and we’ll take care of it!"_

#### [How to Set Up Maintenance Reminders](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001167806-how-to-send-users-appointment-reminders)

* * *

## **Step 2: Get More 5-Star Reviews Automatically**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### More reviews = **higher Google rankings = more jobs.**

#### Fact: **HVAC companies with 50+ positive reviews get 270% more leads** than those with fewer reviews.

#### Yet, most HVAC businesses **struggle to get reviews consistently.**

### **2.1 Automate Review Requests**

- #### **Trigger review requests** via SMS & email **right after job completion.**

- #### Personalize messages with the **customer’s name and job details.**

- #### **Direct customers to Google, Facebook, and Yelp** to maximize visibility.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Mike, thanks for trusting us! If we did a great job, could you leave us a quick review? It helps us a ton! Click here: \[Google Review Link\]"_

#### [How to Send Automated Review Requests](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003873-how-to-setup-workflow-triggers-for-google-and-facebook-reviews)

### **2.2 Handle Negative Reviews Proactively**

- #### AI **flags negative reviews** before they go public.

- #### Customers with complaints get an **instant response & follow-up call** to resolve issues.

- #### Turn **unhappy customers into loyal clients** by addressing concerns **before they escalate.**


* * *

## **Step 3: Create a Referral Machine**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### ✅ Referral customers convert **5X faster.**  ✅ They **spend 16% more** than cold leads **.**  ✅ They **trust your brand** before even calling you.

### **3.1 Set Up a Referral Program**

- #### Offer a **discount or service credit** for every referral.

- #### Give incentives to **both the referrer & the new customer** (Example: $50 off their next service).


#### **Example Message:**  _"Love working with us? Refer a friend & you BOTH get $50 off your next HVAC service! Just send them this link: \[Referral Link\]"_

#### [How to Set Up an Automated Referral Program](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001213448-affiliate-refferal-page-leads-customers-cancelled-statuses)

### **3.2 Automate Referral Follow-Ups**

- #### Send a **personalized follow-up message** after every job.

- #### HighLevel **tracks referral leads & applies rewards automatically.**


#### **Example Message:**  _"Mike, do you know someone who needs HVAC service? Send them our way & we’ll give you BOTH $50 off!"_

* * *

## **Step 4: Lock in Recurring Revenue with Maintenance Plans**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### ✅ **HVAC companies with maintenance agreements generate 30% more revenue.**  ✅ **Customers with service plans are 5X more likely to use the same provider.**

### **4.1 Offer Service Plans for Recurring Work**

- #### Create **seasonal or annual maintenance plans** for HVAC tune-ups.

- #### **Automate invoicing & renewal reminders** so customers stay enrolled.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Join our VIP HVAC Maintenance Plan: 2 annual tune-ups + priority service = $199/year. Save $$ & keep your system running efficiently!"_

#### [How to Set Up Subscription-Based Services](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004138-pause-and-resume-subscriptions)

* * *

## **Step 5: Use AI & Smart Lists to Boost Customer Engagement**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### Your past customers are **10X more likely to book another job** than a cold lead.

### **5.1 Smart Lists for Re-Engagement**

- #### Create lists of past customers by:


  - #### Service type

  - #### Location

  - #### Seasonal needs
- #### **Send reminders, upgrade offers, and special promotions.**


### **5.2 AI-Powered Follow-Ups & Surveys**

- #### Use AI to **check in with past customers via SMS.**

- #### Send satisfaction surveys to gather feedback & prevent churn.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Hey Mike, it’s been a year since your last furnace check-up. Need an inspection? Reply YES to book!"_
