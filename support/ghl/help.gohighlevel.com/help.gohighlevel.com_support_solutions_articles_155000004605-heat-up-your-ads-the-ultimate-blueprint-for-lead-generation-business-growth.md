## **Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads**

## **Why It Matters?**

#### When homeowners need HVAC repairs, **they Google it first.**

- #### **70% of HVAC customers hire a provider who appears in the first five search results.**

- #### **Google Local Services Ads (LSA) deliver leads, not clicks**, making them the most cost-effective way to advertise.

- #### **The average cost per lead (CPL) for HVAC businesses on Google Ads is $30 - $100**, but can be lower with proper targeting.


### **1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

#### ✅ Appear at the top of search results for **“HVAC repair near me”** or **“AC installation services.”**  ✅ Pay **only for valid leads**—not just clicks.  ✅ Get **Google Guaranteed certification** (increases lead conversion rates by **30%**).  ✅ Target high-intent service categories:

- #### **AC Repair** (Spring & Summer)

- #### **Heating Repair & Furnace Services** (Fall & Winter)

- #### **HVAC Tune-Ups & Maintenance Plans** (Year-round)


#### **Example:**  An HVAC company running LSAs for **“Emergency AC Repair 24/7”** sees **higher-intent leads** and **40%+ close rates.**

#### [How to Set Up Google Local Services Ads](https://support.google.com/localservices/answer/6224841?hl=en&co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS)

### **1.2 Run High-Intent Google Search Ads (PPC Ads)**

- #### **Bid on job-ready keywords:**


  - #### “AC installation near me”

  - #### “Furnace repair available now”

  - #### “Best HVAC contractor in \[City\]”
- #### **Use call tracking** to measure ad success.

- #### **Optimize landing pages** with clear CTAs like "Schedule a Free Estimate Today!"


#### **Budget Tip:**  Start with **$50/day**, focusing on **seasonal emergency services** for the highest ROI.

#### [How to Set Up PPC Campaigns for HVAC](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001220947-how-to-set-up-google-ad-conversion-actions)

### **1.3 Enable Call Tracking on Google Business Profile**

#### ✅ Use a **call tracking number** to monitor which ads generate calls.  ✅ Track **every missed call and message** from ads.  ✅ Automate **SMS follow-ups for missed calls** to recover up to **30% of lost leads.**

#### **Example:**  If **50% of calls go unanswered**, setting up a **missed-call text automation** can **recover 20%+ of lost jobs.**

## **Step 2: Run Facebook & Instagram Ads to Target Local Customers**

## **Why It Matters?**

#### Many homeowners **don’t search for HVAC services until they need one.** But **when they do, you want to be the first company they think of.**

- #### **Facebook & Instagram ads build brand awareness**, keeping your business top-of-mind.

- #### **HVAC ads on Facebook can generate leads for as low as $5 - $15 per lead.**

- #### **Cost-per-click (CPC) on Facebook is lower than Google Ads**, making it a great low-cost strategy to attract homeowners.


#### [Overview about the Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002433-overview-of-ad-manager)

#### [Connect Facebook with Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003044-connect-facebook-with-ad-manager)

### **2.1 Create High-Converting Facebook Ads**

#### ✅ Use **before-and-after system installations** to showcase expertise.  ✅ Feature **customer testimonials & 5-star reviews** to build trust.  ✅ Target **homeowners, real estate investors, & property managers.**

#### **Ad Targeting:**

- #### **Location:** Zip codes within your service radius.

- #### **Interests:** Home improvement, smart home tech, energy efficiency.

- #### **Demographics:** Homeowners aged **30-65+**.


#### **Example Ad:**

- #### **Offer:** "$100 Off Your Next HVAC Installation!"

- #### **Ad Copy:** "Thinking about replacing your HVAC system? We offer energy-efficient solutions—book a free estimate today!"

#### ✅ Show ads to people who **visited your website but didn’t book.**  ✅ Retarget **past customers for seasonal HVAC tune-ups.**  ✅ Offer **discounts or limited-time deals** to create urgency.

#### **Example Ad:**  _"You checked out our services but haven’t booked—get 10% off if you schedule today!"_

- #### **Automating lead responses increases conversions by 40%.**


### **3.1 Use a Chat Widget to Capture Website Visitors**

#### ✅ Install **Live Chat & SMS Chat** on your website.  ✅ AI chatbot **answers common questions & captures leads.**  ✅ Send **instant follow-ups** via text or email.
