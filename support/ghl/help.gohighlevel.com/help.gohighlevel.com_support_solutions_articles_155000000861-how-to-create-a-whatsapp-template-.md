## **Template Category Validation in WhatsApp Manager**

When you create a new template in **WhatsApp Manager**, you must select a **category** for it (e.g., Marketing, Utility, or Authentication).

Meta will then validate your chosen category against its official **template category guidelines**. Based on the validation outcome, the system will assign a status to your template—such as **Approved**, **Pending**, or **Rejected**.

It’s important to ensure your message content matches the selected category to avoid delays or rejections during the approval process

* * *

## **Pre-Requisites and Guide to Setting Up WhatsApp at a Location**

To start using WhatsApp effectively at any location, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The sub-account (location) must have an **active WhatsApp subscription**.

- **Meta onboarding** must be completed successfully.

**Need help onboarding?** Refer to the [WhatsApp Location Onboarding Steps and Best Practices](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005793-how-to-use-the-whatsapp-business-onboarding-checklist) to complete the process.

## **How to Create a WhatsApp Template**

WhatsApp templates are required to initiate outbound messages. You can customize and categorize these templates for different use cases.

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Template Settings

From your Sub-Account, navigate to **Settings → WhatsApp → Template** tab. Then Click **\+ Create Template**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017326688/original/3H_BBOwlmRL_OdL4I2_Dtv_UYRiV6czLkA.png?1704897872)

```
WhatsApp's latest update introduces support for Media Templates, enabling users to send various types of media content, including Images, Videos Documents, and Location. Learn more here: WhatsApp Media Templates
```

#### **Step 2:** Fill In Template Details

You’ll need to provide the following:

- **Template Name** – Use only lowercase characters and no spaces.



**Category** – Choose between:




  - _Marketing_ – For promotional content.

  - _Utility_ – For transactional or service-related messages.

  - [Click here to see Meta’s Template Categorization Guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing/new-template-guidelines/)
- **Language** – Select the language in which the message will be sent.

- **Header** _(Optional)_ – Can be static or include 1 custom variable (e.g. {{1}}).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017327197/original/wPwzZofX_Du-GCgeNeG9tSBCYGoXYISMyg.png?1704898013)

#### **Step 3:** Add Body and Footer

- **Body** – The core message. Use Add Variable to insert placeholders like {{1}}, {{2}} etc.

- **Footer**_(Optional)_ – A static message at the bottom of your template.

```
Note: You must fill in sample values for each variable, as required by Meta for review and approval.
```

Details around the fields available:

1. **Body** \- The message that would be sent to the customer. You can add multiple custom variables while creating the template by clicking on Add Variable.

2. **Footer (Optional)** \- You can add a static footer.

```
Note: Please fill sample value for all the custom variables added as Meta need examples to be sent while submitting the Template.

#### **Step 4:** Review & Submit

Once the template is filled in, review it and click **Create**. The system will automatically submit the template to Meta for approval.

2. Click on the tag icon and choose a system field like contact name, phone, etc.
3. Provide a sample value for each variable (e.g., {{1}} → “Shubham Gupta”). Meta uses these samples during template approval.

**Q: What are the different WhatsApp Template categories, and how do I choose one?**

Meta provides three categories:

- **Marketing**: For promotions, offers, announcements, etc.
- **Utility**: For transactional messages such as order updates or appointment reminders.
- **Authentication**: For OTPs or secure login purposes.

Choose a category that closely matches the intent of your message to avoid rejections.

**Q: How can I edit or resubmit a rejected WhatsApp template?**

1. Navigate to **Settings → WhatsApp → Templates**
2. Click the accordion (expand) icon next to the rejected template
3. Hit **Edit Template**, make necessary changes, and click **Create** to resubmit for approval.

**Q: What do the WhatsApp Template statuses mean?**

- **Pending**: Submitted to Meta, waiting for approval
- **Approved**: Validated and ready to use

**Q: Can I use media like images or videos in WhatsApp templates?**

Yes. With Media Templates, you can include:

    •    **Images**

    •    **Documents**

You can choose from:

- **Quick Reply**
- **Visit Website**
- ****Personalized Website Link****

- ****Copy Offer Code****
- **M** **arketing Opt-Out**

Each serves a unique purpose and enhances user interaction with your brand.

This allows you to track engagement and set automation rules based on clicks.

Make sure your number is fully onboarded and your template categories are compliant before launching.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017331500/original/EN6XqFdAU65X5f72ywHF9Qs1Bu19vXfRvQ.png?1704899501)

**Step 2** \- Click on tag icon and select the custom variable(as in this case it is contact name) and a sample text(Shubham Gupta in this case).![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017331822/original/WebxbNpvOEd5TZOr73fmyLpVq0ZE9LUrkg.png?1704899602)

**Q: How do you submit a rejected template or edit a previously approved template?**

****Step 1** -** Click on the accordion icon and hit Edit template **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017332808/original/GZbb96HyQuSNgErD-D4n1_qy2kihwUnK6w.png?1704899840)**

****Step 2** \- Fill in all the information again and hit Create.**

**Q: Why the “Create” Button May Be Inactive for WhatsApp Messages in GHL**

If the “Create” button for WhatsApp messages is inactive (grayed out or unclickable) in your GoHighLevel account, here are the most likely reasons:

1\. WhatsApp Template Approval Pending: If you’re trying to send a template message, the template must be:

- 1.Approved by Meta
- 2.Available under the active WhatsApp number

Fix: Go to Settings > WhatsApp > Templates and check the approval status. Only approved templates will allow message creation.

2\. No Valid WhatsApp Number Connected: Ensure you have a WhatsApp number connected successfully via:

- 1.API (New WABA setup), or
- 2.Coexistence (existing WhatsApp Business App)

Fix: Go to Settings > WhatsApp and confirm that the phone number shows as “Connected” and “Approved.”

3\. Missing Required Fields or Variables: If you’re using a message template with dynamic variables (e.g., {{1}}, {{2}}) and haven’t filled all fields correctly, the button will stay inactive.

Fix: Double-check that all variables have valid placeholder text and inputs.

4\. Message Type Not Supported for WhatsApp: Ensure you’re not using media or message types that are unsupported by WhatsApp (e.g. unsupported buttons).

Fix: Use only approved formats such as:

- Text
- Media (image/video)
- Quick replies
- CTA buttons
