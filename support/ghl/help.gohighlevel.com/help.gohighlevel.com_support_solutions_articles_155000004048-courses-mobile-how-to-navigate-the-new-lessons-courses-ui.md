## **1\. Seamless Category and Lesson Navigation**

Switch effortlessly between categories and lessons on the same screen without needing to go back and forth. Here’s how it works:

- **Expand**: Dive deeper into a category or lesson to explore content in detail.
- **Collapse**: Get a quick overview when you want to focus on essentials.

This makes navigating between lessons and categories easier and more efficient.

## **2\. Effortless Learning for All Lesson Types**

No matter what type of lesson you’re engaging with—text, audio, or video—the new interface simplifies the learning experience:

- **Text Lessons**: Easily readable on any screen size.
- **Audio Lessons**: Smooth playback and intuitive controls.
- **Video Lessons**: Full-screen viewing and responsive design for uninterrupted learning.


## **3\. All-New Comments Section**

Engage with your peers in a newly redesigned comments section:

- **Reply Directly**: You can easily respond to individual comments to keep conversations flowing.
- **Better Interaction**: Enhanced layout ensures smoother conversations with improved readability and interaction.


## **4\. Sleek Quizzes & Assignments Interface**

Say goodbye to cropped content and confusing transitions. Now you can:

- **Switch between questions seamlessly** without losing focus.
- **Assignments** and quizzes are clearer and easier to navigate, ensuring a more streamlined experience.


## **5\. Quick Status Overview**

Stay on top of your progress with our new status tracker:

- **At a Glance**: Quickly find out if your quizzes and assignments are in review, passed, or need improvement.
- **Color-Coded for Clarity**: Easily see the status of each task for better management.


## **6\. Shimmers, Not Loaders**

We’ve replaced the old-school loading spinners with sleek shimmering placeholders:

- **Modern Look**: No more waiting on boring spinners—now your content loads with style.
- **Smooth Loading**: Enjoy a visually smooth experience while waiting for lessons, quizzes, or assignments to load.


## **7\. Code Structure & Performance Enhancements**

For improved performance and maintainability, we’ve made backend updates, including:

- **Improved Code Structure**: Updated to Vue 3 composition API for better code readability and structure.
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: We’ve split large pages into smaller components, lazy-loaded them, and reduced the initial load time for the app.

### **How to Get Started**

- **Update your app** to the latest version to experience these exciting new features.
- Navigate through your courses, try out the new comments section, and check the status of your quizzes and assignments.
