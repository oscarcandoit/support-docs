## **What is the Voice-AI Translation Service?**

HighLevel’s Voice AI Translation Service automatically renders every AI‑generated call transcript and call summary into a target language you select. By pairing powerful speech recognition with machine translation, it delivers written insights you can read and share in the language that serves your clients and teammates best.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Voice-AI Translation Service**

The translation feature improves clarity, accessibility, and inclusivity for global operations:

- **Inclusive Communication**: Everyone on your team, regardless of language proficiency, can review call details with confidence.

- **Instant Visibility**: Transcripts and summaries appear in your target language seconds after each call finishes—no copy‑paste needed.

- **Centralized Workflow**: View translated content directly in **Dashboard & Logs**, eliminating the need for external tools.

- **Client Empowerment**: Provide multilingual reporting that boosts transparency and trust with global customers.

- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual translation tasks and free up time for higher‑value follow‑ups.

## **Enabling Translation in Agent Setup**

You can activate translation with just a few clicks during agent creation. Whether accessing Translated Transcripts & Summaries
Translations live, where you already review call data, so there’s no extra navigation, or it can also be activated during agent creation or by editing an existing agent.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to **Settings → Voice AI Agents**

2. Click **Create Agent** or edit an existing agent from the **Agent List**.

3. Enable the **Translation Service** toggle.

4. Select your **preferred translation language** from the dropdown.

5. **Save** the agent.

## **Accessing Translated Transcripts and Summaries**

After a call is completed, the translated versions of transcripts and summaries become available in Dashboard and Logs. You can view the summary of the translation in the Dashboard and logs. Dashboard and logs are listed on the homepage of the Voice AI agents as well as inside the individual AI settings.
