# Local Presence Dialing in the Mobile App

Modified on: Thu, 16 Oct, 2025 at 1:31 PM

Reach more leads and boost answer rates by making every outbound call look local. Local Presence Dialing on the HighLevel mobile app automatically picks a phone number that matches (or is closest to) your contact’s area code—even internationally—so prospects are more likely to pick up.

## **What is Local Presence Dialing on Mobile?**

Local Presence Dialing dynamically selects the best outbound caller-ID for each call you place from the HighLevel mobile app. The feature searches your workspace’s purchased and verified numbers, chooses one that shares the contact’s area code (or nearest city), and presents that familiar local number on the recipient’s phone. This local identity fosters instant trust and measurably increases connection rates.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Local Presence Dialing on Mobile**

Local Presence Dialing delivers several user-focused advantages that make every call count.

- Higher answer rates—contacts are 3–4× more likely to answer a familiar local number.

- City-level precision—mobile matches the closest city first, then the state, before falling back.

- International reach—automatically uses an in-country number when you dial outside the U.S. or Canada.

- Smart fallback—if no perfect match exists, the app falls back to the user-assigned number, then the sub-account default, ensuring every call still goes out.

- Seamless experience—your default web-app setting carries over to mobile, so there’s nothing to reconfigure.

* * *

## **International Support**

Local Presence Dialing isn’t limited to North America. When you dial an overseas contact, the mobile app first looks for a number you own in that country. If one is available, it’s used automatically—giving your call a native caller-ID that builds confidence across borders.

* * *

## **Smarter Fallback Logic**

This enhancement guarantees calls always connect—even when a perfect local number isn’t available.

1. Search for an exact area-code match.

2. If none, use the number assigned to the user.

3. If still unavailable, default to the sub-account’s primary number.

These automated tiers remove guesswork and keep your outreach consistent.

* * *

## **City-Level Precision (Mobile Only)**

Unlike web, the mobile app drills down past the state level to locate the nearest city number first. For example, a call to a 415-area-code lead in San Francisco will attempt to use a 415 number; if one isn’t owned, it looks for any other California number before falling back. The result is the most geographically relevant caller-ID possible.

* * *

## **Enhanced Number Picker**

The redesigned Number Picker makes one-off overrides quick, clear, and temporary.

Accessed from the call screen, the picker lists every number you can dial from—complete with assignment tags (user, workspace, etc.) and number type (Local, Mobile, Toll-Free).

1. Choose a different number for a single call with two taps.

2. After the call ends, the system reverts to your default Local Presence Dialing setting automatically.

## **How To Set Up Local Presence Dialing**

Proper setup takes place once in the web app and instantly syncs to all mobile users.

**Step 1:** In the web, open the desired Location. Navigate to Settings → Phone Numbers → Voice → Other Settings → Outbound Call → Default Phone Number for Outbound Calls.

Select Local Presence Dialing .

**Step 2:** Update the HighLevel/LeadConnector mobile app to v4.0.0 or later.

**Step 3:**Open the app and start calling—Local Presence is active automatically.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does Local Presence Dialing cost extra?**

A: No. The feature is included with your existing phone-system plan; your only cost is purchasing additional numbers if needed.

**Q: Will it work if I bring my own Twilio account?**

A: Yes. Local Presence selects from the numbers in your linked Twilio sub-account exactly the same way.

**Q: What happens if a contact’s area code is not yet supported?**

A: The app follows the fallback logic (assigned number → sub-account default). You can request new area-code coverage through Support.

**Q: Can I disable Local Presence Dialing for a single user?**

A: The toggle is at the sub-account level. However, any user can momentarily override the caller-ID via the Number Picker for one call.

**Q: Does Local Presence work with SIM-based calling?**

A: No. SIM-based calls use your phone’s carrier number. Local Presence applies to VoIP calls placed through the HighLevel dialer.

**Q: Is caller reputation affected?**

A: Using multiple numbers spreads call volume, helping maintain healthier reputations, but you should still monitor each number for spam tagging.

**Q: Are toll-free numbers included in Local Presence selection?**

A: Toll-free numbers appear in the Number Picker but are not chosen automatically by Local Presence logic unless they match the contact’s country code.
