# **Preparation for Migration**

### **Step 1:** Review Current JotForm Setup

- **Identify Key Forms and Data:** List all active forms in JotForm, including any associated data, such as submission entries, email notifications, and integrations.

- **Document Form Workflows:** Record details of how each form interacts with your current workflows, email notifications, and any third-party integrations.

- **Assess Data Volume:** Evaluate the amount of data (e.g., form submissions, contact information) to be migrated.

### **Step 2:** Define Migration Goals

- **Set Clear Objectives:** Determine what you want to achieve by migrating to HighLevel, such as enhanced automation, better integration with CRM tools, or cost savings.

- **Prioritize Features:** Decide which forms and data are most critical to migrate first.

### **Step 3:** Prepare Backup

- **Export Data from JotForm:** Export all necessary data from JotForm, including form submissions, templates, and configurations.

- **Backup Data:** Ensure all data is securely backed up before beginning the migration process.

# **Migrate Data**

### **Step 1:** Export Data from JotForm

### **Step 2:** Import Data into HighLevel

- **Recreate Forms in HighLevel:**
  - Navigate to Sites > Formsin HighLevel.
    - Use the form builder to recreate your forms, ensuring that all fields match those from JotForm.

# **Migrate Forms and Workflows**

### **Step 1:** Review Existing JotForm Workflows

- **List Active Workflows:** Identify and document all workflows triggered by form submissions in JotForm, such as email notifications, data routing, and integrations with other tools.

- **Evaluate Workflow Complexity:** Assess the complexity of each workflow to determine how best to replicate it in HighLevel.

### **Step 2:** Recreate Workflows in HighLevel

- **Create Automation Triggers:**
  - In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.

  - Set up triggers for each form submission that replicates the logic from your JotForm workflows (e.g., sending notifications, updating contact records).
- **Rebuild Actions and Conditions:**
  - Recreate actions such as sending confirmation emails, tagging contacts, or updating CRM records.

  - Set up any necessary conditions or branching logic to mirror your existing workflows.

### **Step 3:** Test Workflows

- **Run Tests:** Before activating workflows, conduct thorough testing to ensure they function as intended.

- **Adjust Settings:** Make necessary adjustments based on test results to ensure smooth operation.

# **Migrate Integrations and Notifications**

### **Step 1:** Recreate Integrations in HighLevel

- **Identify Necessary Integrations:** Determine which third-party tools you were integrating with JotForm, such as payment gateways, email marketing tools, or CRMs.

- **Set Up Integrations in HighLevel:**
  - Use HighLevel’s built-in integrations or Zapier to connect to external applications.

  - Go to Settings > Integrations to set up necessary connections.

### **Step 2:** Recreate Email Notifications

- **Set Up Internal Notifications:**
  - In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows and set up internal notifications for when a form is submitted.
- **Configure Autoresponders:** If you were using autoresponders in JotForm, set these up in HighLevel by creating automated email sequences that trigger upon form submission.
