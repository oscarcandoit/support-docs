# What is Transactions & Orders Import?

GHL now allows businesses to bulk import their past transactions and orders using CSV files. This feature helps consolidate historical financial data into your sub-account, ensuring your dashboards and contact timelines reflect accurate revenue history.

## Key Benefits of Importing Transactions & Orders

Importing allows businesses to maintain clean, centralized financial records. Here’s what you can gain from this feature:

- Easily import historical data from previous platforms.

- Automatically impact revenue dashboards and metrics.

- Create or update customer records with import.

- Separate timestamps for data ingestion vs actual transaction time.

- Simplified preview and validation before upload.

- Built-in format guides and downloadable sample CSVs.


## How to Import Transactions

Importing transactions lets you bring in data that reflects actual payment events, without necessarily creating linked order items.

1. Navigate to **Payments > Transactions**.

2. Click the **Import** button.

3. Download the **Sample CSV** and ensure your data matches the required format.

4. Upload your file and review the **preview modal** for validation.

5. Confirm the import.

**Note:** Transactions impact revenue metrics immediately once added.

## How to Import Orders

Orders represent itemized sales and automatically generate a linked transaction entry.

1. Go to **Payments > Orders**.

2. Select **Import**, then upload a properly formatted CSV.

3. Validate your data in the preview.

4. Each order record will auto-create a transaction and impact revenue.

**Note:** Both order and transaction entries will reflect on dashboards and reporting.

## CSV File Field Formats

Understanding the required structure for import ensures your data uploads without errors.

- Field names must be **exactly** as defined.

- Customer details must be included to match or create contacts.

- Dates for execution and GHL ingestion must be properly set.


* * *

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will contacts be duplicated if they're already in GHL?**

No. GHL attempts to match contacts via email or phone before creating new records.

**Q: Can I backdate a transaction?**

Yes. You can specify the transaction execution date separately from when it’s added to GHL.

**Q: What happens if my CSV has errors?**

You’ll see a preview highlighting any validation issues before proceeding with import.

**Q: Can I import refunds or voided transactions?**

Not at this time. Only successful, completed transactions/orders are supported.

**Q: Does importing affect revenue tracking?**

Yes. Revenue and other financial dashboards update based on your imports.

### Next Steps

- Explore the Revenue Dashboard to confirm data impact.

- Review your Contact timelines for imported activity.

- Setup automated workflows that trigger on new orders or transactions.
