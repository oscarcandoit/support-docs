# **What Are Custom Unsubscribe Links?**

Custom unsubscribe links are personalized opt-out links embedded in marketing emails, allowing recipients to unsubscribe from future communications in a way that aligns with your brand. Unlike default unsubscribe links, which often redirect users to a generic confirmation page, **custom unsubscribe links give you full control** over the user experience.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Custom Unsubscribe Links**

- **Enhance User Experience:** Direct users to a branded landing page that confirms their opt-out decision.

- **Provide Subscription Preferences:** Allow users the option to opt out of specific types of emails instead of all communications.

- **Maintain Compliance:** Ensure compliance with email marketing regulations like the CAN-SPAM Act and GDPR.

- **Improve Deliverability:** Reduce spam complaints by offering a clear and easy way for recipients to unsubscribe.

```
Note: Custom unsubscribe links in HighLevel use trigger links and workflows to automatically mark contacts as "Do Not Disturb" (DND), preventing them from receiving further emails.
```

## **Creating Custom Unsubscribe Links**

Follow these steps to set up a custom unsubscribe link in HighLevel:

### **Step 1:** Create an Unsubscribe Landing Page

Design a landing page that confirms the unsubscribe action. This page should inform users that they have successfully unsubscribed and if desired, offer options to manage their subscription preferences.

1. Navigate to **Sites** and then **Funnels** from your HighLevel sub.

2. Click on **\+ New Funnel** and name it **Email Unsubscribe**.

3. Within this funnel, add a new step named " **Email Unsubscribe Page**" with a path like **/unsubscribe**.

```
Design the page content to reflect the unsubscribe confirmation message. We have added a demo page below for your reference. Check out our Funnel Styling guide (*needs to be updated) for more information.

### **Step 2:** Set Up a Trigger Link

A trigger link in HighLevel allows you to perform specific actions when a contact clicks on a particular link. In this case, clicking the unsubscribe link will update their preferences.

1. Go to **Marketing** then **Trigger** **Links** from your HighLevel sub-account.

2. Select **Links** from the dropdown and click on the **Add Link** button.

3. Add the **name** of the link.

4. Paste the **URL of the unsubscribe landing page** you created earlier into the **Link URL field**.

5. Click on **Save**.

### **Step 3:** Create a Workflow to Manage Unsubscribes

Set up a workflow that automatically updates the contact's status when they click the unsubscribe link.

1. Navigate to **Automation** from your HighLevel sub-account and select **Workflows**.

2. Click on **\+ Create Workflow** and select **\+ Start from Scratch**.

3. **Name** the workflow.

#### **Set Up the Trigger**

1. Click on **Add New Trigger** and select **Trigger Link Clicked** from events.




1. Add the **Workflow Trigger Name**.

2. Click on **Add Filter** and select **Trigger Link** from the drop-down.

3. Select your **previously saved Email Unsubscribe Trigger link** from the drop-down.

4. Click on **Save Trigger** button.

#### **Add the DND Action**

1. Click on the **+** button to add an Action.

2. Select **Enable/Disable DND** action.

3. Select **Enable DND for Specific Channels** and **Email** from the Channels drop-down.

4. **Save** and **Publish** the workflow.

### **Step 4:** Insert the Unsubscribe Link into Your Emails

1. In your **email template editor**, add text like **Unsubscribe** or **Unsubscribe from this list**.

2. **Highlight** this text and click the **link** icon.

3. Click on **Trigger Links** from the Link URL dropdown and select the saved **Unsubscribe Link**.

4. **Save** the template.

```
Note:

Emails sent via workflows do not automatically include unsubscribe links. To stay compliant, you must manually add the unsubscribe trigger link to each email template used in a workflow.

To do this, highlight text such as “Unsubscribe” or “Click here to unsubscribe” in your email template, click the link icon, and select your custom unsubscribe trigger link from the dropdown. This ensures recipients can opt out no matter where the email originates.
```
