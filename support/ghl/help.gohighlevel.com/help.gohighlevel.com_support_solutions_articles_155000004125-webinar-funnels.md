#### **Step 4: Templates**

Same template library as Live Webinars, optimized for on-demand viewing.

## Automations & Reminders

One of the most powerful features of webinar funnels is automation.

- **Pre-Built Workflow Recipe** → Each webinar funnel comes with an automation recipe for reminders and follow-ups.

- **Triggers** → Registrations (form submissions) automatically start the workflow.

- **Reminders** → Email/SMS reminders can be scheduled for Live Webinars (for example, 24 hours before, 1 hour before, 10 minutes before).

- **Follow-Ups** → Post-webinar workflows send thank-you emails, replay links, and nurture campaigns.

- **Customization** → You can edit workflows via the three-dot menu on your webinar funnel to adjust timing, personalize messages, or add extra steps.


Pro Tip: Align reminder timings with your audience’s habits (for example, B2B audiences respond better to morning reminders, while B2C may need evening prompts).

## Best Practices

### Live Webinars

- Test setup before the event

- Schedule with audience timezones in mind

- Promote early and often

- Have a backup plan for technical issues

- Encourage interaction (chat, polls, Q&A)


### On Demand Webinars

- Use high-quality recordings

- Keep videos concise (30–60 minutes)

- Structure content for self-paced learning

- Keep your media library organized

- Refresh content periodically


## Troubleshooting

### Live Webinars

- **Link not working** → Verify format & test before event

- **Timezone confusion** → Clearly display timezone on registration and confirmation pages


### On Demand Webinars

- **Upload fails** → Check format, file size, and internet connection

- **Poor video quality** → Upload high-resolution versions


### General

- **Form not capturing leads** → Test form integration with CRM

- **Template not loading** → Refresh or check connection


## Conclusion

GoHighLevel webinars let you deliver content **live or on-demand**, giving you flexibility to match your audience and strategy:

- **Live** → Real-time engagement and interaction

- **On Demand** → Evergreen, scalable, and flexible access


With built-in templates and automation workflows, you can launch webinars quickly while ensuring attendees receive **timely reminders, seamless confirmations, and personalized follow-ups** — helping you maximize engagement and conversions with minimal effort.
