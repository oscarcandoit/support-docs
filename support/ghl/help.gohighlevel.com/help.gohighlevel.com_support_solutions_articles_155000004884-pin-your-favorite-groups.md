# Pin Your Favorite Groups

Modified on: Tue, 25 Mar, 2025 at 2:45 AM

## **Overview**

To help users navigate faster and stay connected to their most important groups, GoKollab now allows you to **pin your favorite groups** for quick access. Pinned groups are displayed at the top of the dedicated group sidebar, making it easier to jump into the spaces you use most.

Whether you're in **GoKollab** or within your **Communities**, this feature ensures your top groups are just a click away.

* * *

## **Key Benefits**

- Quickly access your most-used groups

- Keep key groups visible at all times

- Simplifies navigation within both GoKollab and Communities


* * *

## **How Group Pinning Works?**

- Users can pin up to **4 groups** in both **GoKollab** and **Communities**.

- In **GoKollab**, **only pinned groups** are shown in the group sidebar.

- In **Communities**, **pinned groups appear first**, followed by the remaining groups under the sub-account.


* * *

## **How to Pin a Group?**

1. Open the **Group Switcher** (located in the top navigation bar).

2. Scroll to find the group you want to pin.

3. Hover over the group card to reveal a **pin icon** on the right.

4. Click the pin icon to pin the group.

5. The group will now appear at the **top of the sidebar** and in the **Group Switcher**.


* * *

## **How to Unpin a Group?**

1. Open the **Group Switcher**.

2. Locate the pinned group at the top.

3. Click the **unpin icon** on the right of the pinned group card.

4. The group will return to its default position in the list.


* * *

## **Notes:**

- You can pin a maximum of **4 groups** per view (GoKollab and Communities).

- This feature is purely for ease of navigation—it doesn’t affect group visibility for other members.
