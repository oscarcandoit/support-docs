## **What is Traffic Source Analytics?**

Traffic Source Analytics is a visual dashboard inside Sites → Analytics that breaks down daily traffic by marketing channels and sources. The stacked bar chart and companion tabs (Traffic Channel and Source/Medium) let you attribute results to the right campaigns, compare channels over time, and filter the entire dashboard to a specific date when needed.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Traffic Source Analytics**

- **Channel clarity**: Quickly see how much traffic comes from Paid Search, Paid Social, Organic Search, Direct, Referral, Social (organic when available), and Other (Unknown/Unmapped).

- **Faster decisions**: Identify growth, dips, or seasonal shifts at a glance with daily stacked bars and immediate tooltips.

- **Better attribution**: Validate UTMs and click IDs so paid clicks don’t get misclassified as Direct or Other.

- **Team alignment**: Use consistent colors and labels so stakeholders interpret charts the same way in reviews.

- **Focused analysis**: Click a single day to filter the dashboard and investigate anomalies with context.


* * *

## **How channels are Determined in HighLevel**

- **UTM parameters**: HighLevel reads utm\_source, utm\_medium, and utm\_campaign when present.

- **Click IDs & auto-tagging**: Identifiers like gclid/msclkid/fbclid may help confirm paid traffic classification.

- **Referrer detection**: Known search engines and social networks are matched; direct means no referrer/UTMs.

- **Other (Unknown/Unmapped)**: Sessions without usable UTMs/referrers or with malformed values.


* * *

## **How To Use Traffic Source Analytics in Sites**

Proper setup ensures accurate attribution and clean visuals. Follow these steps to locate the dashboard, validate UTMs, and use drill-down effectively.

1. Go to **Sites → Analytics.**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Which metric is shown in the stacked bar chart?**

Daily visits to your Sites assets (websites/funnels) within the selected date range.

**Q: Why is some traffic categorized as Other (Unknown/Unmapped)?**

Sessions may lack UTMs, include malformed parameters, or arrive without a referrer (e.g., app browsers, redirects). Add consistent UTMs and check redirects to reduce this bucket.

**Q: What timezone does the dashboard use?**

The data aggregates by your account/location timezone. If your team is distributed, communicate the timezone to avoid confusion.
