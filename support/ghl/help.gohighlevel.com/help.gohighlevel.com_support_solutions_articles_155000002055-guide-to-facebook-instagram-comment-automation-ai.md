# **What is Facebook & Instagram Automation?**

Facebook & Instagram (FBIG) have billions of active users, but they don't provide many tools for managing contacts, customers, and conversations efficiently at scale. You want to automate some amount of these activities, so the conversations happen in FBIG, but are managed from inside your CRM, and ideally can leverage the power of AI.

HighLevel can integrate with FBIG so you get the best of both systems. All you have to do is configure several different components correctly. This guide will explain each of those components, several patterns for making them work together, and where to leverage AI.

Reply to comment via DM - This is to be selected when you want to send an outbound message based on the comment made by the customer. If you want to use multiple actions in the same workflow remember that first action will be a "Reply to comment via DM" and subsequent actions will be "Reply to DM".

## **Important points to be noted**

- In triggers "Page is" is the first field to be selected. All the other fields are dependent on it and if the "Page is" filter is deleted all the other filters will also be deleted.

- Up to 3 buttons can be added in the Interactive Messenger action.

- No further actions can be added after the "Call" button.

- After the call button the contact will directly move to the Default Branch.

- By default a wait of 1 minute is added which is editable.

- If no button is selected, contact will go to the "Default Timeout" branch.

- If Reply to DM is selected, the system will check if there is any conversation that happened within the last 24 hrs and if yes then it’ll send a message else it’ll fail to send.

- Reply to DM will be used in 2 scenarios. First one is when you want to start the conversation with the user who has send you a DM and second when you want to continue the conversation with the user after the Reply to comment via DM. For eg. when in the first action Reply to comment via DM is selected as Reply Type, subsequent actions will have Reply to DM as Reply type.

- When using Reply to comment via DM, if the contact has not replied to the First Interactive Messenger action then Interactive Messenger Action will not work in the Default Timeout Branch.

- For Reply to comment via DM a 7 day window is applicable. You need to send a reply to the comment via DM in 7 days otherwise the delivery will fail.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do I connect my Facebook Page to HighLevel?**

You can connect your Facebook Page(s) within the Social Planner. [Click here for more info on this topic.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001210327)

**Q: What happens if someone comments more than once?**

You can set your workflow to run once per contact or allow it to run every time a comment is made.

**Q: Can I delay the reply to make it seem more natural?**

Yes. You can use the **“Wait”** action before the comment reply or message action in your workflow.

**Q: What happens if someone deletes their comment after the automation triggers?**

Once the comment is submitted, the trigger fires immediately. So even if the comment is deleted later, the workflow actions will still process as intended.
