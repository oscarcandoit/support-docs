# **What Is Embedding?**

When you want to display data from outside your subaccount on your dashboard, that is embedding. If a different platform supports embedded content, you can display various elements like web pages, Google Data Studio reports, Google Docs,  slideshows, calendars, Loom videos, YouTube videos, social media posts, feeds, and more.

```
Some platforms do not allow embedding of their content, they block it.

## **Types Of Embeddable Content**

### **Youtube**

- Add an Embed element, then add the video's ID number (found after /video/ in the URL) to [https://www.youtube.com/embed/](https://www.youtube.com/embed/)

- For example if your youtube URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFTIQDCvIrc , then copy the video ID "bFTIQDCvIrc" and add it to https://www.youtube.com/embed/. So your final URL will be [https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFTIQDCvIrc](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFTIQDCvIrc)

### **TikTok videos**

- Add an Embed element, then add the video's ID number (found after /video/ in the URL) to https://www.tiktok.com/embed/

### **Instagram Posts**

- Get the sharable link for your instagram post.  You'll get a link similar to this:

[https://www.instagram.com/p/C04TE0DsEkW/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/C04TE0DsEkW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

- You'll need to replace ?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link with /embed/. The URL should look like this afterward:

[https://www.instagram.com/p/C04TE0DsEkW/embed/](https://www.instagram.com/p/C04TE0DsEkW/embed/)

- Add this final URL on your embed element configuration.
