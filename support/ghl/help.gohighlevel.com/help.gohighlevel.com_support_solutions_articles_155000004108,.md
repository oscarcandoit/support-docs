Before deploying your agent, it’s important to test its functionality. You can learn more about how your AI Agent handles specific inquiries that may arise from a conversation with a prospect or customer, and you can use that information to fine-tune your Voice AI Agent so you ultimately get a higher conversion rate!

Validate your HighLevel Voice AI agents quickly with **Two Testing methods**— **Phone Call** or **Web Call**—so you can iterate on prompts, flows, and settings with confidence. Use the phone option when you want a real telephony path, or launch a browser‑based Web Call to skip number provisioning and test instantly.

# **What are Test Calls for Voice AI Agents?**

Test Calls let you simulate real conversations with a Voice AI agent before going live. You can either receive a **Phone Call** from the agent to your phone number or start a **Web Call** directly in your browser. **Both** methods help you verify behavior, tune prompts, and confirm actions. During **Web Call** trials, **call transfer is not supported**; the session uses your **logged‑in contact** as the caller identity.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Test Calls**

Use these advantages to speed up setup, reduce friction, and improve quality before launch.

- **Faster testing:** Start a **Web Call** instantly—no phone number purchase or dialing required.

- **Realistic validation:** Use the **Phone Call** method to test end‑to‑end telephony behavior.

- **Rapid feedback loops:** Hear responses immediately, then refine prompts, knowledge, and settings.

- **High feature parity:** Exercise nearly all agent actions during trials ( **Web Call excludes call transfer**).

- **Clear caller identity:** Web Call maps the session to the **logged‑in user’s contact** for consistent context.

- **Test data hygiene:** Keep trial activity out of analytics dashboards and focus on production insights.


* * *

## **How To Setup Test Calls (Web Call & Phone Call)**

Follow these steps to launch reliable trials while ensuring your browser and telephony settings are ready.

### **Type 1 : Start a Web Call**

1. Open **AI Agents** from the left sidebar and Click on **Voice AI** in the top navigation ribbon

2. Select **Agent List** in the secondary navigation ribbon then edit the agent you would like to test

4. When prompted, **allow microphone access** in your browser.

5. Speak with your agent and observe responses and actions. _(Reminder: **call transfer is not supported** in Web Call trials.)_

6. Adjust prompts, knowledge base, or settings as needed, then repeat the trial.


### **Note:**

- **Faster Testing –** No need to **dial** or **purchase** a phone number. Simply click and start testing right away.

- **Caller identity:** Uses the **logged‑in user’s contact** automatically.

5. Click **Call me** to start the test and **answer the incoming call** on your device.

6. Review the **Call History** or **Dashboard Logs** to analyze transcripts, recordings, and summaries.

- **Receive the Call:** Answer and interact with your agent as a caller would.

- **Billing note:** Phone‑based test calls use your normal telephony setup; **standard rates may apply**.


* * *

## **Test Call History & Logs**

Understand where to review test results so you can iterate efficiently.

- **Where to find:** From the **Test Your Agent**, open **Call History** or go to **Voice AI → Dashboards & Logs** and filter by **Call Type: Test**



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053591488/original/QrB07FhEE_ZdRLEbw2OCoJsPYW2h209HAQ.png?1757605264)

- **What you’ll see:** **Duration**, **Call Status** (e.g., Completed/Missed), **Transcript**, **Recording playback**, and **Call Summary**.

- **Analytics behavior:** Test calls are **excluded** from **D** **ashboard Analytics and Performance Metrics.**


* * *

## **Reviewing Test Call History**

When you're testing your Voice AI Agent, you can go back and look at previous test calls to learn more about the conversation and how the **AI Agent** interacted with the **caller**. Use this quick reference to understand what each field means so you can diagnose issues faster and confirm whether your agent achieved the intended outcome.

To open up previous test calls, click on the dropdown titled **Call History**, and then choose the test call you want to review.
