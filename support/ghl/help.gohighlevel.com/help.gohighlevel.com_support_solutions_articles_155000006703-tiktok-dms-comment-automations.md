- Direct Messages (DMs) and post comments appear inside the Conversations Inbox in real time.

- Workflows can be triggered by those incoming messages to send interactive replies, assign leads, create tasks, or start nurture sequences.

- Every touchpoint is stored on the contact record, giving you a complete conversation history across all channels.

## **Key Benefits of TikTok DM & Comment Automations**
