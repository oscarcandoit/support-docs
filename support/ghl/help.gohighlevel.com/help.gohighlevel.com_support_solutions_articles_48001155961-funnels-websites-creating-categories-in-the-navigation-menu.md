# **What Are Categories in the Navigation Menu?**

Creating categories in your navigation menu means grouping related menu items under a single parent item, forming a drop-down menu. This allows you to structure your navigation for clarity and efficiency. In HighLevel, this is done with a simple drag-and-drop indentation method inside the Navigation Menu element.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Navigation Menu Categories**

- **Cleaner Navigation**: Declutters the main navigation bar by nesting related links

- **Improved UX**: Users can find grouped pages quickly and intuitively

- **Drag-and-Drop Simplicity**: Build drop-down menus easily with no code

- **Flexible Structure**: Rearrange or update categories by dragging items

- **Responsive-Friendly**: Menus adapt to desktop and mobile layouts


* * *

## **How to Create Categories in the Navigation Menu**

To create drop-down menus (categories), follow these steps:

1. Open your funnel or website in the builder

2. Select the **Navigation Menu** element in your layout

3. In the right-hand panel, click **Add Item → New Menu Item**

4. **Name the item** something descriptive

5. Drag and drop the new item underneath a parent item (e.g., “Home”). When it indents slightly, that means it’s nested and will appear as a drop-down

6. Click **Save** then **Preview** and hover over the parent item to see the drop-down appear


* * *

## **Previewing and Organizing Menu Items**

- Preview your navigation menu to verify structure

- Hover over any parent item (like “Home”) to confirm drop-down functionality

- Use the drag-and-drop interface to reorder or rename menu items

- You can nest multiple items under the same parent


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I create more than one level of drop-downs?**

No, To keep navigation user-friendly, especially on mobile, it is limited to one layer of nested pages.

**Q: Can menu items link to sections within the same page?**

Yes. Use anchor links to scroll to sections. For more info, see [Scroll to Elements or Sections in Websites or Funnels](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001158589).

**Q: How do I remove or rename items?**

Click on the 3 dots next to the item in the sidebar. Edit the name or click the **Delete** button to delete.

**Q: Is this process the same in funnels and websites?**

Yes, the Navigation Menu element behaves the same across both.
