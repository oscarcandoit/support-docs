# Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits

Modified on: Sun, 12 Oct, 2025 at 10:36 PM

## Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits

WhatsApp aims to create a positive and engaging experience for users while helping businesses build long-term ROI through meaningful conversations. To ensure users don’t feel overwhelmed by excessive marketing messages, WhatsApp enforces per-user marketing message template limits.

These limits restrict the number of marketing messages a person can receive from any business within a given timeframe, helping maintain healthy engagement and protecting user experience.

### What is it?

WhatsApp may limit the number of marketing template messages a person receives from any business in a given period of time, starting with a small number of conversations that are less likely to be read. Soon, we will also start to deliver fewer marketing conversations to those users who are less likely to engage with them.

### Why it’s important

WhatsApp has found that per-user marketing template limits maximize message engagement and improve the user experience, measured through improvements in user read rates and sentiment. This limit helps WhatsApp users find business messaging more valuable and feel less like they receive too many business messages.

### How this Applies to Your Business

The limit only applies to marketing template messages that would normally open a new [marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing). If a marketing conversation is already open between you and a WhatsApp user, you may send one additional marketing template message. Further marketing template messages can only be sent in an open marketing conversation if the person responds to any message.

#### **Why WhatsApp Enforces These Limits**

The goal of these limits is to:

- Prevent users from receiving too many marketing messages.

- Encourage businesses to send more relevant and personalized content.

- Improve message delivery to users who are genuinely interested in your products or services.


Since these limits were introduced, WhatsApp has observed significant improvements in both **user sentiment** and **business performance metrics**.

* * *

#### **Recent Updates to Marketing Template Limits**

WhatsApp has recently refined how these limits are determined. The updated system now takes into account several factors, including:

- The number of marketing messages a user has already received from any business.

- The user’s inbox activity.

- The user’s recent engagement levels with marketing messages.


These refinements help WhatsApp better assess if a user is open to receiving more marketing communications.

* * *

#### **What This Means for Your Business**

You may notice a **decrease in the number of marketing messages delivered**. However, this change ensures that your messages are reaching **highly engaged customers**—the ones most likely to read, interact, and convert.

Focusing on relevant and personalized marketing content will help you maximize engagement and ROI within these new parameters.

* * *

#### **Best Practices**

To make the most of these updates:

- Target active and recently engaged users.

- Regularly review message performance and engagement metrics.

- Optimize your content for relevance and timing.

- Use Utility or Authentication templates for transactional and service-related communication.


**Example:**

- The first marketing template message is delivered and opens a new [24-hour marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages#customer-service-windows) customer service window. The per-user marketing template message limit applies

- A second marketing template message can be sent in an existing conversation.

- Each time the WhatsApp user responds in an existing conversation window, you can send one additional marketing template message. You can also send unlimited [free-form](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages) messages.
