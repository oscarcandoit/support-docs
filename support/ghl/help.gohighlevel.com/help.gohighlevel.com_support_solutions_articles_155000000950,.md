**Please Note**:

```
Make sure that your Stripe account is connected/integrated on the Web app prior to accessing Tap 2 Pay on the mobile app. If you see a message saying "Stripe not connected" then that means you need to integrate it on the web app first.
```

You can integrate your Stripe account by going to **Payments** \> **Integrations** \> **Connect with Stripe**

- Ensure the location on the mobile app is configured correctly, as Tap 2 Pay only works for specific locations (Currently US only).
