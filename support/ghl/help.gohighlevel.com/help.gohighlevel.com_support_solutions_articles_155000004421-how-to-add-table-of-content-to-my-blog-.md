# How to add 'Table of content' to my blog?

Modified on: Tue, 31 Dec, 2024 at 1:53 AM

Now you can automatically generate a **Table of Contents** based on your blog's headings. It helps you structure the blog and provide the linking capability so as to help the audience easily navigate the blog.

- Enable readers to navigate your content easily with clickable links.
- Customize and style the Table of Contents to match your blog’s theme.

**? How it works?**

- Go to blog -> 'Edit blog site'.
- In the blog post editor, find a new Table of Contents icon which gives three layout options.

- Based upon the selected indentation, the 'Table of content' will be generated by hyperlinking to the concerned header.

- Adjust styles such as bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, & Font size using the toolbar settings.
