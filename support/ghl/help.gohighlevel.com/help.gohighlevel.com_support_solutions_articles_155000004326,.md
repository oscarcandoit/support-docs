## **Step 1: Set Up WhatsApp Integration**

Before you can send review requests, ensure WhatsApp is integrated into your account:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Whatsapp**.
2. **Subscribe to WhatsApp** if not already subscribed.
3. Follow the instructions to authenticate and link your WhatsApp Business number.
4. Once connected, test the integration to ensure messages can be sent successfully.

## **Step 2: Customise Your Review Request Message**

1. Go to the **WhatsApp** **Review Request** section in your dashboard.
2. Customise the message:
   - Include your business name.
   - Add a friendly call-to-action (e.g., "We'd love your feedback!").
   - Attach the review link for the desired platform (e.g., Google or Facebook).
3. Save the template for future use.

## **Step 3: Sending Review Requests**

### **Single Review Request**

1. Go to the **Reviews** section in your dashboard.
2. Click on **Send Review Request** and choose **WhatsApp** as the channel.
3. Select the customer you want to send the request to.
4. Select your customised template, review it, and click **Send**.

### **Bulk Review Requests**

1. In the **Reviews** section, upload a CSV file with customer details (name and WhatsApp number).
2. Map the fields correctly (e.g., Name → Customer Name, Phone → WhatsApp Number).
3. Select **Send Bulk Review Requests** and choose **WhatsApp** as the channel.
4. Review the preview and confirm the message.

### **WorkFlow Review Request:**

In addition to sending single or bulk review requests, you can automate the process using workflows. This method is ideal for triggering review requests based on specific events or actions.

1. **Set Up a Workflow -** Go to the **Workflows** section in your dashboard and create a new workflow or edit an existing one.
2. **Add a Trigger Event -** Define the event that should trigger the review request. For example - After completing a purchase.
3. **Add the "Send Review Request" Action**

Select **Send Review Request via WhatsApp** as an action in your workflow.
4. **Choose or Create a Template**

Pick a pre-approved WhatsApp template and personalize it with dynamic placeholders, such as `{Customer Name}` or `{Order ID}`.
5. **Activate the Workflow**

Save and activate the workflow. Review requests will now be sent automatically whenever the trigger conditions are met.

## **Best Practices for Sending WhatsApp Review Requests**

- **Personalise Messages:** Address customers by name to increase response rates.
- **Timing is Key:** Send requests soon after a positive interaction.
- **Stay Compliant:** Ensure you have customer consent before sending WhatsApp messages.
