# **Overview of Selling Gift Cards**

Selling Gift Cards is the process of offering a **prepaid balance** as a product in HighLevel. You can sell a gift card through its own checkout or by adding it to your existing selling workflows (Funnels, Forms, Stores, Websites, Payment Links, Invoices, and Calendars). This allows you to sell gift cards wherever your customers already buy!

When a customer completes a purchase, HighLevel creates a **Gift Card Order** and delivers the gift card based on the delivery option selected at checkout (immediate or scheduled). Each Gift Card includes:

- A **dedicated checkout link**

- An **embed code**

- A **QR code**

- The ability to be **added to any checkout that supports product selection**


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Selling Gift Cards**

- **Multiple Sales Channels**: Sell via a dedicated link, embed, QR code, or existing checkouts for maximum reach.

- **Gifting Built In**: "Myself or Someone Else" flows make it simple to buy for others with scheduled delivery.

- **Safe Testing & Rollout**: Separate Test and Live links help you validate pricing, denominations, and flows without affecting real balances.

- **Immediate Cash Flow:** Collect revenue before redemption occurs.

- **Brand-Aligned Design**: Upload custom artwork and choose gradients to create gift cards that match your branding.

* * *

## **Prerequisites**

Confirm these items to ensure a smooth launch process! Before you can sell gift cards, make sure you have:

- **At least one Gift Card Product is** **created and active**




  - Before selling gift cards, you must first create and activate at least one gift card. This can be done within **Payments → Gift Cards → Create Gift Card.**

  - [For a detailed overview of the process to create a gift card, click here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006980-getting-started-with-gift-cards#How-to-Create-a-Gift-Card-Product)
- **A c** **onnected payment method**




  - You must have a payment method setup in order to collect payments when selling gift cards.

  - [For a detailed overview on how to set up payments, click here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000981400)

## **Test Mode vs Live Mode**

**Test Mode** is a safe sandbox with separate checkout links and payment keys. Use it to simulate purchases, validate pricing/taxes, check inventory behavior, preview delivery messages, and test redemption. **Live Mode** is for real transactions.

Gift cards purchased in:

- **Test Mode** → redeemable only in test mode checkouts

- **Live Mode** → redeemable only in live mode checkouts

```
Tip: Send (issuing without payment) is Live mode only. Click here to learn how to send Gift Cards

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I sell the same gift card through multiple channels simultaneously?**

Yes. A gift card can be sold via its link, QR, embed, and through any existing checkout. Inventory will keep on depleting as more sales happen for the gift card.

**Q: What happens if a Gift Card Product is deactivated?**

Its Sell flow stops working — the checkout link becomes invalid, and it cannot be purchased from Stores but rest of the checkouts where it is already added continue to operate sales and the products have to be manually removed from such checkouts when the card is deactivated.

**Q: Can I sell gift card products through all payment providers?**

Yes. Gift card can be sold through any of your default checkout payment providers. However redemption on all types of products and scenarios can only be done in case of Stripe, NMI, Authorize.net and Square.

**Q: Can customers use one gift card to buy another gift card?**

No. Gift cards can’t be used to purchase more gift cards.
