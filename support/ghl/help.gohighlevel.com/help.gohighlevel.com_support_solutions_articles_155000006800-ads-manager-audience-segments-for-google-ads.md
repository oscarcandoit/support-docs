## **What are Target Interests (Affinity and In-Market Audiences)**

Target Interests are predefined Google audience categories that help reach people based on **long-term interests** (Affinity) or **immediate purchase intent** (In-Market). These are ideal for advertisers who want to expand reach beyond their own data.

### **1\. Affinity Audiences**

**What They Are:**

Affinity audiences represent users’ **lifestyles, passions, and general interests**.

Google identifies these audiences based on long-term behavior patterns, such as websites visited, videos watched, and engagement frequency.

**Examples:**

- “Tech Enthusiasts”
- “Sports Fans”
- “Health & Fitness Buffs”
- “Foodies”
- “Home Improvement Enthusiasts”

**When to Use:**

- Brand awareness or top-of-funnel campaigns.
- Building familiarity with new users likely to be interested in your product category.

**Tips:**

- Use broad audience definitions for reach.
- Exclude existing customers or Website Visitor segments to avoid redundancy.
- Combine with ad creatives focused on storytelling and brand recall.

### **2\. In-Market Audiences**

**What They Are:**

In-Market audiences identify people who are **actively researching or comparing** products and services similar to yours. These users have demonstrated **strong purchase intent** through recent searches, visits to comparison sites or product reviews.

**Examples:**

- “People searching for CRM software.”
- “Travelers looking for hotel deals.”
- “Shoppers comparing smartphones.”


**When to Use:**

- Conversion-focused or mid-funnel campaigns.
- Lead generation or retargeting during decision-making stages.

**Tips:**

- Use with **Smart** **Bidding** to optimize for conversions.
- Layer with **Customer** **Match** or **Website** **Visitor** segments for precision.
- Test smaller audience sizes first to identify best-performing niches.

## **Affinity vs. In-Market Comparison**

| **Aspect** | **Affinity Audiences** | **In-Market Audiences** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Brand awareness | Purchase intent and conversions |
| **User Intent** | Long-term interest | Immediate buying or researching |
| **Funnel Stage** | Top of funnel | Mid to bottom of funnel |
| **Example Use** | “Outdoor Enthusiasts” for a fitness brand | “People looking to buy running shoes” |

* * *

## **Combining Segments and Target Interests**

For best performance:

- Use **Affinity** or **Interest** **Segments** to attract new audiences.

- Retarget using **Website** **Visitors** or **Customer** **Match** lists.

- Scale up with **Lookalike** **Segments** and **In-Market Audiences**.

Combining both types ensures complete funnel coverage — from brand discovery to conversion.

* * *

## **Best Practices to Maximize ROI**

- Align targeting with campaign goals (e.g., Affinity for awareness, In-Market for conversions).

- Layer multiple targeting options (e.g., Customer Match + In-Market) for precision.

- Refresh audience lists regularly to maintain data accuracy.

- Exclude converted or irrelevant audiences to prevent overlap.

- Use performance reports to compare segment effectiveness.

- Always comply with Google’s audience and data usage policies.

* * *

## **Common Limitations**

- Lookalike and Interest Segments are **not supported for Search campaigns**.

- Audience creation or syncing may take up to **48 hours**.

- Minimum size thresholds apply for serving ads.

- Ensure **user consent** when uploading customer data.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to connect Google Ads before creating or using Audience Segments?**

Yes. Connect your Google Ads account in HighLevel first so segments can sync and be used in campaigns.

**Q: Which segment types can I create inline in the campaign builder?**

**Customer Match** and **Website Visitors** can be created inline. **Interest** and **Lookalike** segments are created in **Settings** and then selected during setup.

**Q: Can I combine Target Interests with Audience Segments in one campaign?**

Yes. Use the **Target Interests** tab for Affinity/In‑Market categories and the **Audience Segments** tab to apply saved segments. Combine thoughtfully to balance reach and precision.

**Q: How do Website Visitors rules work?**

Define include logic such as **URL contains** or **URL equals** to build page‑based audiences like All Visitors, Product Viewers, or Checkout Abandoners. Set a membership duration that fits your buying cycle.

**Q: Can I use segments for exclusions?**

Yes. Customer Match and Website Visitors are commonly used for exclusions (e.g., existing customers) to eliminate wasted spend.

**Q: Why don’t I see my newly created segment in the builder?**Ensure the segment is saved, the Google Ads connection is active for the sub‑account, and then refresh the Intended Audience step. New segments may take a short time to appear.

**Q: What are best practices for Customer Match uploads?**

Use clean, consented data with consistent formatting. Include stable identifiers (e.g., email) and descriptive naming so your team can reuse segments confidently.

**Q: When should I use Lookalike Segments?**

Use a well‑defined source (e.g., high‑value customers) for prospecting campaigns to scale reach while staying close to your best audience profile.
