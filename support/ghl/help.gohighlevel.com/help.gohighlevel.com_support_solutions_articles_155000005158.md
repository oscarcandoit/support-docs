# **What is Disable SEO Indexing for WordPress?**

The **Disable SEO Indexing** feature gives HighLevel users direct control over whether their WordPress sites are visible to search engines. It helps maintain privacy for development, staging, or private websites by automatically applying **noindex** and **nofollow** rules via the site’s **robots.txt** file and **meta tags** — all directly from the HighLevel dashboard.

```
Important: Only Admin-level users have permission to access and modify this setting.
```

## **Feature Details**

Learn about the technical aspects of how the Disable SEO Indexing feature protects your WordPress sites.

- **robots.txt Modification:** Automatically adds noindex, nofollow rules to your site’s robots.txt file, instructing search engines not to crawl or index your pages.

- **Meta Tag Injection:** A <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow"> tag is embedded into your site’s HTML header to reinforce noindex instructions.

- **Admin-Only Access:** Only users with Admin privileges can view or modify the SEO indexing setting.

- **Real-Time Updates:** Setting changes are instantly applied—no need to manually update WordPress files or plugins.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I disable individual pages from being indexed by search engines?** No, the current feature is designed at the site level, meaning it disables the entire website from being indexedand does not allow for page-by-page exclusions.

**Q: Does disabling SEO indexing affect my site’s visitors?**

No, it only prevents search engines from indexing the site. It does not affect site performance or user accessibility.

**Q: Can I still use SEO plugins like Yoast or RankMath?**

Yes, but HighLevel’s SEO indexing setting will take priority over WordPress plugin settings regarding indexing.

**Q: Does this block all types of bots?**

No, it primarily affects compliant search engine bots. Non-compliant bots or scrapers might still attempt access.

**Q: Will disabling SEO indexing stop Google Analytics tracking?**

No, tracking and analytics remain functional even when SEO indexing is disabled.

**Q: How can I verify that my site is not indexed?**

Use Google Search Console’s “URL Inspection” tool, or inspect your site’s robots.txt and page HTML source to verify the noindex settings.

**Q: Can non-admin users modify SEO indexing?**

No, only Admin-level users can manage this setting for WordPress installations inside HighLevel.
