As a user on the Ecommerce store, browsing through the list of products was a difficult task. Many products were left unexplored and also led to complex user experience on the website. To tackle this we are bringing a brand new element for our Ecommerce stores - Search bar! Store owners can now add the Search bar element in 2 ways: Navigation menu, and as a dedicated element in the website.

## **How to use?**

1. Navigate to the page builder of your store, and add the Search bar Element. This would be under the Store section in the "Add elements."
2. If you would like to enable the Search bar in your navigation menu, you can use the "Show Search bar" toggle present in the navigation menu settings.
3. Configure properties for the Search bar. Some of the properties that can be configured are:
   - Search button color
   - Search input box text and background color
   - Search dropdown text and background color
   - Border color for input field and dropdown
   - Font size and weights.
4. Click on save/Publish to view your changes in your site!

## **Note:**

- Only websites will stores can add this element into any page (Store, non-store).
- Navigation menu customization for searchbar is limited. All customization options are available only in the standalone element.
- The search suggestions (Dropdown) will have search results searching from the title/name of the product.
- Upon clicking on search, the user is navigated to the product list page, showing search results, which would search based on title as well as description.
