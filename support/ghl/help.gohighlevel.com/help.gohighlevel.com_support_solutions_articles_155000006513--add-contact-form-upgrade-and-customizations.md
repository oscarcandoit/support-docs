Admins can choose which fields appear (including custom fields), set required fields, and reorder the form to match team workflows. The result is faster data entry, better data quality, and a consistent experience across desktop and mobile.

# **What is the Add Contact Modal Upgrade and Customization of Contact Form?**

The upgraded Add Contact experience replaces the classic pop-up with a modern slide-out and adds admin controls for which fields show up and in what order. By aligning the form with your process and using required fields for must-have data, you reduce errors at the source and standardize intake across your team.

Designed for productivity, the slide-out modal supports **standard** and**custom fields**, **drag-and-drop field ordering**, **field-level Required** toggles, **Preview**, and **unsaved-changes** protection. Admins define the layout once; all users then enjoy a consistent, responsive create flow with Save and Save & Add Another actions.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Add Contact Modal Upgrade & Customization**

These benefits focus on speed, data accuracy, and governance—so you capture the right data the first time.

- **Faster entry:** Slide-out UI keeps you on the page while creating contacts.

- **Cleaner data:** Show only the fields your team actually needs; hide the rest.

- **Higher quality:** Make critical fields required (for example, **Contact Type**) to prevent incomplete records.

- **Works with custom fields:** Include **contact-level custom fields** so your unique data points are captured at creation.

- **Admin control:** Admins govern the layout so standards stay consistent while users focus on selling.


* * *

## **Admin Permissions & Access**

Limiting layout control to admins protects your data model while allowing end users to focus on selling and support.

- **Who can customize the layout?** Admin-level users in the sub-account (via Roles & Permissions).

- **Who can create contacts?** Any user with access to the Contacts area can open **Add Contact** and use the configured form.


* * *

## **Duplicates & Data Quality Tips**

Contact intake quality depends on how duplicates are handled. Configure deduplication preferences so new entries behave the way you expect.

- Configure **Settings → Business Profile → Contact Deduplication Preferences** to control matching behavior (choose primary/secondary match fields like **Email** or **Phone**).

- **CSV imports** always check email/phone and merge matches—duplicates cannot be created via CSV.

- If duplicates slip in from forms or integrations, you can **merge up to 10 contacts** and choose a master record.


* * *

## **How To Setup the Customization of the Add contact Modal**

A short, sequenced setup prevents rework and ensures your team starts in a smooth, consistent state.

**Step 1: Open the Add Contact sidebar**

In your Sub-Account, Go to **Contacts → Smart Lists → + Add Contact** to launch the modal.

**Step 2: Customize the form (admins)**

Click **Customize Form** → Add/Remove **standard** and **contact-level custom** fields; drag to reorder.

**Step 3: Set required fields**

Turn on **Required** for any field that **must** be completed before saving the contact form.

**Step 4: Preview & Save**

Use **Preview** to validate, then save the layout for your team.

**Step 5: (Optional) Automate next steps via Workflows**

Use a **Contact Created** trigger in a **Workflow** to send welcomes, assign owners, or tag new contacts automatically.

* * *

## **Accessing the Add Contact Modal**

Everyone on your team uses the same entry point to create new contacts, ensuring a consistent, predictable experience.

1. Go to **Contacts → Smart Lists → + Add Contact** to launch the slide-out modal.

2. Complete the required fields, then choose an action:





   - **Save** to create the contact
   - **Save & Add Another** for rapid back-to-back entries, or
   - **Cancel** to exit without saving

```
Note: If you try to close the modal without saving changes, you’ll get an unsaved-changes prompt to confirm.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Who can customize the Add Contact form layout?**

Admin-level users in the sub-account (via Roles & Permissions). Regular users use the configured form.

**Q: Can I include custom fields on the Add Contact form?**

Yes. Any **contact-level custom field** can be added, reordered, and marked required. Manage fields in **Settings → Custom Fields**.

**Q: How do I prevent duplicate contacts during intake?**

Configure **Contact Deduplication Preferences** (choose email/phone matching). CSV imports auto-merge by email/phone and can’t create duplicates.

**Q: What automations pair well with this?**

Start with a **Contact Created** workflow to assign owners, tag by source, and send welcomes; use **Create Contact** and **Update Contact Field** actions as needed.

**Q: Does “Save & Add Another” keep the previous values?**

It creates the contact and reopens a blank form for the next entry. Use workflows to auto-apply tags/owners if you need consistency.

**Q: Do modal-required fields affect CSV imports or API creates?**No. Required rules in the Add Contact modal apply to manual entry only. CSV imports and API requests have their own validations.

**Q: Will users see my layout changes immediately?**Yes for new sessions; existing users may need to refresh the Contacts page to load the latest configuration.
