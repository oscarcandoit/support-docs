# Login As User (Agency Admin Only)

Modified on: Tue, 15 Jul, 2025 at 2:02 PM

```
Note: This is accessible for Agency Admin users only. Users with other roles will not see this option.
```

This feature allows Agency Admins to step in as their Users; whether that is to troubleshoot, configure, update settings or respond to a customer as the user they logged in as. Previously agency admins had to log out & log in multiple times to make any changes in their users’ accounts or to respond on behalf of their customers. In this article, we will cover how to switch between users.

## **How to use this feature?**

On logging in as a different user, the agency admin can make all the changes in the account which they previously needed the user to be logged in as themselves to do.

The switch account option also provides the Agency Admin the ability to get redirected to the agency admin account from the user’s account.

This feature also comes with its own Search functionality which you can use to search for a user's email address or name to be able to log in as them.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do audit logs register the changes made by the Agency Admin when logged in as the user?**

In this first phase of this release, we will capture the account user’s details (not agency admin’s) as a change log on the Audit Log page. The next phase of this release when it is developed will capture the agency admin & the account user’s details on Audit Logs.
