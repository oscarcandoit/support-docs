## Are You Struggling to Juggle Showings, Clients & Follow-Ups?

You’re great at helping clients buy and sell homes—but you didn’t sign up to manage endless admin work.

Do any of these sound familiar?

❌ You’re double-booked between a buyer consult and a seller walkthrough

❌ You lose hot leads because you didn’t follow up fast enough

❌ Managing documents, showings, and reminders is all over the place

❌ Clients ghost you after valuation requests

❌ You can’t tell which leads are serious and which are wasting your time

You’re not alone. Most real estate consultants are overwhelmed by the day-to-day—because they’re doing everything manually.

* * *

## What If Your Real Estate Consultancy Ran Itself?

With HighLevel, you can:

✅ Let clients book consultations, showings & valuations on autopilot

✅ Send instant follow-ups so no lead slips through the cracks

✅ Automate document requests, listing updates, and reminders

✅ Track every buyer, seller, and deal from first touch to close

✅ Get real-time insights on what’s working—and what’s not

## What You'll Learn in This Playbook

✅ How to automate scheduling & confirmations for buyer/seller meetings

✅ How to follow up instantly with prospects and inquiries

✅ How to manage your pipeline, clients, and deals efficiently

✅ How to automate payment collection (if you charge retainers or consult fees)

✅ How to track your revenue and lead sources in one dashboard

* * *

# Step 1: Automate Appointment Booking for Buyers & Sellers

## Why It Matters

72% of real estate clients choose the first consultant who responds.

Online scheduling boosts appointment conversion rates by 25–30%.

* * *

### 1.1 Set Up Automated Booking Links

✅ Create separate booking links for:

- Buyer Consultations

- Listing Walkthroughs

- Property Valuations

- Virtual Calls


✅ Embed your booking links:

- On your website

- In Google Business Profile

- In Instagram link-in-bio

- Inside email/text campaigns


**Use Case**: A first-time buyer clicks your listing ad, lands on your funnel, and books a call instantly without speaking to you—saving time and reducing drop-off.

#### [How to Set Up Booking Links](http://how%20to%20set%20up%20booking%20link/)

* * *

### 1.2 Send Automatic Reminders

✅ SMS, email, and WhatsApp reminders for scheduled calls

✅ Reduce ghosting or late reschedules

✅ Include calendar links & directions to the meeting/showing

[How to Automate Appointment Reminders](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001165881-how-to-build-automated-appointment-follow-up-surveys-in-workflow-builder)

* * *

### 1.3 Smartly Route Appointments

✅ Assign time blocks for different services (e.g., “Virtual tours” or “Walkthroughs”)

✅ Sync your calendar so no overlap with personal events

#### [How to Set Up Permission for Assignment](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000982601-user-permissions-assigned-data-and-owners)

* * *

# Step 2: Automate Lead Follow-Ups

## Why It Matters

Leads go cold fast—responding in under 5 minutes boosts conversion by 9X.

**60%** of consultants don’t follow up more than once.

* * *

### 2.1 Set Up Automated Nurture Sequences

✅ Follow up with:

- New lead inquiries

- Valuation requests

- Buyer consultation forms

- Facebook/Google ad leads


✅ Mix of email + SMS = best response rates

**Example SMS**:

“Hi Julie, thanks for reaching out about selling your home. Want to book a quick walkthrough this week? Here's my calendar: \[Link\]”

#### [How to Automate Quote Follow-Ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001165881-how-to-build-automated-appointment-follow-up-surveys-in-workflow-builder)

* * *

### 2.2 Use AI for Instant Lead Engagement

✅ Let ConversationAI answer FAQs and qualify prospects (e.g., price range, location, urgency)

✅ Handle after-hours inquiries with automated replies

#### [How to Set Up AI-Powered Customer Support](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001335-conversation-ai-bot-explained)

* * *

### 2.3 Build Smart Lists for Follow-Up

✅ Segment by:

- Budget

- Intent (looking to buy/sell soon)

- Location

- Property type


✅ Run targeted drip campaigns for each list

#### [How to Set Up Smart Lists](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001062094-getting-started-with-smart-lists)

* * *

# Step 3: Streamline Your Pipeline, Listings & Deals

## Why It Matters

Most real estate consultants lose deals because they don’t track where people are in the process.

* * *

### 3.1 Use a Real Estate Sales Pipeline

✅ Build stages like:

- New Inquiry

- Consult Booked

- Pre-Approved

- Showings Booked

- Offer Sent

- Deal Closed


✅ Track deals & client status at a glance

#### [How to Send and Create Invoice](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001208702-how-to-create-invoices-in-highlevel)

* * *

### 3.2 Automate Document Workflows

✅ Send disclosure forms, pre-approval docs, and listing checklists automatically

✅ Trigger reminders if clients haven’t submitted docs

✅ Use integrations with tools like DocuSign for e-signature

#### [How to Set Up Payment Received](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003534-trigger-payment-received)

* * *

### 3.3 Automate Feedback Collection

✅ After showings, send automated SMS/email asking for buyer feedback

✅ Share insights with sellers to improve the listing appeal

#### [How to Automate Recurring Payment](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001219625-auto-payments-in-recurring-templates)

* * *

# Step 4: Automate Invoicing & Retainer Collection (Optional)

## Why It Matters

Some real estate consultants charge upfront fees, retainers, or consultation charges—this step helps automate it all.

* * *

### 4.1 Send One-Time Invoices

✅ Use branded invoice templates for:

- Consultation fees

- Market analysis reports

- Listing prep services


✅ Collect payments via Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, or Google Pay

#### [How to Set Up Opportunity Creation](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003499-workflow-trigger-opportunity-created)

* * *

### 4.2 Offer Subscription Services (Optional)

✅ If you run monthly coaching for investors or retainers for sellers, set up subscription billing

* * *

### 4.3 Track Revenue by Service Type

✅ Use HighLevel’s built-in reporting to track:

- Which services generate the most revenue

- Which clients are repeat buyers/sellers

- Total value of closed deals

- #### [How to Monitor Recurring Appointments](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001230991-configure-recurring-calendar-appointments)


* * *

# Step 5: Track Performance & Optimize

## Why It Matters

Knowing what works = more profit and less wasted time.

* * *

### 5.1 Use Dashboards to Track Progress

✅ View leads by source: Facebook, Google, referrals, website

✅ Measure conversion rates at each funnel stage

✅ Track showings, offers, and closed deals per week/month

#### [How to track Leads and manage](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001985-step-by-step-guide-creating-pipelines)

* * *

### 5.2 Get Smarter with Every Campaign

✅ Test which lead magnet pages or follow-up sequences convert best

✅ Double down on ads or funnels that drive qualified clients

#### [How to Create and Monitor Dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001206-how-to-create-add-dashboard-widgets)
