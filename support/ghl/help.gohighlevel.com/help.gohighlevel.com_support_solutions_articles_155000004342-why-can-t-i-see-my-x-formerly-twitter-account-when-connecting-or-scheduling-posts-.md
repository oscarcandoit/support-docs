# Why can't I see my X (formerly Twitter) account when connecting or scheduling posts?

Modified on: Thu, 12 Dec, 2024 at 9:29 AM

On December 4, 2024, our integration with X (formerly Twitter) was disabled. Due to this change you will no longer be able to create, schedule, or post directly to X using the Social Planner.

#### **What Does This Mean for You?**

- Posting to X (formerly Twitter) via the Social Planner is no longer possible. Users will not be able to connect to X in the Connections tab.
- All other social media integrations (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, TikTok) remain fully supported and operational.

#### **Why Is This Happening?**

[X's integration requirements have recently undergone significant changes](https://x.com/API/status/1693760591503266165). The new migration requirement would have added a significant monthly fee which would have resulted in a large cost passed on to customers. After working diligently to come to a reasonable agreement that would have exempted us and our users from this cost increase, we were unfortunately unable to do so.

While we are disappointed in having to remove our X integration, our efforts remain focused on refining the Social Planner and improving support for all other integrations.

Our view is that X remains a vital platform in the social media landscape. We will continue to monitor changes in their API requirements, in hopes that we can re-integrate and allow posts to be scheduled and managed on X through the Social Planner in the future.

#### **What’s Next for X on Social Planner?**

We understand the importance of X to many businesses and creators. Rest assured, our team is actively exploring options to reintroduce X support in the future with enhanced functionality and compliance with platform requirements.

We will keep you informed about our progress towards this goal.

**FAQs**

1. What would be the additional cost to retain X as an option in the Social Planner?

The platform costs would be $42,000/month ($504,000/year) for keeping access of X with the newly required enterprise V2 X API.
2. Is it possible to implement a solution that would incorporate individual API keys for X accounts?

The “bring your own API key” method is technically possible, but we don’t view this as a long-term solution.
