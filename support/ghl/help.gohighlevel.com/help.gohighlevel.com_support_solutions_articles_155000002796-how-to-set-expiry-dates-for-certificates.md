**Admin can now set expiry for certificates issued to users**

**How to set an expiry?**

**Step 1:** Expiry can either be set at the template level or at the issued certificates level

**Step 2:** At the template level expiry can be selected from the given options

```
Important: You can now customize how many days before expiry you send reminder emails. This replaces the default 2- and 7-day intervals for more control. Learn more →
```

```
Note: On expiry certificates preview won't be available for the particular user and Issued certificates have priority over template level expiry.
