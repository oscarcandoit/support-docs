## **Key Features of the Suggestions Interface**

Understand the core components that make this feature powerful and easy to use.

### **Centralized Suggestion Hub**

This hub consolidates all external listing suggestions into one organized interface, allowing you to review them efficiently. No more switching between platforms to manage updates.

### **Seamless Data Syncing**

Once a suggestion is accepted, it’s instantly updated in your Listings and distributed across all connected publisher networks. This ensures that your customers always see the most up-to-date business information, regardless of where they find you online.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What types of updates can be suggested?**

Publishers may submit changes such as business name updates, new hours, address modifications, phone number corrections, and more.

**Q: What happens after I accept a suggestion?**

The update is immediately applied to your Listings and synced with all connected directories like Google, Facebook, and Yelp.

**Q: Can I undo a rejected suggestion?**

Rejected suggestions are removed from the list, but if a publisher re-submits the same suggestion later, you’ll be able to review it again.

The system checks regularly for new submissions from publishers and will display them in the Suggestions Hub as they come in.

**Q: Is this feature available when using the Uberall Integration?**
