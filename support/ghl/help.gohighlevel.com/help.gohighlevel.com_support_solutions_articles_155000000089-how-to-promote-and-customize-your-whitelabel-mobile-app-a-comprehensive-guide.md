## **What are these features?**

### **Mobile App Promotion Tool:**

This feature streamlines the process of promoting mobile apps to your sub-accounts. Choose between Highlevel, LeadConnector, or a Whitelabel app, and with a simple click; you can make their download links available to your sub-accounts. This tool is designed to efficiently and hassle-free distribute apps to different users, whether clients or partner companies.

#### **Usage Cases:**

**Enhancing Client Engagement:** Consider an agency named "Digital Pioneers." They use the mobile app promotion tool to share their customized Whitelabel app with their clients. Now, clients can directly access their marketing campaigns, monitor progress, provide feedback, and schedule meetings with the agency from their mobile devices. This convenience fosters transparency and increases client engagement, resulting in a higher retention rate for Digital Pioneers.

**Simplifying Remote Team Management:** Imagine an agency called "Marketing Mavericks," which has a distributed team across different time zones. Promoting the Highlevel Mobile app or LeadConnector to their team members ensures everyone can view their tasks, update their progress, and communicate with clients without being tied to their desks. This makes remote work management a breeze for Marketing Mavericks and boosts their team's productivity.

**Consistent Branding across Franchisees:** Suppose "Brand Masters" is a successful marketing agency that has franchised its operations in various cities. They use the Whitelabel mobile app customizer to create an app that reflects their brand's identity and promotes it across all franchisees. This ensures a consistent branding experience for all clients, regardless of the branch they work with, enhancing the overall reputation of Brand Masters.

**Providing Added Value to Clients:** An agency named "Growth Gurus" wants to stand out in the highly competitive marketing industry. They customize the Whitelabel mobile app and promote it to their clients as an additional service, allowing them to manage their campaigns on the go. This unique offering differentiates Growth Gurus from other agencies, attracting more clients.

**Streamlining New Branch Integration:** A rapidly expanding agency, "Rapid Raptors," opens a new branch in a different region. They promote their Whitelabel mobile app to new team members, allowing them to understand the agency's processes and workflows quickly. This speeds up the integration process of the new branch and keeps their operations running smoothly.

### **Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer:**

This feature offers the flexibility to personalize your mobile app per your brand identity. You create a mobile app that reflects your brand's aesthetics by uploading your logo and splash screen image, selecting a color scheme and fonts, and arranging menu items. Furthermore, providing necessary details like your agency name, contact information, and app description gives your app a professional and complete finish.

After customizing, you can preview the app and submit it for review. Once it receives approval and goes live, your uniquely branded app is ready to be shared with your audience.

By leveraging these features, you can effectively reach a wider audience with a mobile app that aligns seamlessly with your branding guidelines, enhancing your brand's visibility and consistency across platforms.

#### **Usage cases:**

**Agency A - Consistent Visual Branding:** Agency A uses the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer to ensure consistent visual branding. They upload their logo, choose their color scheme, and select fonts that align with their visual identity. The design customizer allows the agency to match every design element to its brand, resulting in a seamless brand experience for its clients when using the app.

**Agency B - Client-Specific Branding:** This agency provides tailored marketing solutions for each client. They go one step further by creating individual mobile apps with the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer that are fully branded per each client's visual identity. They design each app to visually align with the respective client's website, social media platforms, and other marketing materials. This delights their clients and provides the end-users (the client's customers) with a familiar and consistent experience.

**Agency C - Training App with Branding:** Agency C, known for its regular training programs, uses the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer to create a branded training app. They incorporate their unique design elements into the app's user interface, ensuring that even the training platform reflects their brand. This enhances the learners' experience and cements the agency's branding in their minds.

**Agency D - Communication via Branded App:** This rapidly growing agency uses the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer to build a fully-branded communication platform. They design the app's interface to mirror their brand aesthetics, which instantly connects with their clients. Through the visually cohesive app, they can maintain efficient client communication that subtly reinforces their brand with every interaction.

**Agency E - Exuding Luxury and Sophistication:** This high-end agency uses the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer to create an app that reflects its brand's sophistication. They meticulously design every aspect of the app to resonate with the luxury and exclusivity they represent. Every element, from fonts to the color palette to the logo placement, is carefully selected to evoke a sense of elegance and premium service.

### **Competitive advantages:**

**Comprehensive Integration:** Unlike many competitors, GHL offers a fully integrated solution with its white-label promotion tool and customizer. It seamlessly integrates with GHL's CRM platform, allowing agencies to manage customer relationships, automate marketing processes, and access client data within the app. This unified approach streamlines workflows and enhances overall efficiency.

**Extensive Customization Options:** GHL's white-label customizer provides agencies with a high level of customization. From logos to color schemes, fonts, and UI elements, agencies have complete control over the app's visual identity. This level of customization ensures that the app aligns perfectly with the agency's brand, enhancing brand consistency and recognition.

**Effective App Promotion:** GHL's white-label promotion tool enables agencies to promote their customized apps to their sub-accounts effectively. Agencies can ensure their apps reach their intended audience with a few simple steps, maximizing engagement and user adoption. This feature sets GHL apart by providing a comprehensive solution for app promotion.

**Assistance with App Publication:** GHL goes beyond app customization by providing support throughout the app review and approval process. They assist agencies in getting their apps published on respective app stores, streamlining the often complex and time-consuming process. This support helps agencies navigate the app store requirements and ensure their apps go live smoothly.

**User-Friendly Interface:** GHL's white-label promotion tool and customizer are designed with a user-friendly interface. The intuitive design and ease of use enable agencies to quickly and efficiently create and customize their apps without requiring extensive technical knowledge or expertise. This user-centric approach saves time and empowers agencies to focus on their core business activities.
