3. Purchases are automatically updated in conversion and campaign statistics.

## **Benefits:**

1. Easier setup and use of product elements.
2. Improved tracking of conversion metrics.

## **How to Use:**

1. Navigate to the email marketing section.
2. Create a new email campaign.
3. Add a product element and select direct checkout.
