# Automate Badge Issuance in Workflows (Using “Issue Certificate” Action)

Modified on: Wed, 6 Aug, 2025 at 9:05 AM

## ⭐️ Overview

Badges are a lightweight, visual way to recognise milestones, progress, and engagement. While we’re actively working on a dedicated **“Issue Badge”** action, you can start issuing badges **right now** using the existing **“Issue Certificate”** workflow action.

Yes — **Badges are issued through the same action as Certificates**!

* * *

## ⚙️ How It Works

You can combine any of the supported **workflow triggers** with the existing **“Issue Certificate”** action to send a **Badge** automatically to your customers.

> ✅ Just select a **Badge template** instead of a Certificate when using the "Issue Certificate" action.

* * *

## Most Used Triggers + Use Cases

| **Workflow Trigger** | **Badge Use Cases (Example)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Lesson Completed** | "Lesson 1 Complete" Badge |
| **Category Completed** | "Module Master" Badge |
| **Product Completed** | "Certified Pro" Badge |
| **Quiz Submitted** | "Quiz Ace" Badge |
| **Survey Submitted** | "Top Responder" Badge |
| **Form Submitted** | "Quick Action Taker" Badge |
| **Task Completed** | "Milestone Unlocked" Badge |

You can find these triggers inside your **Workflow Trigger menu**, under “Courses,” “Contact,” and “Form Activities.”

* * *

## How to Set It Up?

1. Go to **Automation** \> **Workflows**

2. **Create from Scratch** or open an existing Workflow

3. Add a **Trigger** from the list above

4. Add an **Action** → select **Issue Certificate**

5. Choose a **Badge** template instead of a Certificate template

6. Save & Publish ✅


> Note: Badges are fully visual and lightweight — perfect for micro-recognition. They’ll be sent as downloadable images to your customers.

* * *

## ⏳ Coming Soon

We’re introducing a **dedicated “Issue Badge” action** to make this even clearer and easier to use. Until then, the **“Issue Certificate”** action supports both **Badges** and **Certificates** seamlessly.

How to Navigate to the Badge Builder?

- Go to “
Memberships
”
- Select the “
Credentials
” tab
- Click “
Create
” in the top-right corner
- Choose “
Create Badge
” from the dropdown
