## **Why to edit a Published campaign?**

Editing a live campaign allows users to adapt to real-time performance data, market conditions, and business needs. It ensures the campaign remains effective and relevant throughout its duration. With this functionality, users can:

- Correct errors made during the initial campaign setup.
- Optimise campaign performance based on insights from key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Respond dynamically to feedback, improving ad content or audience targeting.
- Save time by avoiding the need to pause a campaign and create a new one for minor adjustments.

This feature empowers users to refine their campaigns for better results without disrupting their ongoing advertising efforts.

* * *

## **How to Edit a Published or In-Review campaign?**

Users can now edit details of live campaigns or those in the 'In Review' state, which was previously limited to budget adjustments only. To make changes:

- Navigate to the Ad Manager home page where all campaigns are listed.
- Locate the live or in-review campaign you want to edit.
- Click on the **Edit** option available in the inline ellipsis menu for the campaign.

- The campaign builder screen will open, allowing the user to make changes to permitted fields (listed in Section 3).

**Note:** Once any changes are made, an "Unpublished Changes" tag will appear at the top right of the screen.

## **What fields of a published campaign can be edited?**

The following fields can be modified for published campaigns:

- **Campaign Name**
- **CTA Button**: Change or update the call-to-action button.
- **Lead Generation Form**: If the objective is Lead Generation, you can switch to another form or create a new one.
- **Website**: Alter the website URL if the objective is Website Traffic.
- **Special Ad Category**: Add or change the category if needed.
- **Placements**: Update where your ads are displayed.
- **Ad Text and Media**: Revise the content and visuals of your ad.
- **Budget**: Adjust the amount allocated for the campaign.
- **Geographic Location**: Modify the targeted locations.
- **Target Audience**: Change interests, lookalike, or retargeting parameters.
- **End Date**: Update the end date if a lifetime budget is selected.

* * *

## **What fields of a published/In-review campaign cannot be altered?**

Certain fields remain locked for editing after a campaign is published:

- **Campaign Objective**
- **Facebook Page**: The page used to publish the campaign.
- **Start Date**
- **Budget Type**: Switching from Daily to Lifetime budget or vice versa is not permitted.

* * *

## **How to discard the changes made to the published campaign?**

If a user wants to revert the campaign back to its original state without applying the changes:

1. Click on the **Back** button at the top left of the campaign builder screen.
2. A prompt will appear -



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155039431990/original/FZtbwa4_vmJR8J9OuK3_ezxtgUUx2OsYIw.png?1736284093)
3. Select **Discard** to keep the original campaign intact and ignore the changes made to the campaign.

* * *

## **How to Publish the ad campaign after making changes?**

To apply the changes to the campaign:

1. After making the desired edits, click on **Publish Ad Now** button on the review page.
2. A confirmation dialog will appear.

3. Upon confirmation, the campaign will move to the "In Review" state.
4. Facebook will review the changes. Once approved, the updated campaign will go live.
5. If the edits result in errors, the campaign status will change to **Failed**, with the reason displayed next to the failed status in the tooltip.
