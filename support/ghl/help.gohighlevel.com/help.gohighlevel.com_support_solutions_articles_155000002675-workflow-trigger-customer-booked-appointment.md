# **What is Customer Booked Appointment Workflow Trigger?**

The Customer Booked Appointment workflow trigger activates whenever a customer books an appointment using a booking link or online scheduling system without intervention from your team. This trigger is essential for businesses that want to automate follow-up actions, reminders, and notifications based on scheduled appointments. It works only for regular appointments and does not support recurring appointments.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Customer Booked Appointment Trigger**

Automating appointment-based workflows can significantly improve operational efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Here are some key benefits:

- **Automated Reminders:** Reduce no-show rates by sending timely appointment reminders via email or SMS.

- **Improved Customer Experience:** Keep customers informed and engaged with automated confirmation messages and follow-ups.

- **Efficient Team Notifications:** Ensure that the relevant team members are automatically notified whenever an appointment is booked.

- **Flexible Customization:** Use filters to trigger workflows for specific calendars, calendar groups, or customers with particular tags.

- **Better Resource Management:** By automating reminders and follow-ups, your team can focus on delivering services rather than manually managing schedules.

* * *

## **Configuring the Customer Booked Appointment Trigger**

Follow these steps to set up the Customer Booked Appointment trigger in your workflow:

### **Access Workflow Builder**

Go to the **"Automation"** section. Create a new workflow from scratch or select the existing workflow where you want to use the "Customer Booked Appointment" trigger.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can this trigger be used for recurring appointments?**

No, the Customer Booked Appointment trigger only works for normal (one-time) appointments. Recurring appointments are not supported.

**Q. How can I trigger different workflows for different types of appointments?**

You can use filters such as **“In Calendar”** or **“In Calendar Group”** to target specific appointment types and set up separate workflows for each.

**Q. What happens if a team member manually books the appointment on behalf of the customer?**

This trigger only activates when the customer independently books an appointment through a booking link. Manually booked appointments will not trigger the workflow.

**Q. Can I send reminders at multiple intervals, like 48 hours and 24 hours before the appointment?**

Yes, you can add multiple reminder actions within the same workflow and set different wait times for each (e.g., wait for 48 hours, then send the first reminder; wait for another 24 hours, then send the second reminder).

**Q. How can I track appointments booked by high-priority clients?**

You can use the **“Has Tag”** filter to create a workflow that triggers only when clients with a specific tag (e.g., “VIP Client”) book an appointment. This way, you can ensure timely follow-ups and special handling for important clients.
