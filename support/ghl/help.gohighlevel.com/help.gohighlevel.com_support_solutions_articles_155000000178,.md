1. **Launch Safari**
Open Safari by clicking on the Safari icon located in the dock or by searching for "Safari" using Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and selecting the application.

2. **Access Safari Preferences**

In the top menu, click on "Safari" and then select "Preferences" or "Settings" from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (Cmd + comma) to directly access the Preferences window.
