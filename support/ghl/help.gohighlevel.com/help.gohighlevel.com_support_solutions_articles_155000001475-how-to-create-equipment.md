# **What is Equipment?**

Equipment refers to shared tools, devices, or physical resources that are needed for services offered in your business — like projectors, therapy tables, or treatment chairs. When added to your system, these resources can be linked to calendars and availability settings to prevent scheduling conflicts. This ensures that only available equipment is booked, allowing for smooth operations and improved client experiences.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Equipment**

Using equipment in your scheduling setup improves visibility and prevents overlaps with limited-use resources.

- Prevent double-bookings of shared resources

- Assign equipment to specific calendars or services

- Automate resource availability during appointment scheduling

- Reduce manual coordination and increase reliability

- Improve staff efficiency and service quality

- Manage resources across multiple locations


* * *

## **How to Set Up Equipment**

Creating equipment ensures availability logic is respected across all scheduled appointments.

### **Step 1:** Enable Equipment

- Go to **Settings > Calendar Settings**

- Select the **Preferences** tab in the secondary navigation ribbon

- Select the **Account Preference** tab located under preferences

- Toggle on the blue switch labeled **Equipments**, located in the Services section

### **Step 3:** Provide Equipment Detail

## **Editing or Deleting Equipment**

Managing equipment over time helps keep your system up to date. Whether you're renaming a resource or removing one no longer in use, it's important to keep the list current.

- Navigate to **Settings > Calendar Settings**

- Select the **Equipment** tab in the ribbon under **Calendar Settings**

- Click the **3 Dots** icon. Select **Edit** to edit the equipment **or Delete** to delete the equipment

- Make your changes and click **Save**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What is the difference between Rooms and Equipment?**

Rooms are physical spaces, like offices or studios. Equipment refers to tools or resources, like chairs or machines. Both can be scheduled as resources.

**Q: Can equipment be assigned to more than one calendar?**

Yes. Equipment can be linked to multiple calendars, but it can only be used in one appointment at a time.

**Q: How do I add multiple versions of the same equipment?**

You can set the quantity for each equipment item during creation. For example, if you have three identical massage tables, you only need to create one entry (e.g., “Massage Table”) and set the quantity to 3.

**Q: What happens if I delete equipment that is in use?**

Deleting it may affect scheduling and remove the availability restrictions tied to it. Review connected calendars before removing any equipment.

**Q: Can I generate reports for equipment usage?**

There is no native reporting for equipment usage, but appointments tied to specific resources can be reviewed manually via calendars.
