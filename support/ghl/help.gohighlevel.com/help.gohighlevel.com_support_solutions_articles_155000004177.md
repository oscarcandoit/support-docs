We’re thrilled to announce a major update to our Funnel Analytics: Pie Chart Visualization! This feature provides an easy way to see page views and sales distribution across funnels, websites, or specific steps. Plus, you can apply filters to dig deeper for more detailed insights.

This new pie chart visualization makes it easier than ever to track and improve performance by providing clear, visual insights into page views and sales. With it, you can refine your traffic and conversion strategies more effectively.

What’s New & Key Features:

1.Pie Chart Visualization:

You can now view the breakdown of page views and sales in a pie chart format. This chart adapts based on your chosen filters, like date range or specific funnels or websites, so you can get exactly the information you need.

2.Page Views and Sales Breakdown:

With this chart, you can quickly see how page views and sales are distributed across different funnels or websites. This helps you understand where traffic is flowing and where sales are happening, so you can focus on optimizing these areas to increase conversions.

3.Funnel and Website Comparison:

This feature allows you to compare the performance of multiple funnels or websites. It shows which ones are generating the most page views and sales, helping you prioritize your optimization efforts where they’ll make the biggest impact.

4.Step-Level Analysis:

You can also analyze individual steps within a funnel or website. This lets you identify high-performing steps and spot areas that may need improvements, so you can enhance overall performance.
