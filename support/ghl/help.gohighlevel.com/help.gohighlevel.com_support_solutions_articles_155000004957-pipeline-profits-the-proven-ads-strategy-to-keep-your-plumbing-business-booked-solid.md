### **Why This Playbook Matters?**

Most plumbers rely on referrals, HomeAdvisor, or word-of-mouth. But in a digital-first world, that won’t fill your schedule consistently.

**Industry Metrics**:

✅ 86% of customers search Google before hiring a plumber

✅ 75% of homeowners book with the first plumber who contacts them

✅ Businesses that appear in the top 3 Google results get **2X more calls**

> If your competitors are running ads and you’re not, you're already losing out—even before a wrench hits the pipe.

This playbook shows you exactly how to build a lead engine through ads—with **zero guesswork**.

### **What You'll Learn?**

✅ How to dominate Google Local Services Ads (LSA) and get booked first

✅ How to target local homeowners & property managers on Facebook/Instagram

✅ How to set & control your ad budget for ROI

✅ How to track every lead & automate your follow-ups

✅ How to bring back lost leads using retargeting ads

✅ How to do it all with HighLevel—no tech experience needed

* * *

### **Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads**

#### **Why It Matters?**

When a pipe bursts, no one waits. They **Google it. Then book fast.**

You need to be at the top— **or someone else gets that call.**

**Fact**: LSA (Local Services Ads) cost less per job than traditional Google Ads when set up correctly.

#### **1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

- Appear at the top for searches like:

  - “Emergency plumber near me”

  - “Drain cleaning services”

  - “Toilet repair urgent”
- Only pay for verified leads

- Get the **Google Guaranteed** badge to increase trust & conversions (up to 30% higher)


**Example**:

A plumbing company targeting “24/7 leak repair” saw a **35% conversion rate** and $25 CPL via LSA.

* * *

#### **1.2 Run High-Intent Google Search Ads (PPC)**

Bid on job-ready keywords like:

- “Plumber open now”

- “Water heater installation in \[City\]”

- “Sewer inspection specialists”


Pair with HighLevel call tracking to see what works.

Optimize landing pages with CTAs like “Book Emergency Service Now.”

**Pro Tip**: Start with **$30–$50/day**. Focus on high-intent keywords first.

* * *

#### **1.3 Call Tracking for Google Business**

- Use a **tracking number** on your GBP & website

- Recover lost leads with **Missed-Call Text-Back**

- Automate follow-up via SMS/Email/WhatsApp


**Example**:

50% of calls to plumbers go unanswered after hours.

Text-back automation recovers **20–30%** of these leads.

### **Step 2: Run Facebook & Instagram Ads to Target Local Customers**

#### **Why It Matters?**

People may not search daily, but when their sink overflows or water heater dies—they need you fast.

Social ads keep you **top of mind** so they call **you** first.

#### [Overview about the Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002433-overview-of-ad-manager)

#### [Connect Facebook with Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003044-connect-facebook-with-ad-manager)

#### **2.1 Create High-Converting Facebook Ads**

**Use:**

- **Before/After Photos** of water damage restoration

- **Customer testimonials**

- **Seasonal Offers** (e.g., “Winter Pipe Check – $59 only!”)


**Target by**:

- Zip codes + radius

- Homeowners 30–65+

- Interests like home improvement, real estate


**Example**:

✅ Offer: “$50 off Water Heater Installation this week!”

✅ Copy: “Need hot water again? Schedule your install now & save!”

* * *

#### **2.2 Use Retargeting Ads**

- Show ads to site visitors who didn’t book

- Offer second-chance incentives (10% off if booked today)

- Promote seasonal maintenance (pipe insulation in winter, AC drain line clean-up in summer)


**Example**:

“Still dealing with a slow drain? Book today & save 10%!”

All leads sync with HighLevel CRM.

Automate:

75% of leads that don’t get followed up in **5 minutes** are lost.

Use **HighLevel workflows** to follow up within seconds.

### **Step 3: Capture & Convert Every Lead with AI & Automation**

#### **3.1 Use Chat Widgets on Your Website**

- ### Let visitors text you instead of calling

- Capture leads while you’re on a job

- Convert more traffic with lead magnets like “Free Pipe Inspection”

### **Step 4: Track & Optimize Every Ad for Maximum ROI**

#### **4.1 Monitor CPL, CPA, and ROI**

- #### Know your **cost per lead**, **cost per booked job**, and **customer lifetime value**

- Reallocate budget to winning ads

- Pause underperformers


#### [How to Set Up Call Tracking for Plumbing Ads](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981393-how-to-set-up-call-tracking-number-pool-)

* * *

#### **4.2 A/B Test Everything**

- Test images, videos, and copy

- Try new CTAs or discount formats

- Optimize based on **CTR & conversion rates**


Plumbing companies that test 3 versions of an ad get **2x more conversions** than those that don’t.

* * *

### **Final Thoughts: More Ads = More Jobs**
