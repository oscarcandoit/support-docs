### **Why This Playbook Matters?**

#### Most cleaning and maintenance businesses rely on **referrals, word-of-mouth, and occasional walk-ins**, but in today’s digital-first world, that **isn’t enough to keep your schedule full**.

#### **Industry Metrics:**  ✅ **90% of consumers** search online before hiring a cleaning service.  ✅ **78% of service bookings** come from businesses that appear in the **top 3 search results**.  ✅ **60% of homeowners** say online ads influence their choice of service provider.

#### If your competitors are running ads and you’re not, **you’re losing jobs before customers even call.**

#### This playbook will help you take control of your marketing—with **Google, Facebook, and Instagram ad strategies** that attract **high-intent customers, reduce wasted ad spend, and keep your team busy with profitable jobs.**

### **What You'll Learn?**

#### ✅ How to dominate **Google Local Services Ads (LSA)** and rank when customers search.  ✅ How to target **homeowners, offices, and businesses** with **Facebook & Instagram ads**.  ✅ How to set the **right budget** and avoid overspending.  ✅ How to track every **call & message** to measure ROI.  ✅ How to automate **lead follow-ups** so you never lose an inquiry.  ✅ How to use **retargeting ads** to capture leads who didn’t book.

#### **Let’s build an ad strategy that gets results.**

### **Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### When customers need cleaning services, the **first place they go is Google.**  ✅ **70% of customers** hire a provider who shows up in the first **five search results**.  ✅ **Google Local Services Ads (LSA)** deliver **leads, not clicks**, making them **highly cost-effective**.  ✅ The **average cost per lead (CPL) for cleaning businesses** on Google Ads is **$15 - $50**, but can be **lower with proper targeting**.

#### **1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

- #### Appear at the **top of Google search results** for searches like **“House Cleaning Near Me”** or **“Office Janitorial Services.”**

- #### **Pay only for valid leads**—not just clicks.

- #### Get **Google Guaranteed certification** (boosts conversion rates by **30%**).

- #### Target **high-intent service categories** like **Deep Cleaning, Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning, Commercial Cleaning.**


#### **Example:**  A cleaning business running **LSA ads** for "Move-Out Cleaning" sees **higher-intent leads** and **30-40% close rates**.

#### [How to Set Up Google Local Services Ads](https://support.google.com/localservices/answer/6224841?hl=en&co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS)

#### **1.2 Run High-Intent Google Search Ads (PPC Ads)**

- #### **Bid on job-ready keywords**, like:


  - #### “Apartment cleaning near me”

  - #### “Commercial janitorial service”

  - #### “Same-day home cleaning”
- #### **Use call tracking** to measure ad success.

- #### **Optimize landing pages** with clear CTAs like **"Book a Free Cleaning Estimate."**


#### **Budget Tip:**  Start with **$30/day**, focusing on **high-intent searches** for the best ROI.

#### [How to Set Up PPC Campaigns for HVAC](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001220947-how-to-set-up-google-ad-conversion-actions)

#### **1.3 Enable Call Tracking on Google Business Profile**

- #### Use a **call tracking number** to monitor which ads generate the most calls.

- #### Track **missed calls and messages** from ads.

- #### Automate **SMS follow-ups** for missed calls to **recover up to 30% of lost leads**.


#### **Example:**  If **50% of calls go unanswered**, a **missed-call text automation** can recover **15-20% of lost jobs.**

### **Step 2: Run Facebook & Instagram Ads to Target Local Customers**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Most people **don’t search for a cleaner daily**, but when they need one, **you want to be their first choice**.  ✅ Facebook & Instagram **build brand awareness**, keeping you **top-of-mind**.  ✅ Cost-per-click (CPC) on Facebook is **lower than Google Ads**, making it **a great low-cost strategy**.  ✅ A **well-targeted Facebook ad** can generate **leads for as low as $5 - $15 per lead**.

#### [How to Set Up AI Chat Widgets](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)
