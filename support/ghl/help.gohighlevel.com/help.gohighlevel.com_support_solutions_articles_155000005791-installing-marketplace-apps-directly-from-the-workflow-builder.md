## **Accessing the App Directory in Workflows**

Inside the Workflow Builder, you’ll see a “Discover” button located within the action panel. Clicking this opens a full list of available marketplace apps without ever leaving your workflow. This integrated view brings convenience and clarity to app discovery.

## **Browsing and Filtering Apps**

To help you find the right app quickly, the in-workflow app directory supports categorized browsing. You can explore apps by:

•Top Installed – Most frequently added by users.

•Top Free – Popular apps available at no cost.

•Top Paid – Best-selling premium integrations.

•Newly Added – Recently published or updated apps.

This categorization gives you a clear overview of what’s trending or newly available.

## **Using the Global Search Bar**

Need something specific? Use the Global Search Bar to find:

•GoHighLevel-built workflow actions

•Marketplace app actions

•Workflow triggers from both built-in and marketplace sources

This universal search ensures you’re not toggling between tabs to locate what you need.

## **Viewing App Details and Installing Apps**

Once you’ve found an app, click on it to view detailed information including:

•Overview of what the app does

•Available actions and triggers

•Pricing (if applicable)

•Reviews and ratings

You’ll also see a prominent Install button that lets you add the app to your account instantly. After installation, the app’s actions and triggers will appear in your “All Actions” panel in the workflow builder, just like built-in steps.

## **Identifying App Updates**

If you’ve already installed an app and new actions have since been added by the developer, you’ll see an Update tag next to the app in the Discover panel. This helps you stay informed about new capabilities that you can start using right away without needing to reinstall the app.

## **FAQ**

Q: Do I need to leave the workflow builder to install a new app?

No. You can now browse, install, and explore app options directly within the workflow builder using the Discover button.

Q: Where do I find actions for apps I’ve already installed?

All installed app actions are accessible under the “All Actions” section in the workflow builder.

Q: What does the Update tag mean next to an app?

It indicates that the app has new actions or triggers that were not available when you originally installed it.

⸻

By bringing the app marketplace directly into workflows, managing your integrations is easier and more seamless than ever. Use the Discover feature to keep your automations powerful, up-to-date, and connected with the tools you use most.
