Modified on: Wed, 19 Nov, 2025 at 6:02 AM

Schedule Email Campaign with Batch Delivery (Drip Mode) is a feature that allows you to send the email campaign in timed batches rather than to your whole audience at once. This helps control traffic to your websites or funnels and prevents potential tension on your server.

In Email Marketing, when you create a batch schedule email, there will be the option to select the template, design the content, and choose the settings of adding receipt and delivery method as a batch schedule where you can select the batch quantity, and days and time.
