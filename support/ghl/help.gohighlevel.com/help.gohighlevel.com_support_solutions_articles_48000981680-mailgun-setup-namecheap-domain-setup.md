If you are setting up a **main** domain like companyname.com, the host name will be **@**

B. Head back to Mailgun and Copy the first TXT record here **v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all**

Value: we will paste the first copied TXT record here v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48284379641/original/OtndbakIxEwGec0uzyy6VhrQ9ahdwqWR4g.png?1677632355)**

This will affect your existing Gsuite account to capture incoming emails for the main domain if you have **Gmail** selected originally. Make sure you are using a subdomain for Mailgun.
