- A clear **business use case explanation** (what your business does and how you use Meta platforms).

-Here is a **Appeal Template to Submit to Meta**

Dear Meta Business Support Team,

I am reaching out to appeal the recent restriction or lock placed on our WhatsApp Business account. Our business is committed to complying with all Meta and WhatsApp Business policies, and we believe this action may have been applied in error or due to a misunderstanding.

Please find below the details of our account:

- **Business Name:** \[Your Business Name\]

- **Business Manager ID:** \[Your Business Manager ID\]

- **WhatsApp Phone Number:** \[Your WhatsApp Business Number\]

- **WABA ID (if known):** \[Your WhatsApp Business Account ID\]

- **Website of the Business:\[Your Website of the Business\]**


We kindly request a thorough review of our account. If there are any specific actions required on our part to resolve this issue or verify compliance, we are happy to cooperate fully.

Thank you for your time and support. We look forward to resolving this matter quickly.

### **Step 4: Wait for Meta’s Response**

- Most appeals are reviewed within a few business days.

- **Avoid submitting multiple appeals**, as this can delay the review process.


* * *

### **Pro Tips to Avoid Future Bans**

- Do **not** send spam or unapproved promotional messages.

- Always use **Meta-approved WhatsApp templates**.

- Complete and maintain your **business verification** status.

- Regularly monitor your **phone number quality rating**:

→ Go to **WhatsApp Manager > Phone Number > Settings**.
