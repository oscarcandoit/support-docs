# **What is PayPal Support for Calendars?**

PayPal Support for Calendars adds PayPal as a payment gateway in Service (v2), Round-Robin, Collective, and Personal calendars. Once connected, PayPal appears at checkout so bookers can pay with their PayPal balance, linked bank, or card. You control pricing per calendar and collect the funds directly in your PayPal account.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of PayPal Support for Calendars**

- Offer **one-click checkout**; no card entry required for PayPal customers.

- **Works side-by-side** with Stripe, Square, NMI, and Authorize .net—clients pick the method they prefer.

- **Instant** fund settlement in your PayPal dashboard.

- Fully **PCI-compliant**; HighLevel never stores PayPal credentials.

* * *

## **Supported Payment Providers**

HighLevel calendars now support:

- PayPal (new)
- Stripe
- Authorize .net
- NMI
- Square
- Razorpay\*

```
PayPal and Razorpay cannot both be active at the same time. If both are connected, Razorpay will be used by default.
```

* * *

## **PayPal Compatibility & Limitations**

This section clarifies where PayPal does—and does not—work so you can avoid setup issues.

- Supported for all Calendar types and new Services (v2).

- Not supported for the legacy Service Menu (v1).

- Cannot be combined with Razorpay; Razorpay becomes the default if both are connected.

- Follows the same currency, partial-payment, and coupon rules already in Calendar Payments.

## **How to Set Up PayPal for Calendar Bookings**

Connecting PayPal takes just a few minutes and immediately unlocks PayPal checkout on every eligible calendar.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I offer both PayPal and credit-card checkout?**

A: Yes. If Stripe, Square, NMI, or Authorize .net are also connected, your booking widget will display PayPal alongside card options. The client chooses at checkout. (help.gohighlevel.com)

**Q: What happens if I also connect Razorpay?**

A: HighLevel prioritizes Razorpay. To use PayPal instead, disconnect Razorpay or change your default gateway.

**Q: Does PayPal work with recurring-appointment calendars?**

A: Yes, provided you are using the new Service (v2) or other supported calendar types. Legacy Service Menu (v1) and custom in-app recurring appointments are not supported.

**Q: Where do the funds go?**

A: Payments settle directly into the PayPal account you connected under Payments ➜ Integrations.

**Q: Can I refund PayPal payments inside HighLevel?**

A: Not yet—refunds must be processed from your PayPal dashboard.

**Q: Is PayPal available in my country?**

A: PayPal availability depends on PayPal’s supported regions and currencies. Check PayPal’s documentation if you are unsure.
