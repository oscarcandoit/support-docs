# Customizing Quiz Result Pages

Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 10:48 AM

HighLevel’s enhanced **Quiz Builder** now includes powerful tools for customizing the **Result Page** — with drag-and-drop section management, section templates, visibility controls, and a unified 0–100 global score scale.

These upgrades make building, analyzing, and maintaining quizzes faster, more flexible, and fully standardized across your account.

* * *

# **What is Global Score Tier Management in** **Quiz Section** **?**

Score Tier Management empower you to organize your result pages intuitively and score quizzes consistently. The Section Control panel lets you view, rearrange, add, or hide entire result page sections, while the Score Tier system ensures that every quiz uses a normalized 0–100 scoring range for reliable comparisons and automations.

Each quiz includes:

- A **left-hand Section Visibility panel** showing all result page elements.

- **Drag-and-drop reordering** of sections.

- **Section templates** for fast building.

- **Hide/Delete tools** for cleaner layouts.

- **Score Tier configuration** for global scoring logic.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Section Control and Score Tiers**

These features simplify result-page customization and standardize how quiz scores are presented, making analytics, reporting, and automation far more accurate.

- **Centralized section management:** Quickly navigate between all sections from one panel.

- **Drag-and-drop editing:** Instantly reorder quiz elements without rebuilding.

- **Prebuilt section templates:** Add formatted blocks like “Overall Score” or “Call to Action” in one click.

- **Visibility toggle:** Hide sections from quiz takers while retaining their content.

- **Normalized scoring:** All results follow the same 0–100 percentage scale, ensuring consistency across all quizzes.

### **Hide or Delete Sections**

- Click the **eye icon** to toggle visibility on or off.

- Click the **trash icon** to permanently delete it.

- Hidden sections appear **grayed out** in the Section panel.

### **Configure Global Score Tiers**

Global Score Tiers define score ranges (Low, Medium, High) based on percentages, ensuring every quiz result is measured consistently. These tiers also enable workflow triggers and conditional automations.

**To configure score tiers:**

1. Click **Configure Score Tiers** in the top-right of the result page editor.

2. Set your score labels and percentage ranges.

3. Each range must fall between **0–100**.

4. Click **Save** to apply globally.


**Example:**

- Low: 0–39%

- Medium: 40–79%

- High: 80–100%


Configure Score Tiers to define Low/Medium/High scoring logic. Click Save, then Preview your quiz to verify flow and scoring.
