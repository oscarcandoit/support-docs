# **What is Notes Association in CRM?**

Notes Association lets you create and manage notes that are linked specifically to Contacts, Opportunities, or both. This gives your team better visibility and context when reviewing interactions, while avoiding clutter from unrelated information.

Rather than lumping all notes into a single view, you can now separate communication related to deals from general customer interactions. This feature introduces powerful flexibility without compromising searchability or access.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Notes Association**

Notes Association enhances the clarity and utility of CRM notes by allowing selective linking between contacts and opportunities.

    •    **Entity-Specific Notes** – Keep opportunity notes separate from contact notes for focused documentation.

    •    **Flexible Associations** – Link notes to contacts, opportunities, or both as needed.

    •    **Improved Organization** – Separate your deal-related notes from general customer conversations.

    •    **Smart Filtering** – Quickly narrow down notes by entity type for faster access.

    •    **Enhanced Searchability** – Use powerful search to locate notes across entities instantly.

* * *

## **How to Enable Notes Association (Opportunity Notes Feature)**

Before using this feature, you’ll need to activate it within the Labs area of your subaccount settings.

**Steps to enable:**

    1\.    Navigate to your **Subaccount**.

    2\.    Click on **Settings** in the left-hand navigation.

    3\.    Go to the **Labs** tab.

    4\.    Toggle ON the feature labeled **Opportunity Notes**.

* * *

## **How to Create Entity-Specific Notes**

Creating notes with specific associations allows you to keep your records clean and relevant to the context in which you’re working.

**Steps to create a new note:**

    1\.    Go to either a **Contact** or an **Opportunity** record.

    2\.    Click on the **Notes** tab.

    3\.    Click **\+ Add Note**.

    4\.    Write your note as you normally would.

    5\.    Use the **Associate With** dropdown to choose one of the following:

    •    **Contact**

    •    **Opportunity**

    •    **Both**

    6\.    Click **Save** to store the note.

* * *

## **How to Filter Notes by Associations**

Quickly zero in on the most relevant notes using the new filtering capabilities.

**How to filter:**

    1\.    Navigate to the **Notes** tab under a contact or opportunity.

    2\.    Click the **Filter** icon.

    3\.    Choose your view:

    •    **All Notes**

    •    **Contact-only Notes**

    •    **Opportunity-only Notes**

    •    **Notes associated with both**

Filtering helps you focus only on what’s relevant to your current workflow.

* * *

## **How to View Notes by Entity**

Keep your work streamlined by viewing notes within the right context—either from the contact or the opportunity side.

**Where to view:**

    •    **Contacts View** – See notes directly linked to the contact, as well as any shared opportunity notes.

    •    **Opportunities View** – View only those notes that are associated with that specific opportunity.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will old notes be affected by this change?**

No, all your existing notes remain unchanged. The new association options only apply to newly created notes.

**Q: Can I link a note to multiple opportunities or contacts?**

Currently, a note can only be linked to one contact and one opportunity at a time.

**Q: Is this available across all subaccounts?**

The feature is in Labs and must be enabled per subaccount in **Settings > Labs**.

**Q: Can I change the association after saving a note?**

Not yet. To reassign a note, you would need to duplicate it and associate it with the desired entity.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**

Mobile support is in development and will be released in a future update.

**Q: What happens when the opportunity or contact is deleted?**

Notes are **only** deleted when all of their associated entities are permanently deleted. If there is at least one associated contact or opportunity which is not deleted - the note would not be deleted as well.

* * *

## **Next Steps**

    •    Head over to **Settings > Labs** in your subaccount and activate the **Opportunity Notes** feature.

    •    Train your team on how to associate notes based on context.

    •    Review your existing note-taking strategy and decide when to separate contact vs opportunity notes.

    •    Use smart filters and note search to organize your CRM workflows more efficiently.
