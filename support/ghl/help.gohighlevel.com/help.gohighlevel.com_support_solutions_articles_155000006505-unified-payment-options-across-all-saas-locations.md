# **Overview of Unified Payment Options**

Unified Payment Options standardizes and enhances payment choices across SaaS V1 and V2 so both agency and location users see a consistent, role‑based checkout with wallet and card support at every SaaS location. Unified Payment Options aligns the payment flow across versions. All SaaS locations will now support wallet and card-based payments, ensuring consistency and flexibility

Agency users have access to **Pay using Card**, **Pay using Wallet**, and **Pay using Agency Card.**

Location users have access to **Pay using Card** and **Pay using Wallet**.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Unified Payment Options**

- **Aligned Experience:** Checkout flows are consistent across SaaS V1 and V2.

- **Clear Role Visibility:** Agency and location users see only the options intended for them.

- **Wallet Availability:** Wallet payments are enabled across all SaaS locations.

- **Removed Inconsistencies:** Prior differences between V1 and V2 payment methods were resolved for a smoother experience.

* * *

## **Payment Methods Overview**

A quick look at how each payment option:

- **Pay using Card:** Charges the primary card stored under **Settings** → **Billing**.

- **Pay using Wallet:** Deducts from pre-loaded credits; auto-reload triggers when the balance falls below your threshold.

- **Pay using Agency Card:** Only visible to agency-level users; HighLevel bills the agency’s card on file.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can my client accidentally use the Agency Card?**

No. Location users never see the Agency Card button; they only see their own wallet and card options.

**Q: How do I adjust my wallet’s auto-reload threshold?**

Go to **Settings → Billing → Wallets & Transactions → Auto-Recharge**.

**Q: Is the Agency Card charge ever shown to my client?**

No. Charges routed to the Agency Card do not appear on location invoices.

**Q: Do I need to migrate anything to see the new checkout?**

No. Payment flows are aligned across SaaS V1 and V2 automatically.
