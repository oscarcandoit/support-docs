10. Add media files using your camera, gallery, or files app of your device.
11. You can also assign a category and a tag to the post you are creating.
12. Once your post is ready to be published, tap on Post on the top right of the screen.
13. You can choose to post immediately, schedule the post to go out at a later date and time, save as draft to come back and continue editing, or schedule it as a recurring post to be sent out at a defined frequency.
14. After selecting your preferred posting method, your will return to the homepage and see the published/scheduled/draft post on your timeline.
15. Once the post has been published successfully, you will be able to tap on the redirect button available on the social post card to open up the social media app and see your published post.
