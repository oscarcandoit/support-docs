## What is the Guided Review Setup Wizard?

The Guided Review Setup Wizard is a step-by-step onboarding assistant available exclusively within newly created sub-accounts on the Reputation Management Overview page. It appears only when initial review setup has not been completed and disappears once all setup tasks are finished.

The wizard simplifies the setup experience by guiding users through six essential actions, each designed to prepare the account for active review management and response automation.

Key Benefits of the Guided Review Setup Wizard

The wizard helps eliminate the complexity often associated with initial configuration, ensuring users start collecting and managing reviews without delay.

- Provides a clear, structured onboarding process

- Automatically hides upon full setup completion, minimizing dashboard clutter

- Encourages early activation of Reviews AI and other advanced features

- Helps new users send their first review request quickly

- Increases adoption of widgets and integrations that enhance review visibility

- Reduces support dependency during onboarding


## How To Use the Guided Review Setup Wizard

The wizard automatically appears on the Reputation Management Overview screen for newly created sub-accounts that have not yet configured reviews. It includes six guided steps that walk users through the full setup journey. Once all steps are complete, the wizard disappears and will not reappear.

## Step 1 – Connect GBP or Facebook Pages

Connecting your Google Business Profile or Facebook Page is the first step toward collecting reviews from these platforms. This connection enables review data to be pulled directly into the system.

- Click on "Connect Review Platforms" within the wizard

- You will be redirected to the Integrations page

- Select either Google or Facebook and follow the connection prompts


## Step 2 – Setup Review Link

A custom review link allows you to request feedback from customers directly. This step ensures that the link is active and ready for use in messages or widgets.

- The wizard redirects to Settings → Review Link

- Customize or confirm your default review link

- Copy this link for use in review request workflows


## Step 3 – Send First Review Request

This step encourages users to begin engaging with customers by sending an initial review request.

- The wizard navigates to the Review Requests page

- Choose a contact or enter recipient information manually

- Send the review request via SMS or email


## Step 4 – Configure Reviews AI

Enabling Reviews AI allows the system to generate and publish automated responses to customer reviews, improving responsiveness and consistency.

- The wizard guides you to Settings → Reviews AI

- Toggle the AI response feature to “On”

- Select the desired tone and response behavior


## Step 5 – Create Review Widget

Review widgets display your positive reviews on your website to build trust with potential customers.

- The wizard takes you to the Widgets tab

- Choose from available widget styles (carousel, grid, list)

- Copy and embed the widget code into your website's HTML


## Step 6 – Connect More Review Platforms

After setting up your initial source, the wizard encourages users to explore additional platforms to maximize review collection opportunities.

- You will be directed back to the Integrations page

- Connect other available platforms such as Yelp or TripAdvisor, if applicable


## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why don’t I see the Review Setup Wizard in my account?

The wizard only appears for newly created sub-accounts. If your account is older or already has reviews configured, the wizard will not be shown.

Q: Can I reopen the wizard after it disappears?

No. Once all setup steps are completed, the wizard will automatically disappear and cannot be reopened. You can still access all setup areas manually.

Q: Is it necessary to enable Reviews AI?

No. Reviews AI is optional, but enabling it can streamline review response management by automating replies based on your preferences.

Q: Will existing reviews or data be affected by the wizard?

No. The wizard only guides you through setup and does not modify any existing reviews or data.

Q: What platforms can I connect for review collection?

Google Business Profile and Facebook are currently supported, with additional platforms available depending on region and account type.
