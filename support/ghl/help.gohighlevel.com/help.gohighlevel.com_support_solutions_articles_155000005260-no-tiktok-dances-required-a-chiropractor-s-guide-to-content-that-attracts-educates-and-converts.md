# No TikTok Dances Required: A Chiropractor’s Guide to Content That Attracts, Educates, and Converts

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 5:58 AM

You don’t need to go viral to win new patients. You just need to be visible, trustworthy, and consistent.

In today’s world, content is how people get to know you _before_ they ever call your clinic. It’s what shows up when they Google you, scroll Instagram, or check reviews. If you’re not posting, sharing, or showing up regularly, you’re essentially invisible.

This playbook gives you a repeatable, chiropractor-friendly content strategy that builds local awareness, drives more bookings, and keeps you top-of-mind — even when your schedule is full.

### **The Three Pillars of a Winning Chiropractic Content Strategy**

1. **Visibility**: Can people find you when they search or scroll?

2. **Trust**: Do they believe you know your stuff and care about outcomes?

3. **Action**: Do your posts guide them toward booking or engaging with you?


Every piece of content should hit at least one of these — ideally two.

* * *

### **What Chiropractors Should Be Posting — and Why**

| Content Type | Purpose | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Educational Posts | Build authority and answer common questions | 2–3x/week |
| Testimonials or Reviews | Build trust and social proof | 1–2x/week |
| Behind-the-Scenes or Day-in-the-Life | Humanize the practice | 1x/week |
| Seasonal Tips or Promos | Drive timely bookings | 2x/month |
| Video Demos (adjustments, posture tips) | Boost engagement | 1–2x/week |
| Stories/Quick Tips | Stay top-of-mind | Daily or as often as possible |

Don’t overthink the format — short posts, quick videos, or even a single image with a thoughtful caption can go a long way.

* * *

### **10 Plug-and-Play Content Prompts for Chiropractors**

01. “The one stretch I give every patient with lower back pain.”

02. “3 things your spine wishes you’d stop doing at work.”

03. “Here’s what really happens during your first adjustment.”

04. “This posture check takes 5 seconds. Stand up and try it.”

05. “Before and after (with consent): What 4 sessions can do.”

06. “It’s rainy/cold/hot out — here’s why your joints feel it.”

07. “A quick message to our returning patients (we see you).”

08. “Our favorite way to reset your back in 3 minutes.”

09. “Meet our front desk — the real boss of this place.”

10. “Just had this conversation with a patient, and it might help you too.”

### **Use GHL to Create, Schedule, and Automate Your Content Flow**

GoHighLevel makes content execution easy — even if you’re not a social media person.

#### **1\. Plan and Schedule Posts Ahead of Time**

Use the **Social Planner** to:

- Map out content across Facebook, Instagram, Google Business, and LinkedIn

- Create recurring post templates (like weekly tips or testimonials)

- Bulk schedule an entire month’s worth of content in under an hour


#### **2\. Use Content AI to Write Captions and Hooks for You**

GHL’s **Content AI** lets you:

- Generate post captions, headlines, hashtags, and hooks in seconds

- Repurpose a blog into carousel captions

- Write email copy or Google Business post text instantly


You can also tell Content AI who your audience is (“local patients in back pain”) and let it write tailored messaging that sounds like your brand.

#### **3\. Monitor Engagement From One Dashboard**

Inside GHL’s **Social Planner**, you can:

- Respond to DMs and comments without switching platforms

- Track which posts get the most clicks, engagement, or responses

- Optimize future content based on real data


You don’t need another tool. It’s already in your system.

* * *

### **Formats That Work — Even If You’re Not a Content Creator**

You don’t need a ring light and full editing suite. Keep it simple:

- **Selfie videos**: 30–60 seconds, direct to camera

- **Carousel posts**: Use tools like Canva to make 3–5 slide mini-education series

- **Photo + caption**: Image of your space or staff, paired with a relevant insight

- **Email newsletters**: Use 1–2 of the weekly posts and turn them into a monthly clinic update

- **Text blasts**: Promote a piece of content via SMS to your list — “Back pain flaring up this winter? Try this tip we just shared.”

### **Platforms That Matter (And What to Use Them For)**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Use Case |
| Google Business Profile | Post weekly tips, updates, and promos for local SEO |
| Instagram | Visual storytelling, reels, community engagement |
| Facebook | Reviews, longer form posts, community connection |
| YouTube Shorts | Short video tips, posture demos, education |
| Email | Long-form authority, nurture, reactivation |
| SMS | Short, high-conversion reminders and links |

* * *

### **Monthly Content Calendar Template**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week | Focus Theme | Example Posts |
| Week 1 | Common Conditions | “What we do for tech neck” + quiz link |
| Week 2 | Behind-the-Scenes | Clinic tour video + team shoutout |
| Week 3 | Testimonials & Proof | Screenshot review + before/after + caption |
| Week 4 | Educational Series | 3-slide posture myth busting + reel |

Repeat this monthly. Adapt it to your seasonal calendar. The goal is consistency, not perfection.

* * *

### **Final Word**

You don’t need to entertain — you need to educate, relate, and remind. When you show up consistently with helpful, local, relevant content, your community starts to see you not just as a provider, but as the go-to expert.

It’s not about algorithms. It’s about presence.

Next up: We’ll walk through operational automations that save hours each week and keep your front desk team from burning out.
