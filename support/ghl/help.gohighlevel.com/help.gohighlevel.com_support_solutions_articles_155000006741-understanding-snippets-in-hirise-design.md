# **What is the HiRise Snippets Page?**

The **HiRise Snippets** page is the redesigned home for all your text and email Snippets inside the **Conversations** module. Built on HighLevel’s HiRise design system, it replaces the classic list view with a faster, modern layout that improves visibility, performance, and collaboration through URL-based filters and pagination memory.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the HiRise Snippets Page**

- Modern HiRise interface improves readability and reduces visual clutter.

- Faster loading ensures large Snippet libraries open almost instantly.

- Shared URLs preserve search terms, page number, and rows-per-page, so teammates see the identical view.

- Responsive layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes.

- Consistent HiRise navigation aligns Snippets with other upgraded modules for a unified experience.

* * *

## **HiRise Navigation & Layout**

The redesigned Snippets page centers your list view with a clear, single-table layout. Filters, search, and bulk actions are grouped in an intuitive header bar, while the **New Folder** and **\+ New Snippet** buttons are placed on the top-right for quick access. Context menus open as side panels, allowing you to edit Snippets without losing your position in the list.

* * *

## **How to Use the HiRise Snippets Page**

The HiRise Snippets upgrade is automatically enabled for all accounts—no setup required.

### **Open Snippets Page**

From the left-hand navigation, click **Conversations**, then select the **Snippets** tab at the top of the page. This takes you to the Snippets dashboard, where you can view, create, and organize prewritten messages for quick use in conversations.

### **Search Snippets**

Use the **Search** bar on the right side of the Snippets page to quickly locate a specific snippet by name or keyword. As you type, the list filters automatically, displaying only the snippets that match your search term.

### **Create New Snippet**

Click the **\+ New Snippet** button in the top-right corner and choose between **Add Text Snippet** or **Add Email Snippet**. This opens a new window where you can compose and save reusable content for faster and more consistent communication.

### **Create New Folder**

Click the **New Folder** button in the top-right corner to organize your Snippets by category or purpose. This helps you group related messages—like sales follow-ups or support replies—making it easier to locate and manage Snippets efficiently.

### **Manage Existing Snippets**

Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** beside any Snippet to view management options such as **Move to Folder**, **Edit Snippet**, **Duplicate Snippet**, or **Delete Snippet**. These quick actions let you organize, update, or remove Snippets without leaving the main list view.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to enable Labs or a beta toggle?**

No. The HiRise Snippets page is already live for all locations.

**Q: Did any Snippet functionality change?**

No. All create, edit, folder, and permission features remain the same. Only the design and performance have improved.

**Q: Can I revert to the old design?**

The classic layout has been retired to maintain consistency across the platform.

**Q: Will shared URLs break if Snippets are added or deleted later?**

No. The link saves your view preferences—search, filters, and pagination—so others will still see your filtered view.

**Q: Are Snippet permissions affected?**

Permissions are unchanged. Users still need **View & Manage Conversations** access to use Snippets.

**Q: Does the remembered URL work across sub-accounts?**

No. Shared URLs only function within the same sub-account. Users without access will see an authorization error.
