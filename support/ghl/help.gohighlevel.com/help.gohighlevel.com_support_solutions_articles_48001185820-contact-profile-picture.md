## **What is the Profile Picture Feature?**

The profile picture feature allows you to add a visual identifier (photo or logo) to a contact record in HighLevel. These images appear throughout the app wherever that contact engages — primarily in the **Contacts Smart List** and the **Conversations inbox**. Profile pictures can currently **only be added during contact creation** and **cannot be changed afterward**. However, once uploaded, they appear in various interface areas, helping teams instantly recognize who they’re engaging with.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Profile Pictures**

Profile images aren't just cosmetic, they bring practical advantages that improve user experience and communication workflows.

- Helps quickly identify contacts in both Contacts and Conversations views

- Adds a personalized feel to client interactions

- Reduces confusion when managing duplicate leads

- Provides a professional and visual interface for your team

- Simplifies user navigation by allowing at-a-glance recognition

- Enhances team productivity with faster context switching

* * *

## **Current Limitations of the Profile Picture Feature**

While helpful, this feature is still evolving and has the following limitations:

- You **cannot add, change, or update** a profile image after contact creation.

- Profile pictures **are not displayed** inside the full contact profile record/tab.

- No drag-and-drop or cropping tools are available for uploaded images.

- The feature is **not yet supported via API**.


* * *

## **How to Add Profile Pictures**

Profile pictures are added only **when new contacts are created**. There’s no way yet to update a profile picture after the contact is saved.

```
IMPORTANT: If you need to add a profile picture to an existing contact, you’ll need to create a new contact, add a profile picture to it and merge this new contact with the old contact.
```

To add a profile picture, navigate to the **Contacts** tab in the left-hand navigation and click the **➕ (plus)** button to add a new contact.

- In the **Contact creation window**, click the image area labeled **“Personal Logo”**.

- Upload an image file (max 2.5MB, 512x512px recommended).

- Fill in the contact details and click **Save**.

Once saved, the contact will now show the uploaded image in various parts of the platform.

```
IMPORTANT: Profile pictures cannot be edited later, make sure to upload the image during creation.
```

```
Note - Once created a new contact with the desired profile picture, you can merge the 2 contacts. For more refer to Merging Multiple Contacts
```

## **Viewing Profile Pictures in the Contacts Tab**

After creating the contact with a profile image, navigate back to the **Contacts** Smart List. You’ll now see the uploaded image appear next to the contact name. This makes it easier to visually scan and find leads based on their logos or profile pictures.

* * *

## **Viewing Profile Pictures in Conversations**

When a contact with an uploaded image sends a message or appears in a conversation thread, their image will show in the **left-hand conversation list** next to their name and the **right-side contact panel.** It does not appear in the conversations panel in the middle.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I update or change the profile picture later?**

Not at this time. Profile pictures can only be added when creating a new contact.

**Q: Where will the uploaded image appear?**

You’ll see it in the **Contacts Smart List**, **Conversation Inbox**, and **right-side contact panel**.

**Q: Can I add a picture to an existing contact?**

No. Currently, there’s no option to modify profile pictures on already created contacts.

**Q: What’s the ideal image size and format?**

Images should be **512x512 pixels** and **under 2.5MB** in JPG or PNG format.

**Q: Will this be editable in future releases?**

HighLevel is actively enhancing contact features, and future updates may support image editing.
