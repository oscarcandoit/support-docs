## **Overview**

The **Action Builder** for Voice AI has been completely redesigned to offer a cleaner, faster, and more intuitive experience. This update introduces a card-based layout, tabbed structure, and streamlined workflows, making it significantly easier to create, manage, and review what your agent does both during and after a call.

```
To enable this feature: Go to Settings > Labs > Enable "Voice AI - Separate During and Post Call Actions"
```

## **What’s New**

1. **Card-Based Interface**

Actions now appear as individual cards. You can easily scan, sort, and organize actions with improved visual clarity.

2. **Tabbed Layout**

The actions are now split into **During the Call** and **After the Call** sections. Each tab displays the total number of actions configured.

3. **Streamlined Creation Flow**

A bold and easy-to-access **“New Action”** button encourages quick and structured action creation.

4. **Individual Action Modals**

Every action type opens in a dedicated modal, eliminating the need to switch tabs or scroll through long forms.

5. **Quick Delete Option**

You can now delete actions directly from the action card menu, no need to open the editor.

## Key Improvements

1. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**

Action types are now easier to distinguish thanks to better labels and grouped layouts.

2. **Simplified Editing & Deletion**

Edit or remove actions in fewer clicks — right from the action card.

3. **Built-In Constraints & Smart Guidance**

   - **Visual counters** show you how many of each action type you're using.

   - **Tooltips and inline guidance** prevent misconfiguration:

     - Max **15 total actions** during a call

     - Only **1 appointment booking action** allowed

     - Up to **25 contact field update actions** after a call

## **How to Use?**

1. Open the **Voice AI agent** you want to edit, and then click on the agent goals. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046578309/original/LnlppK9UioCFblywgVW74xqac-R4-U82DA.png?1747169559)

2. Use the **“New Action”** button to begin.

3. Choose the type of action you want to configure, for example, call transfer.

4. A focused modal will appear — fill in the required details.
