## Overview

The **TikTok Form Submitted** trigger is designed to start a workflow whenever a form is submitted via TikTok. This can be particularly useful for capturing leads, collecting feedback, or gathering information from TikTok users, and then automating subsequent actions.

## Trigger Name

**TikTok Form Submit**

## Trigger Description

This trigger activates a workflow when a specific form on TikTok is submitted. You can specify which form submissions should trigger the workflow using filters, ensuring that only relevant submissions start the workflow.

## How to Configure

- **Choose a Workflow Trigger**: Select **TikTok Form Submitted** from the list of available triggers.

- **Workflow Trigger Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your trigger, such as "TikTok Lead Capture" or "TikTok Feedback Form."

- **Filters**: Use filters to specify which form submissions will activate the workflow. You can filter based on the form name to narrow down the trigger to specific forms.
