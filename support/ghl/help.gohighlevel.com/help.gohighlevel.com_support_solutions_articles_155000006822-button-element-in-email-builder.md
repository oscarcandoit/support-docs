## **What is the Button Element in Email Builder?**

The Button Element is a drag-and-drop block that lets you insert a fully customisable CTA button into your email layout. You can adjust its design, alignment, and link destination to fit your goals such as directing recipients to a landing page, product page, or event registration.

Buttons are essential for guiding user actions and improving click-through rates. With this element, you can style them to stand out while maintaining a consistent look across all devices.

> **Note:** Buttons are built using HTML and render reliably in most email clients. Always preview your design on both desktop and mobile to ensure proper display.

- Customise button text, colour, and size to match your design theme.
