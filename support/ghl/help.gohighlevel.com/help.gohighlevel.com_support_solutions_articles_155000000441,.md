## **Use cases:**

1. **Increased visibility:** Instagram Reels allow users to reach a wider audience. When you create a Reel, it has the potential to be featured on the Explore page, where people who don't follow you can discover your content. This exposure can help individuals, influencers, and businesses gain more visibility and attract new followers.

2. **Creative expression:** Reels offer a platform for users to showcase their creativity and talent. With various editing tools, effects, filters, and audio options, people can experiment and create engaging visually appealing short videos.

3. **Discoverability:** Instagram Reels' algorithm shows users content based on their interests, preferences, and engagement patterns. This means that if you consistently create engaging Reels, your content is more likely to be recommended to users likely to enjoy it. This can help individuals and brands increase their reach and attract more followers.

4. **Business promotion:** Reels also allow businesses to humanize their brand and connect with their audience more personally.

5. **Bite-sized content consumption:** Short-form content is popular in today's fast-paced digital environment due to its quick and easily consumable nature. Users can scroll through Reels quickly, making it a convenient way to discover and engage with content.

**Note:** Instagram APIs calculate caption length based on **URL-encoded characters**, which means some special characters and emojis may count as more than one character and hence, even if the character count is under the limit in our platform, it may fail in the native app due Meta's  **URL-encoded characters** Logic as character limit exceeded.

## **Supported Content for Instagram Reels**

- Suggested video size upto 1GB and for thumbnail is 8MB.
- Aspect Ratio - The dimension should be recommended of 9:16.
