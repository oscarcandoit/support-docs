# Nested URL Paths Support for Websites, Funnels, Ecomm & Webinars

Modified on: Tue, 22 Jul, 2025 at 10:52 AM

Clean, hierarchical URL Paths boost search visibility, simplify navigation, and help visitors understand where they are on your site. HighLevel supports nested (multi‑path) URL Paths across Funnels, Websites, E‑commerce, and Webinars. This article explains what nested URL paths are, why they matter, and how to implement them.

```
Please Note: This feature is currently in Beta and may receive further updates and refinements

# **What are Nested URL Paths?**

The Nested URL Paths feature allows you to create hierarchical URLs for your funnels, websites, and webinars using forward slashes (/) to represent site structure. You can use nested paths to define your content organization, making the URLs easier for people to understand and your SEO.

#### **Examples of Nested Paths:**

- _/resources/courses/sales-funnel_
- _/webinars/2025/summer-session_
- _/campaigns/holiday/blackfridayoffer_
- _/funnels/product-launch/step1_

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Nested URL Paths**

- **SEO Optimization:** Clean, hierarchical URLs improve site structure and SEO rankings by making your content easier for search engines to index and understand.

- **Improved User Experience:** Visitors will see intuitive, well-organized paths in the address bar, creating a more professional and navigable experience.

- **Flexible Editing:** You can create or edit pages and steps with multiple path segments. This is ideal for structuring complex sites, product catalogs, content sections, or multi-step funnels and webinars.

- **Accurate Sitemaps:** Your sitemaps will now reflect the correct nested paths, enabling better indexing and discovery by search engines like Google.

- **Cross‑Module Consistency:** Works in Funnels, Websites, E‑commerce, and Webinars.

## **Path Validation, Restrictions and Limitations**

Understanding system limits prevents errors and ensures clean URLs.

### **Reserved Paths**

Certain paths are reserved for system functionality and cannot be used. Attempting to use them will result in an error message.

- _/b/_— Reserved for blogs functionality

- _/c/_ — Reserved for categories

- _/product/_ — Reserved for product pages

- _/collections/_ — Reserved for collection pages

- _/post/_— Reserved for blog posts

- _/category/_ — Reserved for category pages

- _/author/_— Reserved for author pages

- _/tag/_— Reserved for tag pages

- _/store/account_ — Reserved for store account functionality

### **Maximum Depth**

Nested URLs supports up to 5 levels (e.g., _/level1/level2/level3/level4/level5_).

Every segment between slashes (/) counts as one level. Your main domain and any subdomain are not included in that count. If you attempt to exceed five levels, the builder blocks the save and shows the message: **"URL path is too deep. Maximum 5 levels allowed."**

* * *

## **How to Use Nested URL Paths**

1. Go to any funnel, website, e-commerce, or webinar page or step

2. Click Edit

3. Enter your desired nested URL path, using / to create hierarchical structure

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- **Avoid trailing slashes:** Use clean, canonical paths without a trailing slash (e.g., _/path/subpath_ instead of _/path/subpath/_)

- **Eliminate double slashes:** Ensure there are no duplicate slashes in your paths (e.g., _/path/subpath_ not _/path//subpath_

- **No empty segments:** Avoid leaving blank segments between slashes (e.g., use  _/category/item_, not _/category//item_)

- **Use descriptive, meaningful paths:** Clearly communicate the content and its hierarchy with readable, intuitive URLs (e.g., _/blog/seo-tips_ instead of _/b/123_)

- **Organize logically:** Structure paths in a way that makes sense to visitors and mirrors your site's navigation or content hierarchy

- **Optimize for SEO:** Well-nested, keyword-rich paths can boost search engine rankings by signaling clear content relationships

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: I used to see my slash converted to a hyphen. Why isn’t that happening now?**

Previously, entering a slash automatically converted it to a hyphen to create a flat path. With Nested URLs, slashes are preserved so you can maintain a true folder hierarchy.

**Q: Will changing a live URL break existing links?**

Yes, set up a 301 redirect from the old address to preserve SEO equity and avoid 404s.

**Q: Can I use uppercase letters or spaces?**

Stick to lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens for clean, crawl‑friendly slugs.

**Q: Can I include hyphens or numbers inside individual segments?**

Yes. Paths like _/blog/2025/july-updates_ or _/course/lesson-1_ are valid.

**Q: Can I mix nested and flat URLs within the same site or funnel?**

Yes. You can keep some pages at a single level (e.g., _/about_) and others nested (e.g., _/blog/topic/10-22_) within the same website or funnel.
