# **What Are Dashboard Permissions?**

Dashboards offer the following levels of permissions:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Level** | **Description** |
| FULL | Gives the person the ability to create, edit, share, and delete Dashboards |
| EDIT | Gives the person the ability to edit a dashboard and the widgets. The person isn't able to delete the dashboard. |
| VIEW | Gives the person read-only access to a Dashboard |
| NO ACCESS | Restricts access to the dashboard entirely |

Here are how different actions on dashboards work for different level of permissions

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **FULL** | **EDIT** | **VIEW** | **NO ACCESS** | **PRIVATE DASHBOARD** | **OWNER** |
| Manage Permissions | ﻿✅﻿ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |
| Delete Dashboard | ﻿✅﻿ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |
| Set as Default Dashboard | ﻿✅﻿ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |
| Edit Dashboard | ﻿✅﻿ | ✅ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |
| Clone Dashboard | ﻿✅﻿ | ✅ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |
| View Dashboard | ﻿✅﻿ | ✅﻿ | ✅ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |
| Duplicate to another Sub-Account (Only Agency Level) | ﻿✅﻿ | ✅ | ✅ | ﻿❌ | ﻿❌﻿ | ﻿✅﻿ |

```
Only dashboard Owners or roles with Full permission are able to edit a dashboard's permissions.
Agency Admins always have Full access to all non-private dashboards.
Only Account Admin or Agency roles with full access to a dashboard are able to set it as a default dashboard.
Only Agency roles are able to duplicate a dashboard to another subaccount.
```

## **Agency vs Account Views**

Permissions screen and options changes as per the role of the logged in user

### **Agency View Of Dashboard Permissions**

Agency Admins will always have full access to all dashboards except those marked private by their creator. In the Agency view, there are **three** roles with access settings: **Agency User,** Account Admin, and Account User.

### **Account View Of Dashboard Permissions**

In the Account view there are **two** roles with access settings: Account Admin and Account User.

## **Roles and Permissions Hierarchy**

Dashboard Permissions follow a clear hierarchy to ensure smooth management of access levels:

Agency Admins > Agency Users > Account Admins > Account Users.

Permissions for higher-level roles will override permissions for lower-level roles. Lower-level roles cannot posess higher permissions than higher-level roles.

For example, if a dashboard is set to Account Admin:Edit and Account User:Edit is changed to Account Admin:View, then Account User will be automatically changed to View as well.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if no permissions are set?**

By default, dashboards are visible to all users unless restricted.

**Q: What does "Only Assigned Data" restrict exactly?**

It filters dashboard widgets to only show data related to the user's assigned records (contacts, opportunities, etc.).

**Q: How do I remove a user or role from a dashboard?**

Re-open the permissions modal for the dashboard and uncheck the user or role.
