Modified on: Thu, 25 Sep, 2025 at 1:00 AM

This guide explains how to reorganize SaaS plans by changing their **category** or **plan level**.

* * *

### **Step 1: Open Edit Plan**

- Go to **SaaS Configurator → Plans**.

- Select the plan you want to edit.

### **Step 2: Update Category & Plan Level**

- Under **Category Settings**, click **Edit**.

- To **move to a new category**:

  - Select a category from the dropdown (only same-currency categories will appear).
- To **change the plan level**:

  - Adjust its hierarchy position within the category.
- Confirm your selection.

### **Step 3: Save & Review**

- Save changes.

- **Review the impacted plans** in the new category — features from the moved plan are inherited upwards, and the moved plan itself inherits from lower levels.

### Important Notes

- **Existing customers are not retroactively updated.** Their plans remain the same, but upgrade/downgrade paths will update.

- **Impact on features:**

  - Plans above inherit features from the moved plan.

  - Moved plan inherits features from plans below it.

```
Use this with care, as it may affect your pricing/positioning strategy.
