## **Editing Hidden Elements**

If you've accidentally hidden an element from both desktop and mobile views, you won’t be able to see or click it on the canvas—but you can still access and edit it using the Layers panel in the builder.

1. **Open the Layers Panel**



In the top left of the Funnel or Website Builder, click the **Layers** icon (stacked layers). This will open a list of all the elements in your section/page, including hidden ones.

2. **Find the Hidden Element**



Scroll through the list to locate the element you hid. It may appear dimmed or with an "eye" icon indicating it’s not visible on either view.

3. **Select the Element**



Click the element's name in the list to select it. The element will now be highlighted in the builder, and its settings panel will appear.

4. **Restore Visibility**



With the element selected, click the **visibility toggle (eye icon)** in the top bar to turn it back on for desktop and/or mobile.
