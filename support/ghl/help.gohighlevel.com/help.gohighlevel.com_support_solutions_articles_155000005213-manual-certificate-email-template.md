# What is the Manual Certificate Email Template Feature?

The Manual Certificate Email Template feature allows users to choose from existing email templates when sending certificates manually. Additionally, users can customize the subject line for these emails before sending. This ensures the communication is aligned with the event, audience, or branding requirements.

If a user does not select a template during this process, the system will default to the template configured in the client portal’s email settings.

## Key Benefits of Manual Certificate Email Templates

Choosing specific templates for manual certificate emails enhances clarity, branding, and engagement. This section highlights the main advantages of using this feature.

- Personalize certificate delivery with custom templates.

- Customize the subject line to align with the content or event.

- Maintain consistent branding across all communications.

- Reuse templates to save time and reduce manual editing.

- Avoid mistakes with a fallback default template when none is selected.


## How To Send a Manual Certificate With a Selected Email Template

Selecting a predefined email template when sending a certificate manually ensures the message is appropriate and professionally formatted. Follow the steps below to use this feature:

1. Navigate to the Certificates section within your HighLevel account.

2. Select the contact(s) for whom you wish to send a certificate.

3. Click Send Certificate.

4. In the email modal, locate the Email Template dropdown.

5. Select the desired email template from the list.

6. Modify the Email Subject field as needed.

7. Review the preview, then click Send.


## Default Behavior for Unselected Templates

Understanding the fallback behavior is important to ensure proper communication is maintained even when a template is not manually chosen.

When no template is selected during the manual certificate send process:

- The system will automatically apply the default email template.

- This default template is configured in the Client Portal Settings > Email Settings section.


## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I create custom templates specifically for certificate emails?

Yes. Navigate to your Email Templates settings and create a new template. These can be selected during the manual send process.

Q: Will the subject line update automatically based on the selected template?

No. The subject line remains editable and must be updated manually if needed.

Q: Is there an option to preview the template before sending the certificate?

Yes. Once a template is selected, a preview will appear within the send modal.

Q: What happens if I send the certificate without choosing a template or editing the subject line?

The default template and subject line from the client portal settings will be used.

Q: Can I set different default templates for different types of certificates?

Not at this time. Only one default template can be configured per account via the client portal settings.
