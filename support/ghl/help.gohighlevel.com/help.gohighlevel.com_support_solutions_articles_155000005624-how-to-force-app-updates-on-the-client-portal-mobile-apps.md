# **What is the Force App Update Feature?**

The Force App Update feature is designed to require users to update their mobile application to the latest version before they can continue using it. When a new version is released, users will receive a prompt directing them to update the app via the appropriate app store. This ensures that all users have access to the most recent features and security enhancements.

## **Key Benefits of the Force App Update Feature**

Implementing mandatory app updates offers several advantages that enhance both user experience and application integrity.

- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures all users operate on versions with the latest security patches.

- **Improved Performance**: Users benefit from performance optimizations included in the latest releases.

- **Feature Consistency**: Guarantees that all users have access to the newest features and improvements.

- **Reduced Support Issues**: Minimizes issues arising from outdated app versions, leading to fewer support requests.

- **Streamlined User Experience**: Provides a consistent experience across all devices and users.


## **How to Enable the Force App Update Feature**

Activating the Force App Update feature ensures that users cannot bypass critical updates, maintaining the app’s integrity and user trust.

1. **Access the Client Portal Settings**:

   - Navigate to the **Sites** section in your HighLevel dashboard.

   - Select **Client Portal**.

   - Click on **Settings**.
2. **Enable Force Update**:

   - Within the settings menu, locate the **Force App Update** option.

   - Toggle the switch to **Enable**.
3. **Specify Version Details**:

   - Enter the latest version number of your app.

   - Provide the direct download links for both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
4. **Save Changes**:

   - Click **Save** to apply the new settings.

## **User Experience Upon Enabling Force App Update**

Understanding the user journey post-implementation helps in anticipating user queries and ensuring a smooth transition.

- **Update Prompt**: Upon launching the app, users will see a prompt indicating that a new version is available.

- **Redirect to App Store**: Selecting the update option will redirect users to the appropriate app store to download the latest version.

- **Access Restriction**: Users will be unable to access the app’s features until the update is completed.

- **Seamless Transition**: Post-update, users can resume normal app usage with enhanced features and security.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can users skip the update prompt and continue using the app?**

A: No, once the Force App Update feature is enabled, users must update the app to the latest version to regain access.

**Q: How often should I update the app to necessitate a forced update?**

A: It’s recommended to enable forced updates for major releases that include critical fixes or significant feature enhancements.

**Q: Will enabling this feature affect users who already have the latest version?**

A: No, users on the latest version will not see the update prompt and can continue using the app uninterrupted.

**Q: Is there a way to notify users about upcoming mandatory updates?**

A: Yes, you can use the app’s notification system to inform users about upcoming updates and encourage them to update proactively.

### **Next Steps**

- **Implement Soft App Updates**: Consider enabling soft updates for non-critical enhancements to provide flexibility to users.
