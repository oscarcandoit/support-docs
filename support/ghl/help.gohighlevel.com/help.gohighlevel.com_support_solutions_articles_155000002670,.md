# **What is the Birthday Reminder Workflow Trigger?**

The Birthday Reminder Workflow Trigger is an automation tool that initiates workflows based on a contact’s stored birthdate. It runs daily at 8 AM (account time zone), scanning all contacts to check if anyone’s birthday matches the current date. If a match is found, the workflow is activated, allowing businesses to send birthday greetings, promotional discounts, or reminders. Users can customize the timing of messages using time delays or apply filters to trigger actions on a specific day before or after a contact’s birthday. This trigger eliminates the need for manual tracking and ensures timely engagement with customers.

### **Customize the Trigger**

The Birthday Reminder Workflow Trigger can be customized to control when and how it activates. By default, it triggers on the contact’s exact birthday at 8 AM, but filters allow you to modify the timing. This gives businesses more flexibility in delivering personalized birthday messages at the most strategic moments. You can set the workflow to fire before, after, or on a specific day/month to align with your campaign goals. For example, you can send a pre-birthday offer, a birthday greeting on the exact day, or a post-birthday follow-up to extend an exclusive discount. Below are the available filters that help refine the trigger timing.

- **After Number of Days:** This filter activates the workflow a specific number of days after the contact’s birthday. It is useful for sending post-birthday follow-ups, such as an extended discount offer or a feedback request after a customer’s special day.

- **Before Number of Days:** This filter activates the workflow a specific number of days before the contact’s birthday. It ensures timely engagement by allowing businesses to send pre-birthday reminders or special discounts, making customers feel valued before their big day.

- **Day Is:** This filter triggers the workflow on a specific day of the month, rather than directly on a contact’s birthday. This is helpful for businesses running batch birthday campaigns, where all customers with birthdays in a given period receive messages on a single day.

- **Month Is:** This filter activates the workflow based on the birth month rather than an exact day. It is commonly used for grouping contacts by birth month and sending exclusive birthday invitations, perks, or month-long offers to celebrate a larger customer segment at once.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can I send birthday messages a few days before or after the actual birthday?**

Yes, you can customize the timing using filters. For example, set the workflow to trigger 3 days before the birthday to send a pre-birthday discount or 1 day after to follow up with a special offer.

**Q. Will the workflow trigger if a contact’s birthdate is missing?**

No, the workflow will only trigger for contacts with a valid birthdate stored in their profile. If a contact’s birthdate field is empty or incorrectly formatted, they will be skipped.

**Q. Can I limit birthday messages to specific customer groups?**

Yes, you can apply filters to send birthday messages only to contacts with specific tags (e.g., VIP customers) or those meeting certain criteria, such as a minimum purchase history.

**Q. How can I ensure that birthday messages comply with GDPR and other data regulations?**

Ensure that customers have provided explicit consent to receive marketing communications. Offer an opt-out option in emails and SMS messages, and store consent records in your CRM.

**Q. What happens if multiple contacts have birthdays on the same day?**

The system processes all matching contacts daily at 8 AM, ensuring that each eligible contact receives their message without manual intervention.
