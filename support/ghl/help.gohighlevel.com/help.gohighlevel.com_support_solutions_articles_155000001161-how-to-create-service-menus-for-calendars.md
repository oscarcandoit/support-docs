# **What is a Service Menu?**

Service Menus allow you to list multiple services in one branded interface, enabling clients to book various appointments in a single flow. Each service connects to a separate Service Calendar, giving you full control over availability, staff assignment, pricing, and duration. This is especially useful for businesses that offer several services or work with multiple providers.

## **Key Benefits of Service Menus**

Service Menus reduce friction in the scheduling process while providing full flexibility in how services are presented and booked.

- **Centralized Booking Experience:** Consolidates all services into a single interface so clients can browse and book from one convenient location.

- **Optional Staff Selection:** Allows clients to choose their preferred provider when enabled, giving them more control over their appointment experience.

- **Organized Service Categorization:** Enables grouped service organization through Group Calendars, making it easier to manage and present related services.

- **Independent Calendar Configuration:** Each service is tied to its own calendar, allowing you to define custom settings, staff, availability, and duration.

- **Flexible Booking Options:** Lets clients book one or multiple services in a single session based on your configuration preferences.
