# **What is Live Chat?**

Live Chat inside Conversations is a powerful tool that allows businesses to engage with website visitors in real-time, providing instant support and fostering stronger customer relationships. Unlike traditional email or SMS-based communication, Live Chat ensures immediate responses, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction. Messages from the website chat widget are routed directly to the Conversations section, where users can manage interactions alongside other communication channels like SMS and email. This centralization helps streamline workflows, eliminating the need to switch between multiple platforms. Additionally, businesses can assign chats to specific team members, use automation to enhance efficiency, and configure fallback messages for unattended inquiries. With Live Chat, businesses can offer a seamless, interactive experience that keeps visitors engaged and increases conversion rates.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. How can I ensure that Live Chat messages appear inside the Conversations section?**

To receive Live Chat messages in Conversations, you must first install and enable the Chat Widget on your website. Additionally, make sure the Chat Type is set to Live Chat (instead of SMS/Email Chat) under Sites > Chat Widget. Without this setup, messages will not be routed to Conversations.

**Q. What happens if no one responds to a Live Chat message in real-time?**

If no agent responds within the Fallback Inactivity Time configured in the Chat Widget settings, an automated message will prompt the visitor to leave their contact details. This ensures that the conversation can continue later via email or SMS, even if live support is unavailable at the time.

**Q. Can Live Chat conversations be assigned to specific team members?**

Yes, Live Chat messages can be manually assigned or automatically routed to team members based on your workflow settings. This allows businesses to distribute incoming chats efficiently and ensure that the right person is handling each conversation.

**Q. Is it possible to filter and view only Live Chat conversations inside the Conversations section?**

Yes, you can use filtering option within the Conversations section that allows users to view only Live Chat messages. This makes it easier to manage real-time interactions separately from SMS, email, and other communication channels.
