# How to use the Sync Edit Checkbox for Email Actions in Workflows(Continuous Sync)

Modified on: Tue, 23 Sep, 2025 at 6:57 AM

The new Sync Changes feature gives you control over whether changes in your workflow’s email action should update the template or not. Enable or disable sync easily with a checkbox while selecting templates for email actions.

# **What’s New**

- # **What is Sync Edit Checkbox on Template Selection:**


  - When you create an email action and choose an existing template, a “Sync Edits to Template” checkbox now appears.

  - The "Sync Edits to Template" checkbox lets you control if changes in your workflow email and the linked template always update each other automatically. Turn it ON to keep them synced, or OFF to make them independent and editable separately.

- **Sync Possibilities: What Happens When Sync is ON or OFF**

- **When Sync is ON:**

  - Any changes you make in your workflow email will automatically update the original template, and changes to the template will update your workflow email as well.

  - This is bi-directional syncing—both the workflow action and the template always match.
- **When Sync is OFF:**

  - Changes you make in your workflow email do **not** affect the original template, and future changes to the template won’t impact your workflow.

  - The workflow email and template now have independent content and updates.
- # **Benefits**


  - **When Sync is ON:**
    - Changes in the workflow’s email or the original template will always update the other.
    - Keeps content perfectly aligned across templates and workflows.
    - Saves time by managing updates in one place.
  - **When Sync is OFF** **:**
    - Workflow email actions and their original templates are fully independent.
    - Customize emails for specific workflows without affecting other templates or actions.
    - Ideal when you want to ‘break away’ from a template for a particular use case.

# **How to Use**

- # When adding or editing an email action in a workflow, select a template.

- A “Sync Edits to Template” checkbox appears.
  - **If you check it (turn ON):**
    - A modal will confirm: changes in either the workflow or template update the other.
    - Click “Turn On Sync” to confirm, now all edits stay in sync.
    - Example: Edit your workflow email and the template updates; edit the template and your workflow email updates too.

- **If you leave it unchecked or turn OFF:**
  - A modal will explain your workflow email and template will not affect each other.
  - Click “Turn Off Sync” to confirm, now edits are independent.
  - Example: Changes in the workflow email don’t update the template, and template changes won’t update this workflow email.

- **Sync Changes Modal:**
  - This modal exist in the templates section to see which all email actions in workflows are connected to the template and whether they're syncing changes.
  - Access it via the kebab menu in the email builder under “Sync Changes.” in templates.
  - Inside the modal, you will see:
    - A list of all email actions linked to the template
    - The **Continuous Sync status** (enabled/disabled) for each action
  - Check box will be ticked for enabled email actions and unticked for disabled Email actions
  - User will be able to select the email action and will be able to Sync the Template content to Email action for one time for  email actions where continuous sync is disabled
  - Once the user clicks on ' _**Sync Once**'_ CTA, a success notification will pop on the screen.
  - User Will not be able to untick the checkbox for Email action where continuous sync is enabled from this modal.
