Modified on: Wed, 30 Apr, 2025 at 9:01 AM

Receipts are crucial in business transactions, providing customers with documented confirmation of their purchases. They serve as proof of payment and enable businesses and customers to keep accurate records. We understand the importance of efficient receipt management, so we're thrilled to introduce our latest feature: Automatic Receipts.

## **How to enable Sales Receipts**

With Automatic Receipts, businesses can send receipts to contacts for order form purchases effortlessly. This feature covers primary, bump, and upsell purchases on 1-step and 2-step order forms along with subscriptions, calendar appointment booking payments, and invoice payments. By automating the receipt process, we aim to simplify your workflow and enhance the overall customer experience.

## **How to customize your Sales Receipts**

We believe in giving you control over your receipts. HighLevel gives you total control over your receipts and provides several customization options to personalize your receipts:

- **Custom Title:** Customize your receipt's title to give it a personal touch that aligns with your brand.

- **Receipt Numbers:** We understand the importance of keeping records in order, so we offer you the ability to assign a prefix and initial number to your receipts. This simplifies the task of tracking and managing transactions.

- **Email Template:** [Customizing your email templates](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000087) when sending customer receipts is the perfect way to reflect your brand's identity. With this feature, you can design and adjust the content of the email according to your preference, creating a professional and consistent experience that your customers will appreciate.

## **Delivery of Receipts**

Automatic Receipts ensure a seamless delivery process. Receipts will be sent as downloadable PDF files attached to an email directly to the contact's email address. This convenient delivery method allows customers to access and save their receipts easily.

## **Leveraging Custom Templates**

We provide you with the flexibility to leverage custom templates for sending receipts. You can create personalized and branded templates with receipts using [custom values](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001161575) available within our [email builder](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000087). Craft visually appealing and professional receipts that align with your business's unique style.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:****Can I send sales receipts automatically for only certain types of payments?**

No, enabling sales receipts applies globally to all payments made through order forms, calendar bookings, and invoices. If you want selective receipt handling, you would need to disable automatic receipts and send them manually for specific payments.

**Q: **Can sales receipts include custom fields or personalized messages?****

Currently, sales receipts do not support adding custom fields or personalized messages beyond standard transaction details. However, you can customize the email template associated with the sales receipt to include a general message or branding elements.

**Q: **Are sales receipts sent immediately after a payment is processed?****

Yes, sales receipts are sent automatically to the customer as soon as the payment is successfully processed. However, delays may occur depending on email delivery factors outside of HighLevel's control, such as the recipient's email server.

**Q: **How can I verify if a sales receipt was successfully delivered to a customer?****

You can verify whether a sales receipt was successfully delivered by checking the Email Reporting section within your subaccount. To access it, navigate to Marketing > Emails > Email Reporting. Once there, you can use filters to search by the recipient’s email address or the subject line of the receipt email. The reporting dashboard will show the delivery status—such as whether the email was delivered, opened, or bounced—helping you confirm if your customer received the receipt.
