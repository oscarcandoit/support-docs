## **Applying Negative Values to Math Operations:**

Applying these constraints when performing Math Operations within workflows can be important based on the specific characteristics of monetary and numeric fields. Here are some examples of where these constraints could apply:

**Please Note:**

```
Negative values are not supported with Date or Current Date fields.
```

### **Monetary Field Constraints:**

**Use Case:** Calculating discounts for a product or service. If the discount applied results in a negative value, the system should update the final price to 0 instead of a negative number, ensuring customers do not get charged a negative amount.

**Solution:** When performing Math Operations on monetary fields, it's essential to ensure that any subtraction operation that could result in a negative value is checked with an If/Else condition. If the result is negative, update the monetary field to 0.

### **Numeric Field Constraints:**

**Use Case:** Calculating the net profit or loss for a business. In this case, the numeric field can store positive and negative values, representing profit or loss.

**Solution:** When performing Math Operations on numeric fields, one can directly add or subtract values without additional constraints, as negative values are allowed.

Using If/Else conditions and other actions to ensure the constraints are respected can benefit workflows. For example, if a Math Operation on a monetary field results in a negative value, an If/Else condition can be used to check the result and set the value to 0 if necessary, thus maintaining the constraint for monetary fields.
