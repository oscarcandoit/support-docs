# **What Are Conversation Filters?**

Conversation Filters are a powerful feature that helps users organize and streamline their communication workflow. By allowing you to categorize and locate conversations based on specific criteria such as message type, assignee, or date, filters make it easy to prioritize and manage interactions efficiently. They enable you to stay organized, respond promptly, and manage your communication channels with ease.

Filters help you quickly find specific conversations by:

- **Contact Engagement Score**

- **Assigned** (specific team member)

- **Follower Assignment**

- **Last Message Channel/Type/Direction** (e.g., inbound/outbound)

- **Last Outbound Message Type** (e.g., manual/automated)

- **Last Message Channel** (e.g., SMS, Email)

## **Sorting Conversations**

Sorting options allow you to arrange your conversations in a way that’s most convenient for you. There are multiple available sorting methods, ensuring you can always find what you’re looking for quickly.

You can sort conversations by date to quickly find the latest or oldest messages:

1. In the **Conversations** panel, click on the **Sort** dropdown menu.

2. Choose either **Newest to Oldest** or **Oldest to Newest**.

## **Starred Conversations**

Starred conversations are a simple yet effective way to highlight and revisit important messages, helping you keep track of high-priority interactions with ease.

Star important conversations to easily find them later:

1. In the **Conversations** panel, click the **Star** icon next to a conversation.

2. To unstar, click the **Star** icon again.

## **Managing Multiple Conversations**

Handling a high volume of conversations can be challenging, but with multiple "conversation actions", you can efficiently manage multiple conversations simultaneously, helping you maintain control and organization in a busy environment.

Managing multiple conversations at once is easy with these steps:

1. In the **Conversations** panel, select the conversations you want to manage (up to 100 at a time).

2. Choose from the following actions:

   - Mark as Read/Unread

   - Star/Unstar

   - Delete
