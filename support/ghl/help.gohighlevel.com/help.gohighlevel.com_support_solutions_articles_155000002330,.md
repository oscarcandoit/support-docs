- Video: video/mp4, 16MB

## **Q: What are WhatsApp Media Templates?**

They are pre-approved message formats that allow you to include images, videos, documents, or location information within WhatsApp messages. They help streamline communication with customers, especially for marketing, support, or authentication purposes.

## **Q: What happens if I try to use media that doesn't fit the guidelines?**

You'll likely encounter an error message, and your template may not be sent. Ensure your media adheres to [WhatsApps Template Guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/)

## **Q: Do I need approval before using WhatsApp message templates?**

Yes, all templates must go through an approval process with WhatsApp (Meta) to ensure they meet specific guidelines.

## **Q: What factors can lead to a template being rejected?**

Common reasons for rejection include:

- Missing or incorrect variable formatting
- Content violating [WhatsApp's Business or Commerce policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/policy-enforcement/violations/)
- Sensitive information requests (e.g., full payment card numbers)
- Abusive or threatening language
- Duplicating an existing template
