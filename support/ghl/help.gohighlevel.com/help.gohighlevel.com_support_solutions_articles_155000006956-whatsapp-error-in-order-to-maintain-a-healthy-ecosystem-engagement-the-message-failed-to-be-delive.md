# WhatsApp Error: "In order to maintain a healthy ecosystem engagement, the message failed to be delivered"

Modified on: Wed, 12 Nov, 2025 at 9:47 PM

If you’re seeing the error message:

> **"In order to maintain a healthy ecosystem engagement, the message failed to be delivered"**
>
> it means that Meta (WhatsApp) blocked the message delivery to help maintain a positive messaging experience for users.

This error is part of Meta’s ongoing effort to protect users from receiving too many marketing or unsolicited messages and to ensure that people only receive messages they are likely to engage with.

* * *

### **Why This Happens**

Meta uses automated systems to evaluate engagement quality and user feedback before delivering messages.

The delivery can fail due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. **User engagement limits reached** – The recipient has already received several marketing messages from businesses recently. WhatsApp temporarily stops new marketing messages to prevent overload.

2. **Low engagement history** – If your messages have low open/read/reply rates, WhatsApp may limit further deliveries until engagement improves.

3. **High block or report rates** – If many users block or mark your business messages as spam, message delivery may be restricted.

4. **Message type or frequency** – Sending too many marketing messages in a short period, or using the same template repeatedly, can trigger this limit.

5. **User preference and sentiment signals** – Meta uses engagement signals to identify if users are not interested in marketing content from a particular business.


* * *

### How to Resolve & Prevent This Issue

**1\. Improve Message Engagement**

- Send personalized and relevant content.

- Use interactive messages (buttons, quick replies, catalogs, etc.).

- Avoid sending frequent repetitive marketing messages.


**2\. Recheck Message Type**

- Use **Utility** or **Authentication** templates for transactional updates.

- Avoid sending marketing or promotional content through these template types.


**3\. Space Out Marketing Messages**

- Limit how often you message the same user. Allow at least a few days between campaigns.


**4\. Build Trust and Consent**

- Always message users who have opted in to receive updates.

- Ensure your opt-in process clearly explains what type of messages they’ll receive.


**5\. Monitor Performance**

- Track delivery, read, and engagement rates.

- Remove inactive users from your broadcast lists to avoid poor engagement signals.


* * *

### **Recommended Action**

If this error persists:

- Try sending a **different template** (non-marketing type).

- Check your overall **marketing template performance and engagement metrics** in WhatsApp Manager.

- If you believe your messages are being incorrectly blocked, you can raise a support request via **Meta Business Support**.
