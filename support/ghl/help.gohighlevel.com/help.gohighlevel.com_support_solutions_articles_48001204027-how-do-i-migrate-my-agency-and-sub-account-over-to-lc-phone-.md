# How do I migrate my agency and sub-account over to LC Phone?

Modified on: Tue, 27 Aug, 2024 at 11:14 AM

```
Effective 19th October , the LC - Phone system will be available for all the agencies. You can skip the hassle and directly set up the system with one click.
```

# **Why LC-Phone?**

LC - Phone eliminates the need to integrate a third-party Telephony provider (Twilio, Plivo, etc.) in order to send/receive an SMS/Call in the CRM.

With LC - Phone, sending & receiving SMS/Calls in the CRM works right out of the box! Read more about it [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223546).

```

## **Step 1 -** Validate the LC - Phone System Access

**Step 2 -** Convert your agency to ISV

1. Click on Switch to LeadConnector Phone System
2. Read the general information and acknowledge the prompt by selecting the I accept checkbox.
1. **A2P registration will need to be redone and will not migrate over.**
      **This means that you will need to re-register for A2P again and pay the $4.95 charge if you already have A2P registered in your own Twilio account.**
3. Hit Confirm.
4. Wow!! You are on LC - Phone System now. You should get a success message.

**Note:**

```
Switching your agency account to LC will create all new sub-accounts under the LeadConnector phone service from that time forward. Once the new sub-accounts (in the future) are taken care of, agencies can start moving their existing sub-accounts over from Step 3.
```

## **Step 3 -** Move existing sub-accounts over to LC Phone

### **Some important points to look at before migrating the sub-account:**

1. Migrating all sub-accounts to LC Phone can only be used once.
2. Migrating all sub-accounts will only migrate sub-accounts with the country as US/Canada.
3. Each Sub-accounts can be migrated separately; a Switch to LeadConnector button will also be available.
4. For migrating a non-US/Canada sub-account, you must create a Regulatory Bundle and then request the number migration.

1. Click on Switch all sub-accounts to LC.
2. Read the general information and acknowledge the prompt by selecting the I accept checkbox.
3. Hit Confirm.
4. All the accounts will be moved to processing.

**You do not need to do anything during this phase. Your old sub-account will continue to work normally.** We will automatically detect when phone numbers are moved and switch to the new sub-account automatically.

**Note:**

```
This action will only migrate US/Canada sub-accounts, so the process will take 2-3 business days to complete. If it takes more time, please raise a support ticket.
```

Once this is done, your screen will look like this:![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48289796170/original/2Ff-bWlvkVxSS81yn9LKWkB4-iyhHSrCdw.gif?1680023971)

#### **11\. If a client switches from Twilio to LC, will call recordings for subaccounts be lost?**

Please note that the prompt before switching states, “Call recordings might get lost,” but rest assured that the recordings will still be archived in your Twilio account. the call recordings will not transfer over.
