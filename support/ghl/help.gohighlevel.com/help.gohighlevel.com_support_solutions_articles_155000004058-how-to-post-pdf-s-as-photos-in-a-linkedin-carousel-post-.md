# How to post PDF's as photos in a LinkedIn carousel post?

Modified on: Wed, 23 Oct, 2024 at 1:22 AM

Social Planner now offers a powerful new feature: users can upload PDF's and post them as photos in a carousel on LinkedIn. Additionally, users can import PDFs and convert each page into separate images for posting on LinkedIn and other social platforms.

The LinkedIn PDF Carousel has become one of the most popular formats for sharing information, providing a unique way to engage your audience and showcase expertise.

1. Navigate to Marketing > Social Planner
2. Connect your LinkedIn account (either a page or profile)
3. Click "New Post" and use the post composer to create a new LinkedIn carousel or document post
4. Select the socials from the dropdown and add your post content
5. Click on the file upload icon (located between the image and video upload icons)

    6\. Upload one or more PDFs for LinkedIn carousel or import photos to post as a PDF on LinkedIn

    7\. You can change the name of the PDF, add a watermark as needed

**Constraints to note:**

1. LinkedIn allows up to 300 pages and a 100 MB limit per document.
2. PDFs are converted into images when imported in social planner, and if Instagram is selected, the images are automatically cropped to adhere to Instagram's aspect ratio constraints.
3. Users can now delete media by clicking the 'X' that appears when hovering over the media preview.
4. When user selects post as a PDF option, all the images are converted into a PDF and posted to LinkedIn.

Hope this information help answer your queries!
