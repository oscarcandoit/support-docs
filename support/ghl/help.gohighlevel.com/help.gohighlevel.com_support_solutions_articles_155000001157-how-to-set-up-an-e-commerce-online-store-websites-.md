# What is an Online Store?

An online store is a virtual platform that allows businesses to sell products or services to customers globally. It enables customers to browse, select, and purchase items from the comfort of their own homes using a computer or mobile device.

**Importance of an Online Store**

1. **Global Reach**: Reach customers worldwide, expanding your market beyond geographical limitations.
2. **Convenience**: Customers can shop anytime, anywhere, increasing accessibility and convenience.
3. **Reduced Overheads**: Eliminate costs associated with physical storefronts and gain flexibility in operations.
4. **Automated Transactions**: Streamline the sales process with automated payment processing and order management.

# Setting Up Your e-Commerce Store

Let's walk through the steps of setting up and using your own e-commerce Online Store in HighLevel.

## **1\. Create and configure products to display in the Online store**

Businesses will be able to create and configure store products under Payments -> Products. This will allow configuring Product names, and descriptions, attaching product images and videos, defining the pricing, and configuring variants, if any.

Business users will be able to make use of the toggle at the top while creating a product to define the products that are to be displayed in the online store.

Additionally, businesses will now be able to have 3 core functionalities required for presenting products/services in their online store

1. Enable rich text description
    \- Businesses will be able to provide a rich text description for the products they are offering, including formatting, alignment, Bold, and Italics for emphasis on a few aspects, bulleted lists, or table elements. This description for the product will auto-populate on the Product details page
2. Attach multiple images/videos for products
    \- Displaying appropriate images and videos for products is a crucial part of your e-commerce store. Businesses will be able to attach multiple images and videos to products
3. Create variants for products
    \- Businesses will now be able to add variants like Size/Color/Material etc. for the products they configure. This will allow selling different variant options for the same product along with their customized prices

When an online store is added to a website, 5 pages are added by default to the website which will form the building blocks for your store. Businesses will be able to add any other kind of elements around the store elements that will help them in giving an overall customized experience to their customers that suits their brand needs
