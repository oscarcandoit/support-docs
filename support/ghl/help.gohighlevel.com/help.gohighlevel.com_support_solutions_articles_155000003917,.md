### **What Is Subaccount View?**

**Subaccount View** refers to how a subaccount user sees the template library when building emails, funnels, forms, etc. Admins can control the content shown to each subaccount by customizing the available templates and categories. This ensures that users only have access to the templates relevant to their needs and plan.

### **When to Use It:**

1. Different Niches: Enable only relevant templates for subaccounts in specific industries.
2. Irrelevant Categories: Hide unnecessary categories for certain subaccounts.
3. Restricted Access: Disable access to specific templates for select subaccounts.
4. Premium Templates: Offer exclusive templates for higher-tier plans.
5. SaaS Plans: Customize categories based on different SaaS plan levels.

### **How to Customize Template Access:**

1. Go to Template Library Admin and open the Settings.
2. Select Customize for Subaccounts.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034987049/original/_qMX-5bX4JEXJrL5r2lLSJvBo3DuqSGTnw.png?1729265339)
3. Locate the sub-account and click Edit.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034987118/original/W9Yv9glIIBeGM47Zla4GlLytwnXxSSXLKQ.png?1729265385)
4. Hide or Show categories or templates as needed.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034987103/original/V465CK40H6Xmy0HrqUYqcZm2rP3_1pjOJA.png?1729265371)
5. Click Save to apply changes.

This feature allows you to control template access and ensure subaccounts only see relevant resources based on their needs and plan.
