# Email Failure: Insufficient Permission for 2-Way Sync

Modified on: Mon, 18 Aug, 2025 at 3:19 AM

If you are seeing an email error that says **insufficient permission**, it means Gmail is blocking email sending due to missing or revoked permissions.

This usually happens in the following scenarios:

1. **Password Changed** – Your email password was changed after the integration was set up.

2. **Access Revoked** – The LeadConnector app’s access was disconnected from your Gmail account settings.

3. **Incomplete Permission Granted** – At the time of integration, all required permissions (scopes) were not selected when authorizing Gmail access.

* * *

## **How to Fix This**

### Step 1: Reconnect 2-Way Sync

- Clear your browser **cache and cookies**.

- Go to **Settings → Email → 2-Way Sync**.

- Reconnect your Gmail account and make sure all permissions requested are granted.


### Step 2: Remove & Reconnect (if issue persists)

If the error still occurs:

1. Go to your **Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access**.

2. Remove the **LeadConnector app**.

3. Return to your LeadConnector account and re-connect Gmail for 2-way sync.


This will refresh the connection and resolve insufficient permission issues.

## **Important Notes**

- Always grant **all requested permissions** during integration.

- If your password changes, you will need to reconnect the integration.

- Ensure the connected Gmail account has the necessary sending/receiving permissions.
