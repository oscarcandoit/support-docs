## **What are Keyboard Shortcuts in Advanced Builder?**

Keyboard shortcuts are built-in key combinations that trigger common builder commands—cut, copy, paste, zoom, save, and more—without ever touching your mouse. When you press K (or click the keyboard-icon pill) the shortcuts overlay appears, grouped into Easy-to-scan tabs so you can learn and reference commands in seconds. ⌘ represents the Command key on macOS, while Ctrl is used on Windows and Linux.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Keyboard Shortcuts**

- Finish complex builds up to 50 % faster by eliminating repetitive clicks.

- Copy or cut entire branches, including downstream actions—in one keystroke.

- Fly around the canvas with arrow keys and instant zoom/focus controls.

- Reduce strain and increase accessibility for power users who prefer the keyboard.

- Learn faster Commands are grouped into Essential, Edit, View, Navigation, and Tools tabs inside the overlay.

* * *

## **Where to find these keyboard shortcuts**

Open any workflow in **Advanced Builder**. Click the **Keyboard Shortcuts** button in the upper-left (or press **K**) to open the overlay.

The overlay groups commands into tabs: **Essential, Edit, View, Navigation, Tools**.

## **Important Notes & Limitations**

- **Availability:** Advanced Builder at launch. Coming soon for the standard builder.

- **Selection matters:** Some shortcuts act on the **currently selected node(s)**—select before using.

- **OS & layout:** Keys may vary slightly by operating system and keyboard layout.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do shortcuts work in the Standard Builder?**

At launch they’re exclusive to Advanced Builder, but Standard Builder support is on the roadmap.

**Q: Why do some keys feel different on my keyboard?**

Physical layouts (e.g., AZERTY) or OS-level key mappings can shift symbol locations. Use the on-screen overlay to confirm the actual character your keyboard sends.

**Q: Will shortcuts overwrite browser defaults?**

Only when the Builder canvas is focused. Global browser shortcuts like ⌘/Ctrl + T (new tab) continue to work.

**Q: Can I customize or disable shortcuts?**

Not yet. Future updates may introduce a preferences panel for custom key-mapping.

**Q: How do I copy a branch into another workflow?**

Use ⌘/Ctrl + Shift + C to copy the branch, open the destination via Workflow Switcher in a new tab, then ⌘/Ctrl + V to paste.

**Q: Does Delete All Actions downstream remove goals or waits?**

Yes—everything visually connected after the selected node is removed. Double-check the highlight preview before confirming.
