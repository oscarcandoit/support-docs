Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 9:42 AM

Create urgency that speaks your audience’s language. With custom Countdown Timer labels, you can display “Days,” “Hours,” “Minutes,” and “Seconds” or any wording you’d like, in the exact language or wording that matches your campaign.

# **What are Countdown Timer Labels?**

Custom Countdown Timer Labels let you replace the default “Days / Hours / Minutes / Seconds” text beneath every timer segment with wording of your choice. The feature also auto-detects a user’s account locale and pre-fills the labels in their native language, saving setup time and ensuring culturally relevant timers.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Countdown Timer Labels**

- **Localize Instantly:** Default text aligns with the sub-account’s language settings for a true global experience.

- **Match Brand Voice:** Swap “Hours” for “Hrs” or “Heures” to keep copy on-brand.

- **Increase Clarity:** Use campaign-specific phrasing like “Shopping Days Left.”

- **Reduce Design Work:** No need to create separate graphics for each language.

- **Boost Conversions:** Readers engage more when timers feel familiar and clear.

* * *

## **Default Labels**

Countdown Timer uses your account’s locale to set starter labels automatically. You can leave these as-is or tweak them to accommodate slang, abbreviations, or fully custom copy.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Are label changes retroactive?**

Yes. Updating the label text will refresh every live instance of that timer.

**Q: Can I use different labels for email vs. funnels?**

Each individual timer holds one set of labels. Create a duplicate timer if you need distinct phrasing.

**Q: Does auto-translation work for all languages?**

The system sets defaults based on your sub-account language, but manual edits may still be needed for dialect nuances.

**Q: Will changing labels affect dynamic links or expiry actions?**

No. Label edits only update on-screen text; all redirects and logic remain unchanged.
