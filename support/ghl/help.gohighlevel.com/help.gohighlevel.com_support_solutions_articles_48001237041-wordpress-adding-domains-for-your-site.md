## **How to add Domains to your WordPress website?**

Adding a domain to a WordPress site is necessary to make the website accessible to the public through that Domain. A domain serves as the website's address, and visitors can use it to access the site.

The article provides step-by-step instructions for adding a primary domain, additional domains, and a root domain (also known as an apex domain or naked Domain) to a WordPress site.

It also highlights that users may need a staging domain before adding domains to their WordPress website to see how their Website looks before they attach their domain to it. It also provides specific instructions for users with a domain in GoDaddy.

Thank you, Parag! 🙏

### **a)  Adding new Root domain as your Primary Domain:**

To add your first Root Domain _(example: theparag.com)_, click the 'Add Domain' button. Here you can configure your domain in 3 simple steps:![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026878441/original/dF8L7f86mmFDIy3Dh3K2zWEC5fmy8bvnZA.png?1717133790)

**Step 1: Add Domain Name**

Enter your Domain name and click on the 'Add Domain' Button. If your domain is not added in any other sub-accounts, you will be proceeded to the next step for SSL Validation.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026878504/original/Ww7-d2mm5gRrMiF0T4_ZMhgu8PRdejrjzw.png?1717133966)

**Step 2: Configure SSL Certificate**

Here you will get **two TXT records.** Add your TXT records to your DNS Provider and make sure to set the TTL Value to the lowest value possible.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026878537/original/-ZHRv4Cuuai2vNOR3Jp2KtCT64zvZ_SaUw.png?1717134084)

**Step 2: Update DNS**

2) Once you add your txt records with your domain provider, click on the confirmation box and proceed to verify records. You will now get one **A Record and CNAME value.** Additionally add the CNAME, if you want to add the WWW subdomain to the website _(Ex: www.theparag.com)_ .

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026878610/original/Vj4OyV2dt3ENLS91G_VTRkIt99VPEbI8CA.jpeg?1717134265)

2) Copy the Key and Value of the A-record. Configure the A-record for your Domain in your DNS provider.

**Please Note:**

```
If you are using CLoudflare, please make sure to disable Cloudflare Proxy and switch the Proxy status to DNS only.
```

3) To mark this domain as Primary, go to Dashboard and click on your Domain and Mark it as Primary.

### **b) Adding WWW domain as Primary for your WordPress site**

1) While adding www version of root domain (www.theparag.com) when (theparag.com) is already added, you will get the below instruction. Configure the **CNAME Key and Value** generated with your DNS provider and the domain should work as expected.

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48293451643/original/6mV1Ucwwcj_SaXFoeMs5_0vVXUpfGGYmdg.png?1681907964)**

2) In an alternative scenario when a user tries to add a root domain namely - _theparag.com_, when there already is a domain existing as _www.theparag.com_, the user will get an A-Record which they can configure in their DNS Provider

### **c) Adding Sub-Domain to WP site:**

1) When a user tries to add a Sub-Domain, Configure the **2 TXT records** generated with your DNS Provider.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48293452323/original/xRL6UjcYeB9FdjTYYttv3b-XW6UKzxQ5pQ.png?1681908200)

2) After configuring the TXT Records, click on **I have added the above domain records in my domain provider's DNS settings** checkbox, and then click on **Verify Records.**

3) You will now get a **CNAME Record. Copy the Key and Value of the CNAME. Configure the CNAME for your Domain in your DNS provider.**

3) You will see an unverified tag near the Domain for any added domain, but the DNS Verification is not yet done.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48292527850/original/9ykTXd3V8V5A-aIKRDWkP1_GWDUk6XBDdg.png?1681397851)

4\. Click on DNS Settings to add your credentials to your domain hosting platform
