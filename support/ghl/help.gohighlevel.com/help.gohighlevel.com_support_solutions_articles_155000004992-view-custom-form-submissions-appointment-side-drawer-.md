## Overview

The **View Form Submissions** feature allows users to see responses from custom booking forms directly within the **Appointment Modal**. This eliminates the need to navigate to the Forms module or Contacts to review details, making your scheduling workflow faster and more seamless.

* * *

## ? What’s New?

- **Forms Tab in Appointment Modal**

A new **Forms** tab appears within the Appointment Modal if the appointment has a **custom form** submission attached.

- **Structured Submission View**

Submitted form responses are displayed in a clean, structured format that mirrors the layout of the Forms module.

- **Access from Anywhere**

Whether you're in the **Calendars**, **Contacts**, or **Conversations** tab, clicking on an appointment will show the **Forms** tab if applicable.

* * *

## ? How to Use

1. **Navigate to Calendars**

Go to your Calendar and click on any recent appointment.

2. **Open Appointment Modal**

Click the appointment card to open its details.

3. **Check for the Forms Tab**

If a custom form was submitted during the booking process, a **Forms** tab will be visible in the modal.

4. **View Form Responses**

Click the Forms tab to see a detailed, structured view of the submission.


* * *

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This feature supports **only custom forms** added to the booking flow.

- **Form submissions will appear only for appointments created on or after April 9, 2025.**

- **Default booking form** submissions (Name, Email, Phone) do **not appear** in the Forms tab at this time, since this data is already shown in the Contact section.

- Support for viewing default form submissions inside the Forms tab is **coming soon**.


* * *

## ? Use Cases

- Quickly review intake questions and custom data before a meeting.

- Reduce back-and-forth between modules.

- Improve customer experience with more informed conversations.
