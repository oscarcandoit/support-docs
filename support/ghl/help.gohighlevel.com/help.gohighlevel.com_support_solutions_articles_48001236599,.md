Searching for contacts is possible via **Search > Contacts.**

Select the location you want to search for the contacts on this screen, and EAP will list all the contacts in this location.

Search for contacts within the location by first name, last name, tags, phone number, and address.

Select the contact and add it to the inbox of a specific agent by clicking on Add to Conversations.

### **Add Contact**

Eliza users can add a contact to a sub-account through Eliza by navigating to Search -> Contacts. These contacts will be synced to the respective GHL sub-account with the contact source field as ‘Eliza\_User.’ Once the contact is added to a sub-account through Eliza, the Eliza agent will have to assign it to themself or another agent manually. The sub-account audit log will show an entry for the added contact.

### **Add to Conversation**

If you want to engage with lead(s), choose the contact(s) and assign it to the agent from the dropdown. The contact(s) will be added to the inbox of the selected agent.

### **Audit log**

Select a contact to see the audit trail of all the conversations.

The audit trail will include the details about all the conversations between Eliza Agent and the contact, the disposition assigned, and the dates.
