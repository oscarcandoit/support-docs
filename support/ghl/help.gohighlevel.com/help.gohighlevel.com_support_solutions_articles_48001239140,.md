# Where and How to Configure the Missed Call Text Back Feature

Modified on: Wed, 28 May, 2025 at 9:28 AM

Do you want to avoid missing important calls and potentially losing out on business opportunities? HighLevel offers a convenient missed-call-text-back feature to help you stay on top of your game. This feature can quickly be able and allows you to send a text to missed calls automatically. This will ensure you take advantage of every chance to connect with your prospects or clients when they need you most.

In this how-to guide, we'll take you through everything you need to know to set up and use the HighLevel missed-call-text-back feature, so you can streamline your communication and focus on growing your business. Let's get started!

**Please Note:**

```
The missed-call-text-back feature will trigger an SMS notification for every missed call, even if the caller tries multiple times within a brief timeframe.

To avoid receiving multiple SMS notifications for missed calls, it is suggested to create and customize the existing recipe in workflows and personalize it to manage according to your preference (Try adding a 20+/- min  wait step, or filter using tags - 1st call, 2nd call etc).
```

## **How to Configure the Missed Call Text Back Feature**

### **Navigate to Settings**

Start by logging into your sub-account and heading over to the left-hand menu. Scroll to the bottom and click on the **Settings** tab. This is where all the backend controls for your account live.

### **Go to Phone Numbers**

Once you’re inside the settings menu, find and click on **Phone Numbers** in the left sidebar. This section manages all number-related settings for your sub-account. After opening the Phone Numbers section, click on the A **dvanced Settings** tab at the top. This is where you’ll find controls for voicemail, missed call text back, call scripts, and more.

### **Open the ‘Voicemail & Missed Call Textback’ Section**

Within Advanced Settings, click on the Voicemail & Missed Call Textback tab. This is where the magic happens for setting up your MCTB preferences.

### **Adjust the Incoming Call Timeout**

This option lets you set how long the phone should ring before the missed call text back triggers. Use the slider to choose a timeout duration—10 to 20 seconds is typically recommended.

### **Upload a Voicemail Audio File (Optional)**

You can also add a custom voicemail message here if you want. Upload a pre-recorded file in mp3, wav, or similar formats. This will play instead of the carrier’s generic voicemail.

### **Enable and Customize the Missed Call Text Back**

Scroll to the bottom of the page, and you’ll see the **“Enabled Missed Call Text Back”** checkbox. Tick this box to turn the feature on. Then, click **Customize** to tailor the message that goes out when someone misses you.

### **Customize the Message Content**

Once you’ve clicked the Customize button, this opens a pop-up where you can craft your automated response message. In the Enter message field, type the content you want sent when a call is missed. You can also use the custom value tag icon to insert dynamic placeholders such as the contact’s name—just remember, these only work if the system already recognizes the contact from a prior interaction.

### **Select Sending Number for Test**

Below the message editor, you’ll find a field where you can specify the phone number used to send a test message. This dropdown will display your connected numbers. Select the number you’d like to use to preview how the message will appear when sent to customers.

### **Send a Test and Save Your Settings**

Once you’ve configured your message and selected a sending number, click the Send Test button to send yourself a preview of the message. This helps ensure everything appears as expected. After reviewing, click the Save button to finalize your settings and activate the updated missed call text back configuration.
