## Why This Playbook Matters

It’s not just about being online—it’s about being remembered.

With 85% of sellers and 92% of buyers starting their journey online, your content strategy can either drive consistent listings or leave you stuck chasing leads.

But here’s where most consultants fall short:

- They rely only on referrals and ignore brand building.

- They post listings, not solutions.

- They don’t have a repeatable, scalable system to generate content that brings in seller calls or buyer DMs.


This playbook gives you the framework to:

✅ Build authority as a local real estate expert

✅ Attract leads even when you’re not actively selling

✅ Create content that moves clients through the sales cycle

✅ Use HighLevel to automate, scale, and dominate your local market

```

## What You'll Learn

✅ The 4 content types that drive listings and build trust

✅ Platform-specific strategies for organic reach and conversion

✅ Real examples of high-performing real estate content

✅ How to track what’s working and double down on results

✅ How HighLevel helps automate your content strategy end-to-end

✅ How to blend offline + online content for maximum visibility

* * *

## Step 1: Understand the Content That Attracts Leads

### Why It Matters

Without structure, posting becomes guesswork. Great content builds credibility and nurtures both buyers and sellers into long-term clients.

* * *

### 1.1 Four Core Content Types for Real Estate Consultants

| Content Type | Purpose | Example Post |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Educational | Build trust, answer questions | “Should You Buy or Rent in \[City\] in 2025?” |
| Engagement-Driven | Increase reach, start conversations | “Would you rather live downtown or in the suburbs? Comment ⬇️” |
| Promotional | Drive leads and listings | “Get Your Home’s Value in 60 Seconds – Free Tool Here” |
| Social Proof / Credibility | Reinforce your reputation | “Just Helped a Family Close on Their Dream Home in 3 Weeks!” |

✅ **Pro Tip**: Use the 80/20 Rule

80% of your content should educate and engage, while 20% promotes a clear CTA (consultation, valuation request, guide download).

* * *

## Step 2: Pick the Right Platforms (and Use Them Well)

### Why It Matters

Every platform serves a unique role in the buying/selling journey. When you post with intent, your pipeline grows on autopilot.

* * *

### 2.1 Platform Guide for Real Estate Consultants

| Platform | Best For | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facebook | Listing posts, local trust, testimonials | 3–5x per week |
| Instagram | Visual storytelling, reels, buyer content | 4–6x per week |
| LinkedIn | Investor, referral & relocation leads | 2–3x per week |
| YouTube | Searchable content: area tours, FAQs, walkthroughs | 1–2x per week |
| Google Business Profile | Local search, reviews, updates | 2–4x per month |
| Blog/Newsletter | SEO, market updates, email nurture | 2–4x per month |
| Offline | Flyers, QR codes, yard signs, local magazine | Seasonal Campaigns |

✅ **Pro Tip**: Agents who update their GBP weekly get 2X the call volume from Google Maps & local searches.

* * *

## Step 3: Create Content That Converts

### Why It Matters

Content is sales at scale—when structured correctly.

* * *

### 3.1 The Real Estate Hook–Value–Action Formula

✅ **Hook**: “Thinking about selling your home in \[City\]?”

✅ **Value**: “Here are 3 things to do now to get top dollar in 2024.”

✅ **CTA**: “DM me ‘SELL’ and I’ll send you my 15-step seller checklist.”

* * *

### 3.2 Content Strategy Examples

| Content Type | Headline | CTA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Educational | “How to Buy with 5% Down in Today’s Market” | “Get my First-Time Buyer Toolkit” |
| Engagement | “Would you rather a home office or bigger kitchen?” | “Vote in the comments!” |
| Promotional | “We Just Listed a 3BR in \[Neighborhood\] – See Photos” | “Click here to book a showing” |
| Social Proof | “Closed! Helped Sarah go from renter to owner in 45 days” | “Want to be next? DM me for a consult” |

* * *

## Step 4: Track What Works (and Fix What Doesn’t)

### Why It Matters

If you don’t know what’s working, you can’t scale. HighLevel’s analytics let you see exactly which posts drive clicks, bookings, and revenue.

* * *

### 4.1 Key Content Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | What It Tells You |
| --- | --- |
| Engagement Rate | Are people connecting with your content? |
| Link Clicks/CTR | Is your CTA strong enough to drive action? |
| Form Submissions | Are you converting views into leads? |
| Lead Source Tracking | Which content channel delivers the best ROI? |
| Booking Rate | What % of content leads convert to consults? |

✅ **Pro Tip**: Real estate businesses that follow up within 10 mins of a lead converting are 8X more likely to close.

* * *

## Step 5: Automate with HighLevel and Scale

### Why It Matters

You’re busy showing homes and closing deals—HighLevel handles your content engine while you focus on clients.

* * *

### 5.1 How HighLevel Powers Your Content Strategy

| Feature | Real Estate Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Social Media Planner | Pre-schedule all weekly content from one dashboard |
| AI-Powered Content Builder | Create reels, captions, blog intros in 1 click |
| Lead Capture Forms & Pages | Send traffic from social directly into your CRM |
| Review Request Automation | Boost reputation after every close |
| Smart Lists | Retarget leads based on interest or location |
| Automated DMs & Replies | Answer Facebook/IG leads instantly with listing info |

* * *

## Final Thoughts: Content = Closings

✅ The more you educate, the more you’re trusted

✅ The more consistent you are, the more you’re remembered

✅ The more strategic your content, the more you close

Social media is no longer optional—it’s a sales machine when used right.

* * *

## Your Next Steps

✅ Set up your HighLevel Social Planner

✅ Create 4 posts using the Hook–Value–CTA formula

✅ Track leads by source in your HighLevel dashboard

✅ Double down on what performs best

Ready to make content your #1 lead source?
