# Dashboard Summary AI

Modified on: Thu, 30 Oct, 2025 at 11:51 AM

We’ve completely reimagined the dashboard experience by bringing AI-powered insights to the forefront. Now, instead of just viewing raw numbers, you can instantly uncover trends, spot risks, and take action—directly from your dashboards. Click Summarize Dashboard button to unveil the AI powered knowledge.

What’s New

- Fresh Header Re-Design - A cleaner, modernized header makes it easier to navigate, filter, and edit your dashboards with fewer clicks.
- Dashboard AI Summary- With a single click, AI generates a smart summary of your dashboard—highlighting key metrics, growth patterns, and areas that need your attention.
- Generated AI Insights- AI doesn’t just summarize—it explains. Get context-rich insights like revenue peaks, performance drops, and next-step recommendations, helping you stay proactive instead of reactive.
- Follow-ups on Dashboard Summary- Ask follow-up questions directly from the summary to dive deeper. Whether you want to know what’s driving trends or explore specific metrics, AI gives you answers in seconds.
- Widget-Level AI Summaries-Zoom in on any widget—like your Opportunities line chart—and instantly see an AI-generated breakdown of configurations, performance, and comparisons, without manual digging.

Why It Matters

1. Stop drowning in data—let AI highlight what matters most.
2. Make faster, smarter business decisions with ready-to-use insights.
3. Stay ahead of risks by identifying downward trends before they hurt performance.

Getting Started

Look for the ✨

Summarize Dashboard with AI

button at the top of your dashboards and experience a smarter, more actionable way to work with data.

Note

1. User needs to enable AI Employee in order to use the AI summaries and widget summaries.
2. AI Employee model window allows users to browse previous conversation to revisit the summaries and widget detailed by AI
3. Followups only work on custom widgets and not on standard widget
4. If you share your feedback with us, we are actively working on improving the Dashboard AI

What’s Next for Dashboard AI?

In the future, Dashboard AI will go beyond summaries and insights. Users will be able to create widgets directly from screenshots or references, making setup faster than ever. These widgets will come with side-by-side real-time analysis and goal-driven suggestions, tailored to how a specific niche or industry is performing.
