## **What are Snapshot Notification Preferences?**

Snapshot Notification Preferences is a high-level enhancement that enables comprehensive control over email notifications associated with snapshot deployments. By leveraging this feature, Agency Admins can determine if the initiating user and up to five other Admins receive an email notification after a snapshot push is completed. This targeted approach ensures that critical updates, including details on completed and failed sub-accounts as well as a direct link to the push history, reach the team members who need them most.

```
IMPORTANT:
1. You must be an Agency Admin to make any changes to these settings.
2. This feature works per snapshot, so you can customize preferences for each one.
3. Notifications will only be sent when a push completes, not when it starts or fails midway.
```

## **Key Benefits and Features of Snapshot Notification Preferences**

Snapshot Notification Preferences delivers several key benefits designed to improve operational efficiency and team collaboration:

- **Enhanced Communication:** Critical updates are sent immediately to designated team members, ensuring that everyone remains informed.

- **Streamlined Operations:** Eliminates the need for routine manual checks by automating the notification process.

- **Faster Problem Resolution:** Provides a direct link to push details so any issues can be quickly identified and addressed.

- **Push Notification:** Push Notification settings allow Agency Admins to decide whether the user initiating the snapshot push should receive an email confirmation once the process is complete. This setting ensures that those directly involved in the snapshot push are promptly informed of the outcome, promoting accountability and transparency.

- **Email Content:** The notification emails are designed to convey essential information at a glance. Each email includes the count of successfully completed sub-accounts and the number of sub-accounts that experienced failures. A direct link to the full push history for detailed insights. This comprehensive information enables Admins to rapidly assess the state of the deployment process.

- **Admin Control:** With Admin Control, any Agency Admin can fine-tune the notification preferences. This functionality embraces flexibility by allowing configuration of, whether the snapshot initiator receives an email notification. Up to five additional Agency Admins who should receive snapshot push email notifications. Agency Admins retain full control, while Agency Users can view these settings without editing permissions, ensuring configuration integrity.

- **User View Only:** To maintain administrative oversight, Agency Users are granted view-only access to snapshot notification settings. This means that while they can monitor the configuration, only Agency Admins hold the authority to make any changes. This separation helps preserve the accuracy and security of the notification setup.
