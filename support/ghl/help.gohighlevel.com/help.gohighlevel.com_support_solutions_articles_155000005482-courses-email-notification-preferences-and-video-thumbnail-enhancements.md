We're excited to introduce Email Notification preferences in the membership courses! This update allows course creators to take complete control over their email content, offering a tailored, user-specific communication experience that enhances clarity and relevance for end users.

We’ve introduced a new option that allows you to upload custom thumbnails for your videos. With this feature, you can choose or upload an image that best represents your video content. Custom thumbnails make your videos more visually appealing, helping to attract viewers and improve engagement.

- Course creators now have the ability to manage whether emails are sent for different types of notifications. This allows creators to control communication with their students, ensuring only relevant notifications, such as course updates, reminders, or announcements, are sent.
