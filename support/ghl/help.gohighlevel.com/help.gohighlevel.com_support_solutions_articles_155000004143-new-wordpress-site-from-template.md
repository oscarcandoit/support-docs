# **What are Wordpress Site Templates?**

Wordpress Sites are an alternative to HighLevel Websites / Funnels. Instead of using HighLevel's built-in Site builder and host, you can hot a full Wordpress installation. This requires subscribing to HighLevel's Wordpress hosting plan, then you can use it like any other hosted Wordpress site.

When you create a new Wordpress Site you can opt to browse the Template library and select one of the premade Wordpress sites. You will have a brief delay as the Wordpress Site  is setup from the Template you selected.

## **Why You Should Use Wordpress Site Templates**

The Wordpress Site Templates are designed to help you launch beautiful and functional Wordpress sites almost instantly with almost zero effort. All you have to do is customize it.
