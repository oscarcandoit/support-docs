### **Why This Playbook Matters?**

#### You know how to **repair heating systems, install energy-efficient AC units, and maintain ventilation systems**—but are you using social media to **keep your schedule full year-round?**

#### Many HVAC businesses **struggle with inconsistent work** because they rely only on seasonal demand and referrals.

- #### **77% of homeowners check social media before hiring a contractor.**

- #### **40% of customers book the first HVAC company they see online.**

- #### **Businesses that post consistently get 3X more leads than those that don’t.**


#### Yet, many HVAC companies either **ignore social media, post inconsistently, or don’t have a clear strategy.**

### **The Truth?**

#### Social media is **your 24/7 lead-generation tool—when done right.**  This playbook will show you how to **turn posts into profits, followers into customers, and your HVAC business into a lead magnet.**

* * *

## **What You'll Learn?**

#### ✅ How social media generates **paying customers**—not just likes.  ✅ Which platforms are worth your time ( **Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google**).  ✅ The **best content strategy** to attract leads, build trust, and get referrals.  ✅ How to **run low-cost, high-ROI ads** specifically for HVAC businesses.  ✅ How to **automate posting, responses, and lead follow-ups**—so you focus on HVAC jobs, not social media.

## **Step 1: Build a Powerful Social Media Presence**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### If **customers don’t know your HVAC business exists, they can’t hire you.**  Social media **builds trust, increases visibility, and generates high-intent leads.**

### **1.1 Pick the Right Platforms for HVAC Businesses**

#### ✅ **Facebook** → Ideal for **homeowners & property managers, local networking, and community groups.**  ✅ **Instagram** → Best for **before-and-after system installs, time-lapse repairs, and customer reviews.**  ✅ **LinkedIn** → Connect with **real estate agents, builders, and commercial HVAC clients.**  ✅ **YouTube** → SEO powerhouse— **video content ranks on Google and builds credibility.**  ✅ **Google Business Profile (GBP)** → Not just social— **your \#1 ranking tool for local HVAC searches.**

#### **Pro Tip:** Post updates, respond to reviews, and keep your business info current.

### **1.2 Optimize Your Social Media Profiles**

#### ✅ **Professional Branding** → Use a **clean HVAC logo** and branded cover photo.  ✅ **Complete Your Bio** → Add your **services, phone number, and a "Book Now" link.**  ✅ **Use a Pinned Post** → Highlight a **customer review or a seasonal HVAC offer.**  ✅ **Post Consistently** → Businesses that **post 3-5 times per week get 2X more leads.**

## **Step 2: Create Engaging & High-Value Content**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### Most HVAC businesses **fail at social media because they only post promotions.**

#### The secret?

#### **Give value first, sell later.**

#### **The 80/20 Rule:**  ✅ **80% value-driven content** (education, engagement, tips)  ✅ **20% promotional content** (discounts, lead-generation posts)

[How to Create Ad Campaign using existing Templates](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003502-ad-manager-create-ad-campaigns-using-templates)

### **2.1 Content Ideas That Get Engagement & Bookings**

- #### **Before & After HVAC Installs** → _Example: "From an old, inefficient system to energy savings in just one day!"_

- #### **Customer Reviews & Testimonials** → Builds trust with potential clients.

- #### **Seasonal HVAC Tips** → "Is your AC ready for summer? Here’s how to check!"

- #### **Myths vs. Facts** → _Example: "Myth: Closing vents saves energy. Fact: It actually increases system strain!"_

- #### **Behind the Scenes** → Show your team repairing a furnace or installing a smart thermostat.

- #### **Live Q&As** → Answer common homeowner questions on Facebook or Instagram Live.


### **2.2 Use Hashtags & Local Tags**

#### ✅ **Facebook & Instagram:** \#HVACTech \#ACRepair \#HomeComfort \#LocalHVAC  ✅ **LinkedIn:** \#HVACContractor \#CommercialHVAC \#EnergyEfficiency  ✅ **Google:** Post **weekly updates** with local keywords to **boost search rankings.**

## **Step 3: Turn Followers into Customers with Ads**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### **Only 5-10% of followers see unpaid posts.** Paid ads **ensure your business reaches homeowners** before they search for a new HVAC contractor.

### **3.1 Low-Cost Ad Strategies for HVAC Businesses**

#### ✅ **Facebook Lead Ads** → Customers **submit inquiries without leaving Facebook.**  ✅ **Instagram Retargeting Ads** → Show ads to **people who visited your website but didn’t book.**  ✅ **Google Local Services Ads (LSAs)** → Appear **at the top of search results.**  ✅ **YouTube Discovery Ads** → Promote **how-to videos & service highlights.**

### **3.2 How to Target the Right Audience**

#### ✅ **Target Homeowners & Property Managers** in your service area ( **ZIP codes & radius targeting**).  ✅ **Retarget Website Visitors** who checked your services but didn’t book.  ✅ **Exclude Renters & Irrelevant Audiences** to avoid wasted ad spend.

### **3.3 Suggested Ad Budgets for HVAC Businesses**

| #### Business Size | #### Suggested Ad Budget |
| --- | --- |
| #### **Solo HVAC Tech** | #### **$10/day (~$300/month)** for Facebook & Instagram Lead Ads |
| #### **Small HVAC Team (2-5 Techs)** | #### **$25/day (~$750/month)** for a multi-platform strategy |
| #### **Larger HVAC Company** | #### **$50/day (~$1500/month)** for brand awareness + lead generation |

## **Step 5: The Social Media Growth Blueprint**

#### **Why It Matters?**

| #### Day | #### Content Type | #### Platform |
