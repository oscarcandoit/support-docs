# Ad Manager Run As Ad & Create Engagement Ad

Modified on: Tue, 21 Oct, 2025 at 6:36 PM

New buttons bring one-click ad creation links (“breadcrumbs”) straight into two of HighLevel’s most-used tools—WhatsApp and Social Planner—so you can turn conversations and social posts into paid ads without ever hunting for Ad Manager.

## **What are the New Buttons (breadcrumbs) for Ad Manager in WhatsApp & Social Planner?**

There are now buttons in WhatsApp and Social Planner that open Ad Manager in one-click preconfigured to run an ad. These context-aware “Create Engagement Ad” (WhatsApp) and “Run as Ad” (Social Planner) buttons deep-link to Ad Manager. Each link pre-loads the relevant campaign objective and post content, trimming several manual steps from the usual ad-creation flow.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Breadcrumbing**

• Accelerates campaign setup—pre-selected objective, destination, media, and copy cut down form-filling time.

• Boosts Ad Manager adoption by surfacing upgrade prompts exactly where non-Ad-Manager users work.

• Improves workflow continuity—marketers move from organic content to paid promotion in a single click.

• Reduces user error; the correct objective (Engagement) and channel (WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram) are automatically applied.

* * *

## **WhatsApp > Create Engagement Ad**

Quickly convert a WhatsApp phone number into an Engagement campaign.

• Button location: Settings > WhatsApp > Numbers tab, next to “Add Number”.

• Auto-filled in Ad Manager:

    – Objective: Engagement

    – Destination: WhatsApp

    – Budget, audience, and creative remain editable.

• Users without Ad Manager see a subscription-benefits modal with “Connect Ad Manager” CTA.

• Users with Ad Manager but without a connected Ad Account see a button "Connect Account".

## **Social Planner > Run As Ad**

Promote published or scheduled Facebook/Instagram posts without re-uploading assets.

• Where you’ll see “Run as Ad”:

\- Marketing > Social Planner > Planner tab > 3-dot action menu on list row

\- Marketing > Social Planner > Content tab > Approval tab > 3-dot action menu on list row

    \- Marketing > Social Planner > post detail sidebar

• Supported post statuses: Published, Scheduled, In Review (not Draft or Recurring).

• Redirect flow: click > confirm modal > Ad Manager opens → choose Google or Meta → campaign pre-filled with media & caption (text-only posts remain editable).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Does breadcrumbing cost extra?**

A. No. The feature is free, but the sub-account must have an active Ad Manager subscription or pay-as-you-go plan.

**Q. Can I use “Run as Ad” for TikTok or LinkedIn posts?**

A. Not yet. Breadcrumbing currently supports Facebook and Instagram posts only.

**Q. What happens if I edit a post after turning it into an ad?**

A. Changes made in Social Planner will not sync to the live ad; edit the creative directly inside Ad Manager instead.

**Q. Why don’t I see the “Create Engagement Ad” button in WhatsApp?**

A. Confirm you’re on the Numbers tab and that your location has WhatsApp enabled. Standard user permissions also apply.

**Q. Can I bypass the confirmation modal?**

A. No. The modal prevents accidental navigation and clarifies you’re entering the Ad Manager flow.
