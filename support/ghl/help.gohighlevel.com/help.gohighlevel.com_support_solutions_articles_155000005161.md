## **What is Content Genius?**

Content Genius is an AI-powered SEO text editor that helps you write, plan, and optimize content all in one place. It acts as both a writing assistant and SEO advisor.

**Key capabilities include:**

- Real-time SEO scoring and suggestions

- AI writing assistance for full content generation

- Competitor analysis to suggest subtopics and terms

- Integration with the Content Planner for keyword-driven content creation


* * *

## **Two Ways to Create Content: “Write Yourself” vs “Write with AI”**

### **A. Writing Content Manually (“Write Yourself”)**

**How to use the editor manually:**

1. **Open Content Genius** from Advanced SEO: Content > Content Genius.

(You may be prompted to create a Content Settings Folder with your preferences.)

2. Click **“New Article”** or “Write Yourself”.

3. **Enter Topic/Title** and **Target Keywords** (e.g., “How to Clean Teeth Properly at Home”).

4. Begin writing in the blank editor.

5. Use the **SEO sidebar** to get optimization suggestions.

6. Follow suggestions like improving word count, adding missing terms, etc.

7. **Optimize the Content Score** (aim for “Great” or high numeric score).

8. Finalize and export/publish the article.


**Quota Usage (Manual):**

- 1 **Article quota**

- +1 **Keyword quota** per target keyword

- **No AI premium quota** is used


Example:

An article with 2 keywords = 1 article credit + 2 keyword credits.

* * *

### **B. Generating Content with AI (“Write with AI”)**

**Steps to generate an article:**

1. Go to **Content Genius after launching advanced SEO > Write with AI**

2. Fill in:

   - **Title/Topic**

   - **Target Keywords**

   - **Location** (Optional)
3. Select **tone/style** if available

4. Click **Generate AI Content**

5. AI analyzes top results and creates a new draft

6. **Review and edit**:

   - Refine tone, structure, facts, and SEO

   - Use the sidebar suggestions to improve content score
7. Finalize and save


**Quota Usage (AI-Generated):**

- 3 **AI premium credits**

- 1 **Article credit**

- +1 **Keyword credit** per target keyword


Example:

3 keywords → total 7 credits (3 AI + 1 article + 3 keywords)

**You get 10 AI Premium credits/month** = ~3 AI articles per month.

* * *

### **Tips for Using AI Effectively**

- **Use for First Drafts:** Always edit AI content before publishing

- **Target Multiple Keywords:** 1 primary + 1–2 secondary is ideal

- **Leverage Outlines:** Use outlines to pre-check structure

- **Monitor Content Length:** Ensure your article matches competitor depth

- **Avoid Recent/Specific Topics:** Write manually for current events


* * *

## **Content Planner: Organize and Strategize with Topic Clusters**

Content Planner helps build a content roadmap with related keyword clusters.

**How to use Content Planner:**

1. Go to **Content > Content Planner**

2. Enter a **Seed Topic/Keyword** (e.g., “Teeth Cleaning”)

3. Choose **Location/Language**

4. Tool analyzes SERPs and gathers related keywords

5. Keywords are grouped into **clusters** (e.g., "Professional Cleaning", "Home Remedies")

6. View in **Table View** or diagram format

7. Click “Create Article” from a cluster to open Content Genius

8. Write manually or generate with AI

9. Save/export clusters for planning


* * *

### **Quota Usage:**

- **10 Content Plans per month**

- Clustering appears to use minimal AI credits (unless Topical Maps are used)


* * *

## **Topical Maps: (Advanced Content Strategy Visualization)**

Topical Maps provide a structured diagram of content clusters around a main keyword.

- Go to **Topical Map** inside Content Genius.

- Click **Create Topical Map**.

- Provide details like **Folder Settings**, **Pillar Page URL**, **Target Keyword**, and **Language**.

- Set the number of clusters, long-tail keywords per cluster, and article titles to generate.

- Click **Create & Continue**.


**You can:**

- View your topical map in **Diagram** or **Table** format.

- Add ideas to the topical map by clicking **Add To Topical Map**.

- Create articles directly from your added topics.


**Quota Usage (Topical Maps):**

- 3 **AI Premium credits per map**

- 1 **AI credit per AI article generated from a map**


Use for large-scale planning or pillar-based content strategies.

* * *

## **Quota Usage Summary for Content Tools**

| Tool | Monthly Quota | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Articles** | 30 | Each new article = 1 slot |
| **Target Keywords** | 100 | Each keyword = 1 credit |
| **AI Premium** | 10 | 3 per AI-generated article |
| **Content Plans** | 10 | Cluster maps for content strategy |
| **Topical Maps** | 3 credits each | Use selectively |

**Example Usage:**

- 3 AI articles = 9 AI credits

- 2 manual articles = 2 article credits

- 5 clusters = 5 Content Plans

- Total: 5 articles, 15 keywords, 9 AI credits


* * *

## **Best Practices for Content Creation**

- **Quality Over Quantity:** Focus on editing AI content for clarity and value

- **Match Search Intent:** Align tone with what top-ranking pages offer

- **Add Unique Value:** Personalize with brand voice or examples

- **Optimize Readability:** Use headings, bullets, short paragraphs

- **Internal Linking:** Connect to relevant pages on your site

- **Monitor Performance:** Use Rank Tracker and GSC to assess outcomes

- **Avoid Plagiarism:** Review AI text and customize

- **Use Suggested Titles:** Start with AI's suggestions, then personalize


* * *

## **Troubleshooting & Common Issues**

- **AI Content Off-Topic:** Refine prompt or regenerate (uses credits again)

- **Article Limit Reached:** Quota resets monthly; remove unused drafts

- **Keyword Quota Used:** Check for excessive keywords; streamline targets

- **Content Planner Issues:** Adjust seed keyword breadth

- **Topical Map Fails:** Reduce cluster count or check credit availability

- **Multiple Users:** All users share the same quotas

- **Save Work Frequently:** Autosave usually works, but backup manually

- **Export Formatting Errors:** Tweak exported HTML/format for your CMS


* * *

By effectively using Content Genius and Planner, you can dramatically speed up content production while maintaining or even improving quality. This means more pages to rank for more keywords, feeding back into the SEO results you track.
