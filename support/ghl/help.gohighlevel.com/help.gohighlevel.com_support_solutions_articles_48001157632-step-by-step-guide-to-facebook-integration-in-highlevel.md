# **Overview of Facebook Integration**

Facebook integration allows you to connect your Facebook Business Page and sync leads directly into a HighLevel sub-account.

Once connected, you can also enable access to your Instagram Business account if it's linked to your Facebook page.

- **Lead Automation**: Automatically syncs new Facebook leads to your CRM

- **Form Field Mapping**: Aligns Facebook form responses with CRM fields

- **Sync Options**: Choose to pull in past leads or only new ones going forward
