# Step-by-step guide to set up Mailgun

Modified on: Tue, 23 Jul, 2024 at 1:39 PM

Mailgun Step-by-step guide:

**1\. Sign up for Mailgun here:**

[https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup)

**2\. Check your email inbox to verify the email address**

**3\. Click Sending > Add New Domain**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48243535197/original/doBfy9jAqoxcOqD5LiuyQO9rnyVWfkkAeg.png?1659724186)

**4\. If your domain is companyname.com, you can either set up the main domain or subdomain with Mailgun.**

- Main domain:
  - If you are adding the main domain, it should not be used with Gsuite, or any other email provider
- Subdomain:
  - To set up the subdomain with Mailgun, you can type **ANYTHING\_HERE**.companyname.com
    - Examples:
      - mg.companyname.com
      - replies.companyname.com
      - support.companyname.com
- Please set up the domain or subdomain under US, **not EU**.
- Click **Add domain**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48243536037/original/B5DZocdO2h64MlEDtfuFjER-U_0AO_NOEg.png?1659724559)

**5\. Now log in to your DNS records based on where you get the domain and add the 5 DNS records.**

- If you are not sure where you should add the DNS records
- Step 1: lookup domain that we are trying to set up in [mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx)
- Only put the domain here, **do not add http:// in front**



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48243537503/original/VQuAatUlq58RsSVIlLqFfKJQsi1EtB2pjg.png?1659725181)

Once you look up the domain, it should show what your DNS hosting provider is.

- ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48243537328/original/O4VqrFqJo6APt8Z_bhPobo_S50QD230bQg.png?1659725095)
- Step 2: check the bottom note it will say reported by e.g. [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/)

- Now we could add the DNS records to the domain provider. We can google **wordpress DNS records** if you are not sure where to locate the DNS records area.


Based on what your domain provider is, now we could add the DNS records according to the domain provider:

If you don't find the domain provider on this list, you can refer to one of the articles above, which should be similar.
