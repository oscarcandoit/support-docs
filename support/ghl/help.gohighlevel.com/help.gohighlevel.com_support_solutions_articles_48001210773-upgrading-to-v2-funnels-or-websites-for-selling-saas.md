If you are selling SaaS products via your funnels or websites, you may need to upgrade your funnels or websites to version 2 available in all accounts before **15 March 2022**.

# What are v2 funnels & websites?

v2 funnels and websites are more secure, faster, better converting & more feature packed successors of OG funnels & websites.

You can learn more about the differences between v2 -vs- v1 funnels & websites in these articles

1. [https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204164-different-websites-funnels-versions-within-the-system](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204164-different-websites-funnels-versions-within-the-system)
2. [https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204903-how-to-upgrade-a-version-1-funnel-to-version-2-](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204903-how-to-upgrade-a-version-1-funnel-to-version-2-)

# Why do I need to move to v2 funnels if I am selling SaaS?

You need to upgrade your existing funnels & websites that you use to sell SaaS to v2 versions because of enhanced security and card authorization capabilities that are built into v2 funnels. This will provide you a more robust and secure subscription management experience for your SaaS initiative.

v2 funnels & websites

- allow you to create one-step order checkouts
- are compatible with 3D secure payments
- are faster
- use Stripe connect integration instead of API key integration
- work better with products, prices & payments features
- have built -in card authorization security when you sell a recurring product

```
v2 funnels & websites are better than v1 funnels & websites in all aspects.
```

In this article we will discuss how you can migrate to v2 funnels & websites if you are currently selling SaaS using an old funnel.

# How can I upgrade my SaaS funnels / websites to v2?

## Step 1 : How do I know which funnel / website version I am on?

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48197647579/original/F4rnqAlzI90rJk3l6GmgAscXUHuPqUI0Tg.png?1646436246)

If your SaaS selling funnel / website is already a v2 funnel, you do not need to take any more steps! You are all done.

If your SaaS selling funnel / website is a v1 funnel / website, please follow the steps further.

## Step 2 : Make sure you are using Stripe connect

```
Important:
In order to sell SaaS, this Stripe account must be the same as the Stripe account connected at your agency level.
```

To check which Stripe account is connected to your agency please navigate to Agency view -> Settings -> Stripe and look at the email ID as shown below

```
Important:
While connecting your Stripe account, you may be logged in to multiple email IDs or multiple accounts with the same email ID. Please make sure to select the right one.
```

## Step 3 : Upgrade old funnel to v2 funnel

### Before upgrading

Import your Stripe Products to your SaaS location using the steps in this article - [https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001202184-import-products-price-from-stripe](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001202184-import-products-price-from-stripe)

Your v1 funnel's product area would look something like this before upgrading.
