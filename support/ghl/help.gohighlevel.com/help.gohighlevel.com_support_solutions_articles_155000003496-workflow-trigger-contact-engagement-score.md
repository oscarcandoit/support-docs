## Overview

The **Contact Engagement Score** trigger is used to add contacts to a workflow based on their engagement score and other criteria, helping you to automate actions based on their interactions and overall engagement level.

## Trigger Name

**Contact Engagement Score**

## Trigger Description

This trigger allows you to filter contacts into a workflow based on their **Engagement Score** and other contact attributes. The trigger helps automate tasks like follow-ups, segmenting highly engaged contacts, or adjusting marketing efforts based on specific criteria.

## Trigger Details

| --- | --- | --- |
| Field Name | Description | Mandatory |
| Score | The engagement score of the contact. Filters are applied based on engagement criteria. | Yes |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Operator | Description |
| Equals to | Triggers if the score or field value equals the input value. |
| Greater than | Triggers if the score or field value is greater than the input value. |
| Greater than or Equal to | Triggers if the score or field value is greater than or equal to the input value. |
| Less than | Triggers if the score or field value is less than the input value. |
| Less than or Equal to | Triggers if the score or field value is less than or equal to the input value. |
| Is empty | Triggers if the field value is empty. |
| Is not empty | Triggers if the field value is not empty. |
| Contains Phrase | Triggers if the field contains the phrase entered. |
| Does not contain Phrase | Triggers if the field does not contain the entered phrase. |

## How to Configure

- **Step 1:** Select the trigger “Contact Engagement Score” from the workflow builder’s trigger options.
- **Step 2:** Give the trigger a name, such as “High Engagement Contacts.”
- **Step 3:** Set the filters to define the engagement score or other criteria.
  - For example, select **Score** from the filter dropdown and choose **Greater than**. Enter a value like **195**.
  - You can add additional filters like **Business Niche** and choose **Contains Phrase**, then enter the niche (e.g., **Education**).
- **Step 4:** Save the trigger configuration and add further actions or steps to your workflow as needed.

## Example

In this scenario, the **Contact Engagement Score** trigger is set to capture contacts with a score **Greater than 195** and in the **Education** niche. When the contact meets both criteria, they will be added to the workflow for a follow-up email campaign.
