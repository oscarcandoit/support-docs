## **Important Notes**

### **In-App Notifications:**

1. The in-app notification configuration is customisable - for example, you can turn on the confirmation notification for the calendar but keep all other types turned off.

2. For **Event Calendars**, the default setting is that account admins will receive the notifications.

3. For other calendar types, the **assigned user** will be selected by default to receive notifications.

### **Email Notifications:**

1. **Additional Emails** refers to any extra recipients you want to notify. Simply add their email addresses, and they’ll receive the notifications as well.

2. You can create your email templates through the **Email Builder** in **Marketing module > Emails > Templates.**
3. Ensure you have added a **subject line in your email template** for successful delivery.

4. If you have enabled the **Add Guest** function and have included a custom form, you can send that custom form to the guest as well. Enabling this option will send a system-generated email to guests with a link to the custom form once their appointment is confirmed. To prevent duplicate emails, ensure a separate confirmation email is not already set up for guests (verify this in the Notifications tab under **Confirmation Notification**).

### **SMS Notifications:**

1. **Additional Phone Numbers** refers to any extra recipients you want to notify. Simply add their phone number(s), and they’ll receive the notifications as well.

2. Phone numbers must **include country codes** for successful delivery.

3. SMS messages are billed per segments and are subject to charges. Keep them concise to manage costs.


### **Whatsapp Notifications:**

1. Ensure your **WhatsApp Business Account** is connected and verified.

2. Only **approved WhatsApp templates** can be used.

3. Use **Fetch New Templates** to refresh available templates.

4. Always test templates for formatting and content before enabling.
