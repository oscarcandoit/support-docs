## Overview

You can create funnel share links that let sub-account users import a funnel directly into their own account. With a quick adjustment, these links can also be formatted to use **your own white-labeled domain**, keeping everything fully branded to your agency.

* * *

## Steps to Create a Funnel Share Link

### 1\. Generate a Funnel Share Link

- Go to **Sites > Funnels**.

- Click the **three dots** next to the funnel you want to share.

- Select **Share**.

- Copy the generated share link. It will look like this:


```
https://affiliates.gohighlevel.com/?fp_ref=xxxx&funnel_share=6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```


### 2\. Grab the Funnel ID

- Paste the link and find the part after `funnel_share=`.

- Example:


```
funnel_share=6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```

- The **funnel ID** here is:


```
6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```


### 3\. Insert the Funnel ID Into the Template

- Use this template to build your custom share link:


```
https://app.YOURDOMAIN.com/funnels/share/FUNNELID
```

- Replace **YOURDOMAIN.com** with your white-labeled domain.

- Replace **FUNNELID** with the funnel ID you copied.


**Example:**

```
https://app.whitelabel.com/funnels/share/6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```

### 4\. Share the Custom Link

- Now you can share this link with sub-account users.
