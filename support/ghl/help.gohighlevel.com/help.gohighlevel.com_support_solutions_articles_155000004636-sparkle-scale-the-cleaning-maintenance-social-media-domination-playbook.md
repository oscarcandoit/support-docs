#### Many cleaning & maintenance businesses rely **only on referrals** and **struggle with inconsistent bookings**.

#### **Industry Metrics:**  ✅ **77% of customers** check **social media before hiring** a cleaning or maintenance service.  ✅ **45% of homeowners** book the **first company they engage with on social media**.  ✅ **Businesses that post consistently** get **3X more leads** than those that don’t.

#### Yet, many cleaning businesses **ignore social media**, post inconsistently, or don’t have a clear strategy.

#### **The truth?**

#### **Social media is your 24/7 lead-generation tool—when done right.**

#### This playbook will show you exactly how to **turn posts into profits, followers into customers, and your business into a growth engine.**

### **What You'll Learn?**

#### ✅ How **social media generates paying customers**—not just likes.  ✅ Which platforms are **worth your time** (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google).  ✅ The **best content strategy** to get **shares, engagement, and leads**.  ✅ How to **run low-cost, high-ROI social media ads** for cleaning & maintenance businesses.  ✅ How to **automate posting, responses, and lead follow-ups**—so you don’t have to.

### **Step 1: Build a Powerful Social Media Presence**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### If people **don’t know your business exists, they can’t hire you**.  A strong social presence **builds trust, increases visibility, and generates leads.**

#### **1.1 Pick the Right Platforms for Cleaning & Maintenance**

#### ✅ **Facebook** → Best for **local networking, community groups, and customer trust**.  ✅ **Instagram** → Great for **before-and-after project photos and video walkthroughs**.  ✅ **LinkedIn** → Helps connect with **property managers, real estate firms, and commercial clients**.  ✅ **YouTube** → **SEO powerhouse**—video content ranks on Google and **builds credibility**.  ✅ **Google Business Profile (GBP)** → Not just social media—your **\#1 ranking tool for local search.**

#### **Example Use Case:**  **A residential cleaning service in Florida** used **Google Business Profile & Instagram Stories** to showcase

#### **"Before & After Deep Cleaning" videos**.

#### Within **6 months**, they saw a **45% increase in bookings** and **secured long-term contracts** with real estate agents.

#### **1.2 Optimize Your Social Media Profiles**

#### ✅ **Professional branding** → Use a **clean logo and branded cover photo**.  ✅ **Complete your bio** → Add your **services, phone number, and a "Book Now" link**.  ✅ **Use a pinned post** → Highlight your **best customer review or a limited-time offer**.  ✅ **Post consistently** → Businesses that post **3-5 times per week** get **2X more leads**.

### **Step 2: Create Engaging & High-Value Content**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Most cleaning businesses **fail at social media** because they **only post promotions**.  The secret?

#### **Give value first, sell later.**

#### **80% of content should be educational, engaging, or entertaining.**  **20% should be promotional (special offers, direct CTAs, service highlights).**

#### **2.1 Content Ideas That Get Engagement & Bookings**

#### ✅ **Before & After Projects** → _"From Dusty to Spotless! See This Apartment Transformation in Just 3 Hours!"_  ✅ **Customer Reviews & Testimonials** → Builds trust & credibility.  ✅ **DIY Cleaning Tips** → _"5 Hacks to Keep Your Bathroom Mold-Free!"_  ✅ **Common Myths vs. Facts** → _"Myth: Vinegar Cleans Everything. Fact: It Can Damage Granite!"_  ✅ **Behind the Scenes** → Show your **team at work** in real cleaning & maintenance jobs.  ✅ **Live Q&As** → Answer **homeowner & business owner questions** on **Facebook or Instagram Live**.

#### **Example Use Case:**  **A janitorial service in New York** ran **a weekly "Cleaning Myth Busting" video series** on Facebook, increasing **engagement by 250%** and securing **4 long-term commercial clients**.

#### **[How to Create Ad Campaign using existing Templates](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003502-ad-manager-create-ad-campaigns-using-templates)**

#### **2.2 Use Hashtags & Local Tags**

#### ✅ **Facebook & Instagram** → \#HouseCleaning \#JanitorialServices \#MoveOutCleaning  ✅ **LinkedIn** → \#CommercialCleaning \#PropertyMaintenance \#OfficeCleaning  ✅ **Google** → Post **weekly updates** with **location-based keywords** to boost local rankings.

### **Step 3: Turn Followers into Customers with Ads**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Only **5-10% of followers see unpaid posts**. Paid ads **ensure** your business reaches customers **at the right time.**

#### **3.1 Low-Cost Ad Strategies for Cleaning Businesses**

#### ✅ **Facebook Lead Ads** → Customers submit inquiries **without leaving Facebook**.  ✅ **Instagram Retargeting Ads** → Show ads to **people who visited your website** but **didn’t book**.  ✅ **Google Local Services Ads (LSAs)** → Show up at the **top of search results**.  ✅ **YouTube Discovery Ads** → Promote **how-to videos & service highlights**.

#### **Example Use Case:**  **A maid service in California** ran **Instagram retargeting ads** offering **"20% off your first deep clean"** to users who had visited their website. Result?

#### A **30% increase in bookings** within a **3-month campaign**.

#### **3.2 How to Target the Right Audience**

#### ✅ **Target homeowners & property managers** in your **service area (ZIP codes & radius targeting).**  ✅ **Retarget website visitors** who **checked your services but didn’t book**.  ✅ **Exclude irrelevant audiences** to **avoid wasting money**.

#### **3.3 Suggested Ad Budgets for Cleaning Businesses**

| #### **Business Size** | #### **Suggested Ad Budget** |
| --- | --- |
| #### **Solo Cleaner** | #### $10/day (~$300/month) for Facebook & Instagram Lead Ads |
| #### **Small Team (2-5 employees)** | #### $25/day (~$750/month) for a **multi-platform strategy** |
| #### **Larger Business** | #### $50/day (~$1,500/month) for **brand awareness + lead generation** |
