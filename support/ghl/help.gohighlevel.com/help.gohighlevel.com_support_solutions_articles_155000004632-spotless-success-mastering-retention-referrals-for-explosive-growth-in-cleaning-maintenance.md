### **Why This Playbook Matters?**

#### Winning a new customer is **5X more expensive** than keeping an existing one. Yet, many cleaning businesses focus only on acquiring new leads, **ignoring the goldmine of repeat business and referrals.**

#### **The reality?**  ✅ **70% of cleaning customers** hire the same company again—if they follow up.  ✅ **Businesses with strong referral programs** grow **2X faster** than those relying only on ads.  ✅ **Companies that send review requests** after service get **35% more repeat customers**.

#### This playbook will show you how to turn **every happy customer into repeat business and a referral machine**, **without extra effort.**

### **What You'll Learn?**

#### ✅ How to **automate follow-ups** and keep customers coming back.  ✅ How to **get more 5-star reviews** to boost bookings & trust.  ✅ How to create a **referral program** that turns clients into sales reps.  ✅ How to offer **maintenance plans** to ensure steady revenue.  ✅ How to use **AI & Smart Lists** to engage customers and prevent churn.

### **Step 1: Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Most cleaning businesses **lose thousands** because they **don’t follow up** with past customers. You provide a great service, but if you **don’t remind them**, they **forget to book again**.

#### ? **Fact:** **62% of customers forget the name of their cleaning service after 3 months.**

#### **1.1 Post-Service Follow-Up Messages**

- #### Send an **automated thank-you SMS or email** after every cleaning job.

- #### Ask if everything is satisfactory & remind them about rebooking.

- #### Offer a **discount for their next service** to increase retention.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Hey Sarah, thanks for choosing \[Your Business Name\]! Hope you loved the cleaning. Want 15% off your next service? Book within the next 30 days & save!"_

#### [How to Automate Customer Follow-Ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001165881-how-to-build-automated-appointment-follow-up-surveys-in-workflow-builder)

#### **1.2 Automated Check-In Reminders**

- #### Set up **monthly or quarterly cleaning reminders** based on service type (e.g., deep cleaning, carpet cleaning, office janitorial services).

- #### Offer easy online booking **with one click.**


#### **Example Message:**  _"Sarah, it's been 3 months since your last deep clean! Need a refresh? Reply YES to schedule your next appointment."_

#### [How to Set Up Maintenance Reminders](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001167806-how-to-send-users-appointment-reminders)

### **Step 2: Get More 5-Star Reviews Automatically**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### **87% of customers** check online reviews before booking a cleaning service. **More 5-star reviews = higher rankings on Google & more bookings.**

#### **2.1 Automate Review Requests**

- #### Send **SMS & email review requests** right after service completion.

- #### Personalize the request with the customer’s **name & service details.**

- #### Direct customers to **Google, Yelp, and Facebook** for maximum visibility.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Hey Sarah, we loved cleaning for you! If we did a great job, could you leave us a quick review? It helps a lot! Click here: \[Google Review Link\]"_

#### [How to Automate Review Requests](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004632-spotless-success-mastering-retention-referrals-for-explosive-growth-in-cleaning-maintenance\#)

#### **2.2 Handle Negative Reviews Proactively**

- #### AI **flags negative reviews before they go public**.

- #### Offer a **quick resolution** before a bad review impacts your rating.


#### **Example:**  A customer had an issue with a cleaning. Instead of leaving a bad review, they get a **follow-up message:**  _"Hey Sarah, we noticed you weren’t fully satisfied. We want to make it right! Let’s schedule a free touch-up. Reply YES to book."_

### **Step 3: Create a Referral Machine**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Referral customers **convert 5X faster** and **spend 16% more** than new customers.  ? **Fact:** Cleaning businesses with referral programs see a **30% increase in revenue**.

#### **3.1 Set Up a Referral Program**

- #### Reward customers who refer friends & family with **discounts or service credits**.

- #### Offer **an incentive to both** the referrer & the new customer (e.g., **$25 off their next cleaning**).


#### **Example Message:**  _"Love our cleaning service? Refer a friend & you BOTH get $25 off your next booking! Just send them this link: \[Referral Link\]"_

#### [How to Set Up an Automated Referral Program](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001213448-affiliate-refferal-page-leads-customers-cancelled-statuses)

#### **3.2 Automate Referral Follow-Ups**

- #### Send a reminder after service:



#### _"Know someone who needs a cleaner? Refer them now & get $25 off!"_

- #### **Track referrals & apply rewards automatically** with HighLevel.


### **Step 4: Lock in Recurring Revenue with Maintenance Plans**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Cleaning businesses with **subscription-based maintenance plans** generate **30% more repeat business** and **higher customer retention rates**.

#### **4.1 Offer Service Plans for Recurring Work**

- #### Create **weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly** cleaning plans.

- #### Automate invoicing & renewal reminders **so customers never miss a cleaning**.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Join our VIP Cleaning Plan: Monthly home cleaning + priority booking for $99/month. Save $$ & keep your home spotless!"_

#### [How to Set Up Subscription-Based Services](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004138-pause-and-resume-subscriptions)

#### **4.2 Upsell Preventative Maintenance During Jobs**

- #### Train staff to **offer maintenance plans** at checkout.

- #### Give a **discount for signing up on the spot**.


#### **Example Message:**  _"Sarah, we just finished your deep cleaning. Want to lock in monthly maintenance? Sign up today & get $20 off!"_

### **Step 5: Use AI & Smart Lists to Boost Customer Engagement**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### Your past customers are **10X more likely to book again** than cold leads.  **HighLevel automates personalized outreach based on customer history.**

#### **5.1 Smart Lists for Re-Engagement**

- #### **Create lists** of past customers by **service type, location, or last booking date.**

- #### Send **seasonal promotions, upgrade offers, and rebooking reminders.**


#### **5.2 AI-Powered Follow-Ups & Surveys**

- #### Use AI to check in with past customers via SMS:



#### _"Hey \[First Name\], it’s been 3 months since your last cleaning. Need a refresh? Reply YES to book!"_

- #### **Send satisfaction surveys** to prevent churn and improve service.
