## **How to use custom fields in Ad Manager?**

Below is a short video on how you can create and use custom fields in Ad Manager during Lead form creation and form field mapping.

Currently while creating a lead form on Meta, we see the additional option to add Tracking Parameters:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041564028/original/bFbc4FdDDQtRZc0C1Hy8ZMEYfUeQXEUcXw.png?1739461771)

these fields are pulled in when a form created on Facebook is used in HL Ad Manager to create and publish ad campaigns. In order to sync these fields/parameters with the CRM, the form field mapping needs to be done.

The CRM fields which are custom and not present by default in the form field mapping section can be added as custom fields within HL for them to reflect as the CRM fields in the form field mapping section of the lead forms.

Steps to create a custom field and how to use it in the form field mapping is illustrated in the following video:

## **How to review, map and duplicate existing Facebook lead forms?**

As part of enhancing the lead form management experience in Ad Manager, we’ve introduced the ability to **review**, **map**, and **duplicate** existing Facebook Lead Forms directly from the campaign setup interface.

### **Accessing Form Review & Mapping details**

1. When selecting a lead form inside the **Lead Generation** campaign setup, click the **pencil/edit icon** beside the form name (hover text: Map Fields / Duplicate Form).



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043984290/original/PsMXalvmzTcGEgessOa2U5JKw7adarfGzA.png?1742978398)
2. A modal opens allowing you to:
   - **Preview the form content**
   - **Map or update** form fields to CRM fields
   - **Ensure lead syncing is accurate and complete**

* * *

### **Duplicating a Facebook Form**

From the same modal, you’ll now see a **"Duplicate Form"** button at the bottom left. Clicking it opens a new view with all the fields pre-filled based on the original form.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043984481/original/DqaJ-Oe3HkNKHooDQlWmdtrAKpGUIaZBag.png?1742978515)

- You can make any edits to the cloned version.
- Once satisfied, click **Create Form** to save it as a new Lead Form.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043984491/original/IR1zCKhtGkw5hzqHKqQNn0pGOAejCi-_QA.png?1742978528)

* * *

### **Field Mapping Prompt**

To prevent missed data syncing, if the selected form hasn’t been mapped yet, a message will now appear just below the form selector:

```
“Form fields of the selected form are not mapped, map now.”
```

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043984703/original/tJTn7ymBgdRzIsTyV4YHGJwbbFtsxaQ8ow.png?1742978622)

Clicking **“map now”** will directly open the review modal to complete the field mapping process with your CRM fields.
