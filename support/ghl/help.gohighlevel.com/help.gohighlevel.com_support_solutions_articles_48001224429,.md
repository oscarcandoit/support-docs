## **How to Set Up Assessments in a Membership Course**

Follow these steps to create and publish assessments in your course. You can choose where to place the quiz and customize it with questions and scoring rules.

### **Navigating to the Products Tab Under Memberships**

To create assessments or quizzes, begin by navigating to Memberships on the left-side menu. Then, from the top dropdown under Courses, select Products. This takes you to the product (course) library where you can create or edit existing membership courses.

### **Viewing Your Membership Products**

Once you're in the Products tab, you’ll see a gallery of all your existing courses. Each product tile includes the course title and member count. Click on any product to start editing or adding assessments.

### **Expanding Course Categories to Add Content**

Inside a course, the Product Structure lets you organize lessons and assessments. Click the small plus icon next to any category or subcategory to add an assessment.

### **Adding an Assessment**

Clicking the plus icon opens a content dropdown. Select Add Assessment to create a new assignment or quiz inside the selected category.

### **Choosing Assessment Type**

In the "Add Assessment" popup, you must provide a Title and choose between two types: Assignment or Quiz. This step defines the nature of the evaluation tool you're adding.

```
Important: Choose Quiz to test knowledge with auto-graded questions. Choose Assignment when you need learners to upload files or complete open-ended tasks.
```

### **Managing Assessment Settings and Visibility**

Once created, the assessment appears in your content list. You can change its status (Published, Draft, Locked), edit it, or delete it using the action icons next to the title.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044472240/original/fE1cGBFqmPy-7aC48mutEstWjzZv6BfFpg.png?1743681902)

### **Assignment Editor: Upload Instructions and Templates**

Once you’ve clicked the small pencil icon (Edit Button), you’ll be directed to the assignment editor where you can configure the content and settings. Start by giving your assignment a **title**, which will be displayed to learners. If the assignment doesn’t require grading, you can enable the **Ungraded Assignment** checkbox to allow submissions without evaluation. You can upload a **thumbnail image** to visually represent the assignment—this is especially helpful for branding or content recognition.

In the **Instructions** section, add clear guidance to help learners understand what is expected in their submission. Use formatting tools to emphasize important information or include hyperlinks to relevant resources. The **Upload Templates** area allows you to upload supporting documents or starter files (.docx, .pdf, .pptx, etc.) that students can use to complete the assignment. Finally, use the **Confirmation Message** field to customize the message learners see after submitting their work. This can be a motivational note, next steps, or simply a thank-you message to reinforce the completion. These tools work together to create a more engaging and informative assignment experience within your membership product.

### **Quiz Editor: Setup and Customization Options**

After selecting **Quiz** as the assessment type, you’ll be taken to the **quiz configuration editor**, where you can build and customize the entire quiz experience. Begin by entering a **Quiz Title**, which will be visible to learners. If you want to assess learner performance, enable the checkbox for **“This quiz requires passing grade”** and enter the required **Passing Grade** percentage to define what qualifies as a successful completion.

You can enhance the quiz visually by uploading a **Quiz Thumbnail** image—this gives learners a branded or themed visual cue for the quiz. Below that, use the **Pass Confirmation Message** and **Fail Confirmation Message** fields to write personalized feedback that learners will see based on their performance. These editors support text formatting, links, and embedded content, so you can include detailed guidance, encouragement, or even resource links.

Once the setup is complete, click on the **Add Question** button to begin building your quiz. You can add multiple types of questions—single-choice or multiple-choice—and configure each with correct answers and optional explanations. This editor controls both the learner interface and how performance is tracked, making it a crucial step in designing effective assessments for your course.

### **Save, Draft, and Publish Options**

After editing, manage the visibility of your assignment or quiz using the top-right buttons: Draft, Preview, Save, or Delete. Remember to Save all changes before exiting.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044472479/original/Qi7TaeJtqL0NBMXOPsEztBiffXfiqAVM7A.png?1743681981)

## **What Happens When Someone Submits a Quiz?**

Understanding the post-submission behavior helps you manage the learner experience. Based on how the quiz is configured, learners will receive different feedback.

**If Passing Grade is enabled:** Learners see their score, which answers were correct/incorrect—but not the correct answer itself.

**If Passing Grade is disabled:** They will also see the correct answer and any explanations added.

Learners can review their previous submission and retake the quiz if needed. This helps reinforce learning or improve performance.

## **How to Analyze Assessment Results**

CSV exports let you take raw quiz data offline for deeper analysis, sharing, or custom reporting. The export respects any filters you’ve applied, so be sure to set date ranges, product filters, or pass/fail status before downloading. To download Assessment Results, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Analytics

Select the **Memberships** tab from the left-hand navigation bar. Then from the top navigation ribbon, click the **Courses** dropdown and select **Analytics**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058581526/original/JnoS2_htzsSv4cweD09FjEwvc2XW4tRB6Q.png?1763402236)

#### **Step 2:** Select Assessments

Select **Assessments** to view assessments results.

#### **Step 3:** Apply Filters

Apply the filters to filter information based on the **Product** or **Assessment Result**(Processing, Passed, Failed).

You can click the eye icon next to any row to view individual answers and scores.

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058581845/original/eelOZovVgCmpf7Nj8_zmBOFo_FG8G28sbw.png?1763402580)**

#### **Step 4:** Export Report

Click the **Export** button in the upper-right corner to export the report. Selected filters will be applied to the exported report. There are 2 ways this report is exported based on data set size:

- Small data sets (≤ 500 rows) download instantly in your browser.

- Large data sets (> 500 rows) trigger an email titled “Your HighLevel Assessment Export is Ready” with a secure 24-hour link to avoid browser time-outs. The link expires after 24 hours for security.

```
Note: Only users with Admin or Instructor roles can see the Export button.
```
