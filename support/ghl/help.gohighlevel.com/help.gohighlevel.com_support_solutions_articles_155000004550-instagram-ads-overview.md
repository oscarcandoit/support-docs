## **How is using Instagram ads along with Facebook ads beneficial?**

Using **Instagram ads** alongside **Facebook ads** allows businesses to reach a broader, more diverse audience by leveraging the unique strengths of each platform. Instagram targets a younger, visually-driven audience, while Facebook has a broader age range. Combining both maximises visibility and engagement through different ad formats, such as Stories on Instagram and Carousel Ads on Facebook.

The cross-platform targeting enables retargeting, increasing conversion opportunities, and the unified Ad Manager makes campaign management and analytics more efficient. Overall, using both platforms enhances **audience reach**, **engagement**, and **ad performance**.

## **How can I connect Instagram account with Facebook page?**

Below is the step-by-step guide to Connect Your Instagram Account to a Facebook Page to run ad campaigns. To run ads on Instagram via Ad Manager, you must connect your Instagram Business Account to your Facebook Page. Once the Instagram account is connected to Facebook page, it will automatically be selected whenever the Facebook page is chosen to publish an ad. **This setup is to be done from the Meta platform.**

### **Step 1:** Switch to an Instagram Business or Creator Account

```
Note: Skip this step if your Instagram is already a Business Account.
```

- Open Instagram App and go to your profile.
- Tap the ☰ Menu (top right) to land on Settings and activity.
- Scroll down and tap Account type and tools → Switch to professional account.
- Choose Business (recommended for ads) or Creator.
- Select your Business Category (e.g., E-commerce, Health & Wellness).
- Tap Next, and follow the prompts to complete the setup.

### **Step 2:** Connect Instagram to Your Facebook Page

**A:** Via Facebook Page Settings (Recommended)

- Go to Facebook and open your Business Page.
- Click Settings (left sidebar).
- Select Linked Accounts → Instagram.
- Click Connect Account and log in to your Instagram account.
- Ensure the option Allow Access to Messages & Connected Experiences is enabled.
- Click Confirm to complete the connection.

## **How to Publish ads on Instagram?**

On the Ad Manager home page, click on 'Create Campaign' and proceed to create a Meta Ad campaign. Below are the steps to create an ad campaign using Instagram as placement:

1. Select a desired Facebook page (default Facebook page will be selected and can be changed)
2. Select the Instagram account you want to use to publish ad. There will be two cases while selecting an Instagram account:

**A:** If no Instagram account is connected to the selected Facebook page, user can select "Use Facebook page" from the Instagram account dropdown and your Instagram ad will use the name, profile picture and other details from your Facebook Page.

**B:** If user already has an Instagram account linked to the selected Facebook page, then that account gets automatically selected and will be used to publish ad campaign on Instagram.

3. All the placements of Instagram are shown in the manual placement section and user can select the ones which they want as their ad placement. When the placements are Auto, all are selected for Instagram.

## **Reporting of Instagram ads**

Like Facebook ads, performance metrics for Instagram ads will be available in HL Ad Manager shortly after your Instagram ads begin running. Instagram ads will use the same reporting tools i.e. the statistics section that Facebook ads use and combined metrics are shown. You'll be able to look at the metrics at the overall and individual campaign level.

Learn more about Ad Manager Statistics using this [help article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003631-statistics-of-ad-campaigns-in-ad-manager).

## **How to delink an Instagram account from a Facebook page?**

User connects an Instagram Business account; when they do so, that particular Instagram account gets linked to the FB page and every time the Facebook page is used to publish ads, we see the Instagram account automatically selected. Now, considering the fact that user wants to delink this Instagram account from the connected Facebook page and connect it to a different page.

One can do so by referring the following help article by Meta: [Connect or disconnect an Instagram account and your Page](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/898752960195806)
