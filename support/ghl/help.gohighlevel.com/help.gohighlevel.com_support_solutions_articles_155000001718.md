# **What is Automatic Abandoned Cart Checkout Email?**

A**utomatic abandoned checkout email** is triggered when a customer adds items to their shopping cart, begins the checkout process, enters their email address, but doesn’t complete the purchase. The system detects this incomplete action and automatically sends a follow-up email to encourage the customer to return and finish the checkout.

This feature is enabled **by default** and operates silently in the background, helping store owners **recover abandoned revenue** without any manual effort.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Abandoned Checkout Emails**

- **Sales Recovery:** Convert lost opportunities into sales by re-engaging customers who dropped off.

- **Fully Automated:** Once enabled, the system tracks and sends emails without any manual setup.

- **Customizable Messaging:** Tailor the email content to match your brand voice and cart value.

- **Dynamic Product Display:** Showcase the exact products left in the cart, increasing emotional reattachment.

* * *

## **How to Access and Configure Abandoned Checkout Notifications**

All settings related to abandoned cart emails are found at the **Sub-Account level**. Here’s how to access and configure them:

### **Open Payments Settings**

To begin configuring your abandoned checkout emails, go to the Payments section in the left-hand navigation menu of your Sub-Account. This is where all eCommerce-related settings, including checkout notifications, are managed.

### **Settings Tab**

Once inside the Payments section, click on the **Settings** tab at the top to manage notifications. This brings you to the configuration panel where you can set up abandoned cart emails and other order-related automations.

### **Navigate to Notifications**

In the Settings panel, select **Notifications** from the left-hand menu. This opens the configuration area where you can manage abandoned cart alerts and other automated email communications.

### **Enable Abandoned Cart Emails**

Toggle on **Enable Abandoned Cart emails** to activate automated reminders for customers who leave checkout without completing their purchase. This is the first step toward recovering lost sales through email follow-ups.

### **Select Email Template**

Choose an email template from the dropdown to define the layout and content of your abandoned cart email. You can use the default or link a custom template designed in the Email Builder.

### **Set Email Subject**

Enter a subject line that will appear in the customer’s inbox when the abandoned cart email is sent. Use a friendly, action-driven phrase to encourage the customer to complete their purchase.

### **Set Email Delay**

Use the “Send after” option to define how long the system should wait before sending the abandoned cart email. You can choose the delay in hours or minutes based on your follow-up strategy.

## **Customizing the Abandoned Checkout Email**

To maximize the impact of your follow-up emails, customize both **the design** and **the content**. Here are two key ways to do this:

### **Override the Default Email Template**

HighLevel includes a basic abandoned checkout email, but you can make yours more engaging with a custom template.

### **Open Email Templates**

Navigate to **Marketing → Emails → Templates** to create or edit the email that will be used for abandoned checkout reminders. This is where you can design a branded, personalized message using the Email Builder.

### **Use the Templates Tab**

Click on the **Templates** tab within Email Marketing to view all your saved email designs. This is where you’ll select or create the template used for your abandoned cart notification.

### **Create or Select a Template**

Click the **\+ New** button to build a fresh email template, or choose an existing one from the list by clicking its name. These templates can be linked to your abandoned cart notification to deliver a customized message.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050814014/original/fvxZ5xaTv0uaRGZmZiqUeQBMCBBXhmCxMQ.png?1754065538)

### **Add Custom Values**

Click the **custom value icon** in the email editor toolbar to insert eCommerce fields like {{ ecom\_checkout\_page\_url }}. This allows the email to link directly to the customer’s abandoned cart or product list.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050814045/original/BOCBQ5BEuv4BY-0KFTHFecYPJm9mv6Zn3Q.png?1754065575)

### **Insert eCommerce Links**

From the custom value menu, select **Ecommerce** to access dynamic fields specific to your online store. This includes options like the checkout page URL and product list page URL for abandoned cart recovery.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050814075/original/t4oz8ZCsuf8ZcNbO5QIdT_JwY1P8iduodw.png?1754065613)

### **Add Checkout and Product Links**

Choose between **Checkout page URL** or **Product list page** to insert dynamic links in your email. These guide customers back to either their abandoned cart or your store’s full product catalog.

### **Add Dynamic Cart Display with Shopping Cart Element**

Make your emails more personalized by displaying the **exact items left in the cart** — including product images, names, prices, and quantities.

**How to do it:**

- In the email builder, locate the **Shopping Cart** element under eCommerce elements

- Drag and drop it into your email layout

- The element auto-populates with cart contents (if the customer reached the checkout page)


### **Use Shopping Cart Element**

Drag the **Shopping Cart** element into your email layout to automatically display the customer’s abandoned products. This adds a personalized, visual touch by showing item names, prices, and quantities directly in the email.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050814190/original/nMpiGFw-DmyEmpB0lJ-4eQLY5XVufJjdXA.png?1754065712)

> ? _Note:_ This works only if the system has captured the cart data — typically when the user reaches the checkout page and provides an email address.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can I disable abandoned checkout emails?**

Yes. Go to **Payments → Settings → Notifications** in your Sub-Account and toggle the email off.

**Q. What happens if the customer doesn’t provide their email?**

No notification is sent. The system requires an email address to trigger abandoned cart recovery.

**Q. Can I adjust when the email is sent?**

Yes. The default delay is 10 hours, but you can modify it from the same notification settings panel.

**Q. Can I send multiple abandoned cart reminders?**

Currently, HighLevel supports only one automated abandoned checkout notification per cart abandonment.

**Q. Can I use SMS instead of email for abandoned checkout?**

Not by default — the system is designed to send emails. You could set up a custom workflow to send SMS manually or as part of an automation.
