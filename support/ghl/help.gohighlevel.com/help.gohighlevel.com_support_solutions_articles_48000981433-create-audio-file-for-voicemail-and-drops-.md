# **What is a Custom Voicemail**

The system has pre-recorded messages and it can do speech to text. A custom voicemail is where you record your own audio and upload the file. This file can be played instead of a system file as your voicemail message or it can be used in voicemail drops where you leave a message in someone else's voicemail (usually a customer).

## **Record Audio Online**

Google "record mp3 online" or try one of these websites:

- [https://www.rev.com/onlinevoicerecorder](https://www.rev.com/onlinevoicerecorder)
- [https://recordmp3online.com/](https://recordmp3online.com/)

* * *

## **Adjust Audio Quality Online**

Bring the quality of the audio down to what works for all carriers. Search for "online audio converter" or try one of these websites:

- [https://online-audio-converter.com/](https://online-audio-converter.com/)
- [https://onlineaudioconverter.com/](https://onlineaudioconverter.com/)

Select the smallest / economy / 64 kbps option.
