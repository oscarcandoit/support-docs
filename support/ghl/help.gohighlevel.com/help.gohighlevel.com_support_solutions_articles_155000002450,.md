## **Blog Post Editor**

There are a lot of controls in the Blog Post Editor but you don't have to learn all of them to publish a new Blog Post.

1. **Auto-Save**: Make sure to toggle Auto-Save on (in the upper right next to the Back button).

2. **Text**: Write and format your article.

3. **Title**: Give the article a meaningful title.

4. **Save and Continue**: Save manually and when you're done click Continue.

* * *

## **Advanced Options**

To enrich your Blog Post's text you can add hyperlinks and multimedia.

1. Add **Hyperlinks** by highlighting some text and clicking the **chain icon** in the toolbar. Then enter the URL, configuration, and click Add Link.

2. Add **Images** by clicking the cursor at the target location then clicking the **image icon** in the toolbar. You can insert an image using a **URL**, the **Media Library**, or creating a new one with **Image AI**.

3. Add **Audio** by clicking the **headphones icon** in the toolbar. Select the audio file from the Media Library, configure, and click Insert Audio.

4. Add **Video** by clicking the **video camera icon** in the toolbar. You can add video from the Media Library or Youtube, configure it, then click Insert Video.

* * *

## **Content AI**

If you don't want to write the new Blog Post from scratch, you can use Content AI to get you started. Click the Content AI button, configure it, and start writing.

* * *

## **Publish & SEO**

When you're done writing your new post you can click Continue, which takes you to the post Status and SEO metadata page. Again, you don't have to learn everything on this page to publish your new Post.

1. **Status**: The post can be in Draft, Publish (today or in the past), or Schedule (in the future) mode.

2. **Record Keeping**: Give the post a URL slug, Category, Author, and Keywords so your overall Blog is well organized.

3. **SEO**: Set your Post's Title, Alt text, Cover Image, and Description. Preview all the changes.

4. **Done**: When everything is configured, click the button in the upper right. It will be Draft, Publish, or Schedule depending on the Status you selected.
