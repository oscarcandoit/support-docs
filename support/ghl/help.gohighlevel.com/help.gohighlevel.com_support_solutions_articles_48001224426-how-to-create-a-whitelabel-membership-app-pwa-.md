# **What is a Whitelabel Membership PWA?**

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web-based application that provides a mobile app-like experience without requiring users to download it from an app store. HighLevel's Whitelabel Membership PWA allows businesses to customize the look, branding, and functionality of their membership site while maintaining full control over content and user experience.

Unlike native mobile apps, PWAs are accessed through a web browser and can be installed directly onto a user's device without going through Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This makes them a flexible and cost-effective alternative for businesses wanting to offer an app-like experience without the complexity of native app development.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using a Whitelabel Membership PWA**

- **Works Across All Devices:** Accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop without separate development.

- **Offline Access:** Users can access previously loaded content even when offline.

- **SEO Benefits:** PWAs are indexable by search engines, improving discoverability.

- **Faster Load Times:** Optimized performance for a smooth user experience.

* * *

## **Why You Should Consider Creating a PWA : Key Differences**

| Feature | PWA | Native Mobile App |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installation | Installed via browser, no app store required | Downloaded from App Store/Google Play |
| Updates | Automatically updated when refreshed | Requires manual updates via app stores |
| Offline Capability | Limited offline access with cached content | Full offline functionality |
| Push Notifications | Supported on Android (limited on iOS) | Fully supported |
| Performance | Fast and lightweight | Generally faster for complex apps |
| Approval Process | No app store approval required | Subject to App Store/Google Play guidelines |

* * *

## **Prerequisites: Prepare Your Membership and Branding**

Before configuring your Membership PWA, it’s important to ensure your branding and membership structure are set up correctly. This foundation improves your user’s experience and makes your PWA feel polished and professional.

**Customize Your Branding:** Go to Memberships > Settings > Branding. Upload your business logo, choose your color scheme, and add a favicon for browser tab branding. These visual elements appear throughout the app and reinforce your brand identity.

**Set Up Your Membership Structure:** Navigate to Memberships > Products. Create product tiers, add courses, and configure pricing and access levels. Organizing your content now ensures a smooth learning journey inside the PWA.

**Link a Custom Domain (Optional):** Connect a custom domain (e.g., app.yourbrand.com) via Settings > Domains. Adding a branded domain enhances trust and gives your PWA a more polished, app-like experience.

Once these steps are complete, you’re ready to begin configuring your Membership PWA.

## **How to Set Up Your Whitelabel Membership PWA**

### **Access Memberships**

To begin setting up your Membership PWA, navigate to the Memberships section in the left-hand menu, then use the top navigation bar to go to Courses > Settings. This will open the Membership Settings area, where you’ll find key configuration options.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043790988/original/Jw_NBG-BSTHD4Pr_3QhBnvoaUZbm9u2adA.png?1742714853)

### **Select App Settings**

Once you’ve navigated to Courses > Settings, you’ll land on the main configuration page for your memberships. From here, look for the App Settings tile. This is where you’ll customize how your Progressive Web App (PWA) appears and behaves on both desktop and mobile devices.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043790991/original/xDipl4dNfcTNskX1LzA_GSVxyZljptM94w.png?1742714874)

### **Enable PWA Installation**

Enabling PWA installation allows your users to “install” your app on their devices just like a native app, improving accessibility and engagement. Once enabled, users visiting your PWA on compatible browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge) will see an installation option or prompt.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043790999/original/47KSfeV99d_O7408PxXFpmpJvPdKCnzi2A.png?1742714903)

### **Customize Your PWA Settings**

Once you’ve toggled Enable PWA to “on” inside the App Settings area, you’ll unlock a set of configuration fields that define how your PWA appears and behaves. This is where the real customization begins—giving your app its name, identity, and look.

**App Name, Short Name & Description**

These fields shape how your app is presented to users across devices:

**Name:** This is your full app name, shown during installation prompts and in the app title bar.

**Short Name:** A shortened version of your app name that appears on home screens or in tighter display areas (e.g., app folders).

**Description:** A brief sentence that tells users what your app is about. It’s helpful context, especially when users are installing your PWA from the browser prompt.

**App Icon**

You’ll need to upload two icons—a larger (512x512) and smaller (192x192) version. These are used across different devices and platforms, such as splash screens, app drawers, and home screens. While the system will automatically choose which icon to use based on screen size, we recommend uploading versions that match each dimension exactly. Icons must be in .jpg or .png format, and they should be visually identical to maintain brand consistency.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043791026/original/LeloYP5WvL80RZy5Mfks-XLr05u7e8MxQQ.png?1742714981)

**App Colors**

HighLevel offers a selection of predefined color palettes for your app theme. These colors affect the styling of UI elements like buttons and headers. You can’t manually enter custom hex codes right now, but the palette choices are designed for strong contrast and visual clarity across devices. Just click to select the one that best fits your brand.

**Save Your Settings**

After you’ve entered your app details, uploaded icons, and chosen your theme color, make sure to click Save in the upper-right corner. If you don’t save, none of your changes will apply when users try to install your PWA.

* * *

**Installing PWA on a Windows Computer:**

After you are done customizing and enabling your Memberships WPA, all that is needed to be done by your client is for them to click on this icon in their Browser Address Bar in **Chrome, when logging in to your Memberships Login Portal:**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48261426288/original/MbJoVwLdImX7MlCkuaUrRXz-474N0gpvdQ.png?1667582738)

And it would allow them to access your WPA on their desktop as a shortcut:

* * *

**Installing PWA on a Mac Computer:**

Once your PWA configurations are complete and PWA is enabled, only using a Chrome browser your clients would be able to download the Memberships PWA by clicking here when logging in to your Memberships Login Portal:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48261435611/original/p4ATAFL_gbARRLkJuKIPjBtPuF03iwQa1Q.png?1667586436)

* * *

### **Installing PWA on an Android Mobile device:**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I still submit my PWA to the App Store?**

Yes, but you’ll need to package it as a native wrapper using tools like PWABuilder or Capacitor.

**Q: Does my PWA work offline?**

Yes, but only for previously loaded content. A full offline experience requires advanced caching strategies.

**Q: Can I send push notifications with a PWA?**

Push notifications work on Android but have limited support on iOS.

**Q: Do I need a developer to set up a whitelabel PWA?**

No, HighLevel's interface makes it easy to configure without coding skills.
