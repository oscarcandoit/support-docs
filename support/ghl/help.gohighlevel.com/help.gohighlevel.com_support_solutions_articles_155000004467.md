# A. Making Shipping Details Hidden, Optional or Mandatory

This section provides a step-by-step guide to help store owners customize the **Shipping Details** section on their Ecommerce store's checkout page by making fields **Hidden**, **Optional**, or **Mandatory**.

* * *

## Why Customize Shipping Details in Checkout?

Customizing the Shipping Details section allows you to:

- Enable faster checkouts by asking for only relevant information.
- Simplify the customer experience to improve conversion rates.
- Meet the specific requirements for shipping rate calculations or live rates integration with platforms like **Shippo**.

* * *

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1\. Access the Checkout Page Editor

1. Go to your **Sites > Stores > Select your Store**.
2. Select Edit the **Checkout Page** for editing.

### 2\. Select the Checkout Element

1. Click on the **Checkout element** within the page editor.
2. This will open the settings menu on the right side of the screen.

### 3\. Navigate to the Advanced Settings

1. In the settings menu, locate and click on the **Advanced Section**.
2. Look for the **Form Options** subsection.

### 4\. Customize the Fields

1. In the **Form Options**, you’ll see a list of fields under the Shipping Details section:
   - Phone Number
   - Address
   - Country/State
   - City
   - Zip/Postal Code
2. For each field, you can choose its status from the dropdown menu:
   - **Hidden**: The field will not appear on the checkout page.
   - **Optional**: The field will be visible but not required to complete the checkout.
   - **Mandatory**: The field will be required to proceed with the checkout.

### 5\. Save and Publish

1. Once you’ve customized the fields to your preference, click **Save**.
2. Publish the changes to apply them to your live store.

* * *

## Key Considerations

### 1\. Impact on Shipping Rates

- Some shipping carriers calculate rates based on specific fields like **Address**, **City**, and **Zip/Postal Code**. Ensure all necessary fields are retained as **Mandatory** if you rely on accurate shipping rate calculations.

### 2\. Live Rates Compatibility

- If you’re using multi-carrier platforms like **Shippo**, all fields need to be completed by customers to retrieve live shipping rates.

### 3\. Faster Checkout Process

- Reducing the number of mandatory fields can streamline the checkout experience for your customers, encouraging higher conversion rates.

* * *

## FAQs

### Q1: Can I customize fields for specific products or categories?

No, this feature customizes the Shipping Details section globally for the checkout page.

### Q2: What happens if I hide a field?

Hidden fields will not appear to customers on the checkout page, and no data will be collected for those fields.
