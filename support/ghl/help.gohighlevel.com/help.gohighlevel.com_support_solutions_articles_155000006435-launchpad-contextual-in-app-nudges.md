# **What are Contextual In-App Nudges?**

Contextual In-App Nudges (for LaunchPad) is a dynamic feature designed to detect when users stall during onboarding or activation flows. By automatically displaying targeted nudges that include useful links to support articles, tutorial videos, kickoff call scheduling, and Chat with Support AI, the feature provides on-demand assistance that empowers users to progress effortlessly through important actions.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Contextual In-App Nudges**

This feature is crafted to enhance the user experience by reducing friction and delivering help at just the right moment. Its benefits include:

- Reducing onboarding friction by offering immediate, context-sensitive support.

- Driving higher action completions on LaunchPad, which contributes to improved trial-to-paid conversions.

- Providing personalized assistance through dynamic links that directly address where users are stuck.

- Enhancing overall user satisfaction by streamlining the onboarding process with minimal interruption.


* * *

## **Dynamic Contextual Link Options**

Dynamic Contextual Link Options integrate multiple support resources into one seamless nudge, ensuring that users find the exact help they need without leaving their workflow. This approach optimizes self-service by connecting users directly to relevant assistance.

- Support Article – Directly opens detailed documentation for in-depth guidance.

- Tutorial Video – Offers visual, step-by-step instructions for a more intuitive learning process.

- Kickoff/Implementation Call Link – Simplifies scheduling of personalized implementation or strategy sessions.

- Chat with Support AI – Provides real-time interactive support to quickly resolve issues.

## **Automatic Nudge Suppression**

Automatic Nudge Suppression refines the user experience by eliminating redundant prompts. When any user within a sub-account successfully completes a particular action, all contextual nudges for that action are automatically suppressed for everyone in the sub-account. This smart function minimizes distractions and ensures that nudges only appear when truly needed.

## **Example Contextual In-App Nudges**

Getting started with Contextual In-App Nudges is straightforward since the feature is automatically rolled out on a going-forward basis for all plans. Follow these steps to observe and benefit from the feature in your HighLevel account:

1. Log in to your HighLevel account and navigate to the LaunchPad section.

2. Begin an onboarding action—whether that’s starting a guided tour, watching a tutorial, or engaging with a flow.

3. When you pause, abandon, or linger during an action, a contextual nudge will appear featuring one or more dynamic links.
