# How to Customize Your Prospect Report Layout

Modified on: Tue, 15 Apr, 2025 at 4:53 AM

You can now personalize the structure of your Prospect Reports by selecting which sections to include and defining the order they appear in. This guide walks you through how to manage **Global Layout Settings** as well as make **one-off changes** for individual reports.

**Guide on how to do customize report layout:**

1. [Global Report Layout (Default for All Future Reports](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005053-how-to-customize-your-prospect-report-layout#Global-Report-Layout-(Default-for-All-Future-Reports))

# **Global Report Layout** (Default for All Future Reports)

Global layout settings apply to **all new and existing reports** created after your changes are saved.

### Steps:

1. **Go to Settings:** Navigate to the Prospecting section in your left-hand menu.

2. **Open Report Settings:** Click on Report Settings, then select Customize Report Layout.

3. **Adjust Section Visibility**

   - By default, all sections are included.

   - Uncheck any sections you do **not** want to include in your reports.
4. **Reorder Sections**

   - Use drag-and-drop to change the order of the sections.

   - This helps you define the narrative flow that makes the most sense for your agency and clients.
5. **Save Your Layout**

   - Once you're done customizing, click **Save**.

   - These settings will apply to **all future and existing Prospect Reports** by default.

   - You can change the settings again anytime, and include/exclude any section

# **Customizing Layout for a Specific Report Only**

If you want to tailor a single report—for a specific prospect or use case—you can do that without affecting your global settings.

### Steps:

1. **Open any Report:** Navigate to the Prospect Report you’d like to customize.

2. **Access Section Controls**

In the top-right corner of the report, click on the **"Sections"** button.

3. **Customize as Needed**

   - Drag and drop sections to reorder them.

   - Check or uncheck sections to include or exclude them from this particular report.
4. **Save Changes**

These layout changes will apply **only to this report** (and this prospect).

Your global layout settings will remain unaffected.
