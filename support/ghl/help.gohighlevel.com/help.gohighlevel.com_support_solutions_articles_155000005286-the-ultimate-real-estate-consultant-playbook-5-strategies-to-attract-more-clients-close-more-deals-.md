## Why This Playbook Matters

You're great at selling homes, navigating negotiations, and closing deals—but staying top-of-mind with buyers and sellers takes more than just hustle.

Here’s the reality:

✅ 97% of homebuyers begin their search online.

✅ 75% of real estate leads go to the agent who follows up first.

✅ Referrals drive 50%+ of business for top-performing agents.

If you’re not showing up in local searches, automating your follow-ups, or collecting reviews, you’re losing listings to competitors who are.

This playbook shows you how to set up HighLevel step-by-step to automate your lead generation, follow-ups, social media, and reviews—so your brand works even while you’re at a showing.

## Step 1: Get Found Online with Google & Local SEO

If you're not showing up in the top results, your competitors are.

✅ 85% of homebuyers use Google to find agents.

✅ Agents with 50+ Google reviews get 300% more inbound calls.

### What To Do First

If you're not listed, you're invisible. Set it up to appear in "real estate consultant near me" searches.

✅ **Add Your Target Markets as Service Areas**

Include neighborhoods, zip codes, and cities.

✅ **Use a Call Tracking Number**

Swap your number with a HighLevel tracking number to monitor which listings and sources generate leads.

✅ **Automate Review Requests After Every Closing**

Build credibility by collecting consistent Google and Facebook reviews.

✅ **Post Weekly on GBP**

Highlight recently sold homes, client wins, or open house events.
