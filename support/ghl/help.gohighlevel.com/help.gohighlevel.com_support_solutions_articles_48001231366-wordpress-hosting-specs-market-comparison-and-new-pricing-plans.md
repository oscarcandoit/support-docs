# WordPress Hosting: Specs, Market Comparison, and New Pricing Plans

Modified on: Mon, 14 Jul, 2025 at 10:53 AM

At the heart of our CRM, we've integrated a comprehensive WordPress hosting solution designed to simplify website management while delivering top-notch performance. Whether you’re setting up your first site or managing multiple clients, our hosting service has you covered with robust features, fast speeds, and reliable support.

What Our WordPress Hosting Offers:

- **All-in-One Website Setup and Management:** Get everything you need to build, launch, and manage your WordPress sites effortlessly

- **Blazing Fast Speeds:** Utilize our global CDN network to ensure rapid page loading times for your visitors.

- **Unmatched Uptime and Security:** Rest easy with automatic backups and security protocols that keep your site safe and running smoothly.

- **Manual Backup Flexibility:** In addition to automatic backups, create manual backups anytime you need.
- **24/7 Expert Support:** Our dedicated support team is here around the clock to help with any issues

```
All WordPress Hosting plans are in addition to the HighLevel plan. For example, the lowest tier would be HighLevel Starter ($97/mo) + WordPress Standard ($10/mo) = $107/mo and for that you get all of the marketing automation features of HighLevel and 1 WordPress site with all of the features and support.
