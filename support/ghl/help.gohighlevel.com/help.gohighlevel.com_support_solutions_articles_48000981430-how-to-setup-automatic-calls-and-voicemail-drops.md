Click on "+ **Create Workflow**."

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035413228/original/7pQt9biMkNvBRJF_PPIz6oNeEEl1cB_wnw.png?1729857765)

Click on " + **Start from scratch."**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035413281/original/Jz40ejD47ekj6Js_oYER7fxCZnWVZ9YDvw.png?1729857796)**

Select a workflow trigger for your call /voicemail drop action. In this example, we have used "Contact Changed" trigger.

To add the workflow action, click **"+"** button

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035402488/original/UqreaGPzLJAjduU1cTmHji7LDIUdvq5NZA.jpeg?1729850573)

You can either scroll down or search for "Assign to User" action. Click on " **Assign to User."**

#### **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035413050/original/BZdwLy-70MR1Zvd3OcjytwhUvjdAAl1nKQ.jpeg?1729857672)**

#### **Users**

Select user from the drop down menu If you want the calls to go to a dedicated team member (See  [assigned user's phone number configured](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001152124-phone-numbers-for-users-assign-twilio-numbers-to-users).)

If no one is assigned, the calls will go to the phone number you have saved in your business profile as a company phone number. (see  [Inbound Call Routing - Explained](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000981432).)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035412395/original/Ig0TBuIY_tjSdhuHE86IoskvVe79OVHgKA.png?1729857232)

**Only Apply To Unassigned Contacts**

In the previous step, we choose the team member who will be automatically assigned all the new contacts that enters into this workflow.

Now this toggle option gives you the ability to decide weather you want to assign the newly added contacts to the same user even if the contact is already assigned to any of the team member before it entered into this workflow or you want to stop assigning such contacts.

**Save Action**

Don't forget to **Save action** before you go back to the workflow builder page.

**Call Whisper**

You can modify the Call whisper message here:

By default, the call whisper states, **"You have a new lead, John Smith. Press any button to connect"**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035413386/original/DIUhE5q_TeBTuFr2LGpjI44ntHWwgDlFfw.jpeg?1729857878)

**Voicemail Detection**

When the lead can't answer the call, you will hear this message: "Couldn't connect with the lead," and the call ends. You can't leave a personalized voicemail if this occurs.

To leave a personalized voicemail with our Call event, go to the settings of the call step, and you can turn on " **Disable Voicemail Detection."**

**Connect Call After Keypress**

Use this toggle if you want to connect the call only after a user press any key.

3\. Upload back to HighLevel voicemail campaign/workflow

### **Are voicemail drops legal?**

Voicemail drops are legal as long as you have the user's consent before dropping the voicemail. Else they are illegal. The TCPA applies to ringless voicemail drops because they are considered a form of communication that uses an automated dialing system and a prerecorded message. Therefore, you need to have prior express consent from the recipients before sending them ringless voicemail drops. Otherwise, you may face lawsuits and fines from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or private parties.

### **Why am I not able to drop more Voicemails?**

Voicemail drop limits ramp up as you spend more time with us.

Day 1: 100 drops per day

Day 2: 200 drops per day

Day 3: 300 drops per day ...

Day 7: 700 drops per day

Day 7 onwards: 2000 drops per day

If you would like to increase these limits, please reach out to our support team.

**Do I need any extra registration or verification before sending ringless voicemail drops?**

If you already have an LC phone number (or Twilio number) set up in your sub-account and have obtained prior express consent from your contacts, you can start sending ringless voicemail drops right away. No additional legal registration is required beyond compliance with the **TCPA** and other applicable laws in your region. However, always confirm that your business is following local telemarketing regulations, as requirements may vary.

**TLDR; Voicemail drops rely on a carrier trick, this is how all voicemail drops work, and as a result they only work about 70% of the time.**
