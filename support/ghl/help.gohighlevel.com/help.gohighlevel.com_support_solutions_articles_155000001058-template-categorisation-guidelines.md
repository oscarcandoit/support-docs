- Templates where contents are unclear (e.g., contents are only “{{1}}” or “Congratulations!”).

> **Note: Examples are illustrative only, templates containing similar content or content including this example text may be categorized differently based on their exact content.**

* * *

## **Utility templates**

Utility templates are typically triggered by a user action or request. They must include specificity about the active or ongoing transaction, account, subscription or interaction to which they relate. For example, an order confirmation must contain an order number.

| Message Objective | Business Goal | Example Templates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opt-In Management on WhatsApp | Confirm opt-in for receiving messages on WhatsApp as a follow-up to opt-in collected via other channels (e.g., website, email). Also confirm opt-out. | - "Thanks for confirming opt-in! You’re in. You’ll now receive notifications via WhatsApp."<br>- "Thank you for confirming your opt-out preference. You will no longer receive messages from us on WhatsApp." |
| Order Management | Confirm, update, or cancel an order or transaction with a customer using specific order or transaction details in the body of your message. | - "Thank you! Your order {{1}} is confirmed. We will let you know once your package is on its way."<br>- "Hooray! Your package from order {{1}} is on its way. Your tracking number is {{2}} and expected delivery date is {{3}}."<br>- "Unfortunately, one item from your order {{1}} is backordered. We will follow up with an estimated ship date. If you wish to cancel and receive a refund, please click here: {{2}}"<br>- "We have received your item from order {{1}}. Your refund for {{2}} has been processed. Thank you for your business." |
| Account Alerts or Updates | Send important account updates, including time-sensitive alerts, safety information, payment reminders, and other information relevant to already-purchased or subscribed products and services.<br>These messages should not intend to upsell or cross-sell new products or services. | - "Daily update for account ending in {{1}}: Your balance is {{2}}."<br>- "Reminder: Your monthly payment for your subscription to {{1}} will be billed on {{2}} to the card you have saved on file."<br>- "To finish setting up your profile, you need to upload a photo. Please click here to upload: {{1}}."<br>- "The product you ordered {{1}} on {{2}} has been recalled. Please click here {{3}} to learn more."<br>- "There is a tornado alert in your area. We recommend you remain indoors until {{1}} o'clock today." |
| Feedback Surveys | Collect feedback on previous orders, interactions or ongoing relationships with customers.<br>These messages should not be about requesting feedback related to potential upsell or cross-sell opportunities. | - "We have delivered your order {{1}}! Please let us know if there was any issue by reaching out here: {{2}}."<br>- "Your feedback ensures we continually improve. Please click here {{1}} to share your thoughts on your recent visit at our {{2}} location. Thank you in advance!"<br>- "You chatted with us online recently about order {{1}}. How was your experience? Click to fill out a short survey: {{2}}." |
| Continue a Conversation on WhatsApp | Send a message to start an interaction on WhatsApp that began in another channel.<br>These messages should not be initiated without a user having requested the conversation to be moved to WhatsApp. | - "Hi! I see you requested support via our online chat. I am the virtual assistant on WhatsApp. How can I help?"<br>- "Hi {{1}}, we are following up on your call with customer service on {{2}}. Your case has progressed to the next step. Please log into your account to continue: {{3}}." |

> **Note: Examples are illustrative only, templates containing similar content or content including this example text may be categorized differently based on their exact content.**

## **\[To be Released\] Authentication templates**

Authentication templates enable businesses to authenticate users with one-time passcodes (usually 4-8 digit alphanumeric codes), potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).

Authentication templates are our most restricted. For a template to be classified as authentication, a business must:

1. Use WhatsApp’s preset authentication message templates, which include optional add-ons like security disclaimers and expiry warnings
2. Configure a one-time password button (copy-code or one-tap)
3. Follow content restrictions: URLs, media, and emojis are not allowed for authentication template content or parameters. Additional length restrictions of 15 characters also apply to parameters.

| Definition | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication code | - "{{1}} is your verification code."<br>- "{{1}} is your verification code. For your security, do not share this code."<br>- "{{1}} is your verification code. This code expires in 15 minutes." |

## **FAQs**

## How can we assign a category to a template?

When you create a message template, you select the category you believe applies, based on the template category guidelines outlined above. We then determine the template’s category, based on the template contents and these same guidelines. If we agree with the category you designated, we set the template status to PENDING (it then goes through template review to ensure it is in compliance with our policies. If we disagree, we set it to REJECTED.

For creating a template please refer to the documentation below:

```
How to create a WhatsApp Template?
```

## What are WhatsApp message templates?

WhatsApp message templates are pre-approved messages businesses use to communicate with customers outside the 24-hour messaging window. They ensure consistent, structured, and policy-compliant messaging.

## How do I assign the correct category to a WhatsApp template?

When creating a template, you must select one of the three categories based on the message’s purpose:

Marketing – Promotional messages, offers, and customer engagement.

Utility – Order confirmations, payment reminders, and account updates.

Authentication – One-time passcodes (OTP) for account verification and login security.

WhatsApp reviews and finalizes the category based on content. If misclassified, the template may be rejected and need revision.

## What happens if my template is categorized incorrectly?

If WhatsApp determines the category you selected is incorrect, your template will be rejected. You will need to revise and resubmit it under the correct category.

## What types of messages fall under Marketing Templates?

Marketing templates are the **most flexible** and include:

- Promotional offers and discounts
- Event invitations and announcements
- Retargeting messages (e.g., abandoned cart reminders)
- App promotions and referral programs

**Example:**

_"You left something in your cart! Complete your purchase here: {{1}}."_

```
Note: Templates with mixed content (e.g., order updates with a promo) are also considered Marketing.
```

* * *

## What qualifies as a Utility Template?

Utility templates provide customer-requested updates and transactional messages such as:

- Order confirmations and tracking updates
- Payment and subscription reminders
- Account alerts and security notifications

Example:

_"Your package from order {{1}} is out for delivery. Track it here: {{2}}."_

Note: Utility templates cannot contain promotions, upsells, or sales-related content.

* * *

## What are Authentication Templates used for?

Authentication templates are strictly for user verification and must:

- Contain only an OTP (one-time passcode).
- Follow WhatsApp’s preset authentication template format.
- Not include URLs, media, emojis, or promotional content.

Example:

_"{{1}} is your verification code. Do not share this code."_

* * *

## Can I mix content from different categories in one template?

No, templates should be clear and specific to one category. A Utility template that includes a promotional message will be categorized as Marketing and may be rejected if misclassified.

* * *

## What happens if my template is rejected?

If your template is rejected, it means:

- It may have violated WhatsApp’s policies.
- The content did not match the selected category.

You can edit and resubmit the template after correcting the issue.

* * *

## How can I ensure my template gets approved quickly?

✔ Choose the correct category based on the content.

✔ Ensure the message is clear and contains all necessary details.

✔ Follow WhatsApp’s guidelines to avoid rejection.

For detailed instructions, refer to \[How to Create a WhatsApp Template?\](Insert Link Here).

## Where can I find more information or request support?
