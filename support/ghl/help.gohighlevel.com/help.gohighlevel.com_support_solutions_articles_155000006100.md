# Workflow AI Builder

Modified on: Mon, 13 Oct, 2025 at 8:00 AM

Workflow AI builder enables you to create workflows by simply describing what you want to automate in plain English or any other language of your choice. Instead of manually configuring triggers and actions, just type your automation goals and let AI generate the entire workflow structure for you.

# Getting Started

## Entry Points

There are three ways to access the workflow AI builder:

#### **1\. From the Workflow List Page**

Navigate to**Automation > Workflows**and click the**"Build using AI"**button. This opens a modal where you can enter your prompt.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142424/original/zKPlaFFDskxV0AsvGkN-5p03BXGg5L2pQg.png?1759470867)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142459/original/SShgtARbdVXePR_AYg2YhZRjfALlQx19sA.png?1759470897)

#### **2\. From the Prompt Box Inside Workflow Builder**

When creating a new workflow from scratch, you'll find an AI prompt box directly above the**"Add Trigger"**button in the workflow builder. Simply type your automation requirements here.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142512/original/-2ci5qK1KPosg7LcHa7ywNMxchVwATE6Mg.png?1759470978)

#### **3\. Using the AI Chatbot Assistant**

Inside the workflow builder, you can also use the AI chatbot assistant to help build your workflow.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142535/original/DwDcruh8MMYMnjkNS17Rgp6Xx122qeS_3g.png?1759471023)

## How to Build Your First AI Workflow

#### **Step 1: Enter Your Prompt**

Enter your prompt in any of the entry points mentioned above, or ask the chatbot to help build a workflow.

#### You have two options to get started:

1. Write your own custom prompt - Describe your automation needs in your own words

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055143193/original/tcXXRD22nG4ziiNtKOFzLwH5yQOMmaH5ZQ.png?1759471986)

        2.Use the provided templates - Select from pre-written prompt templates available in the interface

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142796/original/kPHEAhJb_FR6ZBf03QWFdqovygq_jkXaVw.png?1759471427)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142811/original/xqbopLTDqkvScSWAMU9w4DOp4T6l066aUg.png?1759471444)

#### Here are some example prompts you can use:

- "Send a welcome email series when someone fills out my contact form"
- "Create a birthday reminder workflow that sends SMS greetings"
- "Notify my team on Slack when a high-value opportunity is created"
- "Follow up with webinar attendees 24 hours after the event"

#### **Step 2: Generate the Workflow**

Click "Build Workflow" button or hit Send (depending on your entry point). You'll see a loader while AI processes your request and builds the workflow.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055142837/original/y7JgKdDfHRoaAODfK9MqJSw4RRPHKY6SNQ.png?1759471506)

#### **Step 3: Review and Customize**

Once the AI completes building your workflow you will get the summary of the workflow created as well apart from the automation:

- If you used entry point 1, you'll be taken to the workflow builder
- If you used entry points 2 or 3, the workflow will be generated directly in your current builder view

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055143442/original/PZy1hnmsieR2mqRdGLgupkeufS0rB8EXaA.png?1759472293)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055143456/original/gFVeEWos3VMuIGHQQcn0nfhGIPi-CpXmjQ.png?1759472330)

You can then:

- Review the overall workflow structure
- Check individual trigger configurations
- Verify action settings and parameters

#### **Step 4: Edit Using AI**

After reviewing your workflow, you can make changes using natural language through the AI chatbot. Simply describe what you want to change, and the AI will update your workflow accordingly.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055144540/original/86l5N88DMiYM-_2Zt3QDF0DAxXdt5e5E6g.png?1759473641)

**What You Can Edit**

The conversational editing feature currently supports:

**Actions:**

- **Add** new actions anywhere in your workflow
- **Remove** unwanted actions (both single and multi-path)
- **Replace** existing actions with different ones
- **Modify** action configurations and settings
- **Move** actions to different positions in the workflow


**Triggers:**

- **Add** additional triggers
- **Remove** existing triggers
- **Replace** triggers with different types
- **Modify** trigger configurations

**Complex Edits:**

- Combine multiple changes in a single prompt.


**Limitations:**

- Modifying configurations inside multi path actions like if/else and wait step with timeout is coming soon.

#### **Example Edit Prompts**

- "Add a 3-day wait between the welcome email and the follow-up"
- "Replace the SMS action with a Slack notification"
- "Remove the last email in the sequence"
- "Move the tag action to happen before sending the first email"
- "Change the trigger from form submission to contact created"
- "Add an if/else condition to check if the contact has made a purchase"

### **Note**: For multi-path deletion, the AI may ask clarifying questions to ensure the changes match your intentions.      **Point and Edit for Precise Control**

For larger workflows where identifying specific actions becomes challenging, use the **Point and Edit** feature for precise control over your edits.

**How to Use Point and Edit:**

**1.Activate Point and Edit Mode**

- Click the "Point and Edit" button in the AI chatbot interface
- Your workflow canvas becomes interactive for selection

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055148050/original/ANVerrTW0TIZIH7-rnnqTSJeeetmTkQs9g.png?1759476491)

**2.** **Select Actions to Edit**

- **Single Selection**: Click on any action to select it
- **Multiple Selection**: Click multiple actions to select them
- **Drag Selection**: Hold Shift and drag to select multiple actions (similar to selecting icons on desktop)
- Selected actions will be highlighted





![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055148094/original/8GehMJ-puT6QzD5KahX7x-7YroK66ZJcyw.png?1759476508)

**3** **.Apply Targeted Edits**

- Once actions are selected, describe your changes in the chatbot
- The AI will apply modifications ONLY to your selected actions
- This prevents unintended changes to other parts of your workflow

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055148121/original/97qZN4SszDF6ka95xror_oWCXPIL6ReIMA.png?1759476542)

**Example Point and Edit Scenarios:**

- Select 3 email actions in a sequence and say "Change all these to SMS messages"
- Select a specific task action and say "Change the text to be more urgent"
- Select multiple actions in a branch and say "Move all of these after the tag action"
- Select a group of actions and say "Delete these selected actions"

**Benefits of Point and Edit:**

- **Precision**: Edit exactly what you want without affecting other parts
- **Visual Clarity**: See what you're editing before making changes
- **Efficiency**: Make bulk changes to multiple selected actions at once
- **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates confusion in complex workflows with similar actions


**Tip**: Point and Edit is especially useful for workflows with 10+ actions or multiple branches where verbal descriptions alone might be ambiguous.

### **Bonus: Chat mode**

**How to Use Chat mode:**

**1.Activate Chat Mode**

- Click the "Chat Mode" button in the AI chatbot interface
- This enables brainstorming and prevents any build from taking place

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055149074/original/noVufQ9GyG5ef2gQ9oXstNQlfjvxvlMzqw.png?1759477034)

**2.** **Brainstorm with AI**

- **Brainstorm first:** Decide what to build and make AI your brainstorming partner
- **Create a plan:** Go back and forth and create a plan for the actions and triggers

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055149108/original/RCloMStLYMCjWWMALAuSk3dPshXr_g5USQ.png?1759477050)

**3**. **Ask AI to build it**

- Once finalised, disable chat mode
- Then ask AI to create it

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055149127/original/i9bZAdOgepgINy9cgvEUNbCr3V2zJ-bV2A.png?1759477058)

# Best Practices for Effective Prompts

#### **Be Specific and Clear**

The more detailed your description, the better the AI can understand your needs.

**Good Example:**"When a contact books an appointment, wait 24 hours, then send them a confirmation email with appointment details and a reminder SMS one day before the appointment"

**Less Effective:**"Send appointment reminders"

#### **Include Key Details**

- **Timing**: Specify when actions should occur
- **Channels**: Mention email, SMS, or other communication methods
- **Conditions**: Include any filters or criteria
- **Content** **Type**: Describe what kind of messages to send

#### **Use Action Words**

Start with verbs that clearly indicate what you want to happen:

- "Send..."
- "Notify..."
- "Create..."
- "Update..."
- "Wait..."
- "Check if..."

# Providing Feedback

Your feedback helps improve the AI builder.

#### **Using the Feedback Chatbot**

1. A chatbot automatically opens when your workflow is created
2. Click ? (thumbs up) if the workflow meets your expectations
3. Click ? (thumbs down) if improvements are needed
4. Provide detailed feedback in the text box that appears
5. Share specific suggestions for enhancement

#### **What to Include in Feedback**

- Whether the workflow matched your intended automation
- Any missing triggers or actions
- Incorrect configurations you noticed
- Suggestions for improvement

# Beta Limitations

- **Manual Review Required**: Always check trigger and action configurations before activating
- **Configuration Verification:** Some complex configurations including filtermay need manual involvement
- **Multi-path Modifications**: Complex multi-path action modifications will be supported in later release
- **Testing:** AI cannot test your workflows as of now, will require manual testing.

### **Troubleshooting**

If Your Workflow Isn't Generated Correctly

#### **Refine Your Prompt**

- Add more specific details
- Break complex workflows into simpler descriptions
- #### Use clearer action words


#### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue**: Workflow has wrong trigger

**Solution**: Specify the exact trigger type in your prompt (e.g., "When a form is submitted" vs "When a contact is created") or just edit using AI

**Issue**: Missing actions

**Solution**: List all desired actions explicitly in your prompt or edit using AI

**Issue**: Incorrect timing

**Solution**: Use specific time references (e.g., "after 2 days" instead of "later")

# Quick Tips

- Start with simple workflows to understand AI capabilities
- Build on top of simple workflows with increasing complexity
- Always test workflows before publishing
- Provide feedback to help improve the system
- Check back regularly for new features and improvements
- As with any early-stage AI product, AI doesn’t always get it right. When this does happen, we encourage you to give feedback so we can continuously improve.
