* * *

### **How to Use It**

1. In your workflow, add the action: `Add Leads under an Affiliate`

2. Choose your assignment method:

   - **Manual**

   - **Auto (Attribution)**

   - **Custom Mapping**
3. Configure additional fields based on the method

4. Save and publish the workflow


### **Assignment Methods**

1\. Manual : Manually assign a lead to a known affiliate in a specific campaign.

**Best for:** Form submissions, internal routing, admin decisions.

**Steps:**

- Select campaign
- Select affiliate (from affiliates in that campaign)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051076579/original/zf9NeSIstbZrgaKC3kFkK7sZO1-uHeZmgQ.jpeg?1754542880)

2\. Auto (Attribution via URL) : Automatically assign leads using `am_id` passed in the **URL parameters**.

Supports **first** or **last click** attribution.

**Steps:**

- Choose Attribution Method: First / Last
- Make sure `am_id` is passed earlier in the funnel (e.g., form/page URL)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051076580/original/63YI_YvbtgPN_nWrRSsPLBAqqOBx6Bdw4A.jpeg?1754542880)

3\. Custom Mapping : Use if `am_id` is stored in a **custom field** or passed as a workflow value.

**Best for:** API pushes, third-party systems, hidden fields on forms.

**Steps:**

- Choose mapping source: custom field or workflow value
- System reads value and assigns the lead to the matching affiliate![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051076581/original/dAQymuHR9BhRgNu6cyn3hx96MgmIXtnDXw.jpeg?1754542881)
