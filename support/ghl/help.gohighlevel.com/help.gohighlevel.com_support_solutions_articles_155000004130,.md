### **Why Payments Fail**

Payment transactions may fail for a variety of reasons, including:

- **Insufficient funds**
- **Incorrect card details** (such as an expired card or incorrect CVV)
- **Bank restrictions** or **security flags**

When this happens, you’ll see a notification prompting you to retry the payment.

### **Retrying Your Payment**

1. **Go to the Product Page**

   - Visit the Product which you want to subscribe.
   - Submit your credentials to make payment
2. **Click “Retry Payment”**

   - On the Purchase page, locate the "Retry Payment" button.
   - Click on it to re-initiate the payment process.

**3\. Update Payment Information if Needed**

- If the failure was due to incorrect or outdated card information, you’ll be prompted to enter new details.
- Double-check all information before proceeding to ensure the payment goes through successfully.


**4\. Confirm Payment**

- After updating your details, confirm the payment.
- You should receive a success notification once your payment is accepted.

### **Common Solutions for Successful Payment**

- **Check with your bank** to ensure there are no restrictions on the card being used.
- **Verify funds are available** in the account.
- **Consider alternative payment methods** if the retry option is still not successful.


### **Still Having Trouble?**

If your payment still isn’t going through, feel free to reach out to our Support Team for assistance. We’re here to help you complete your purchase!
