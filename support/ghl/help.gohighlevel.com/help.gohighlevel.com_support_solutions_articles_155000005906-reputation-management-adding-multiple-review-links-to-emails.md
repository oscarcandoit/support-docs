# **What is the Multiple Review Links Feature?**

This new Reputation Management feature lets you add multiple review links (like Google, Facebook, and others) directly into your email templates. It automatically pulls in all your connected review platforms and gives you easy options to customize the text, order, and visibility of each link.

By showing several review destinations in one email, customers can choose the platform they prefer—making it easier for them to leave a review and boosting your chances of getting more responses.

## **Key Benefits of Multiple Review Links Feature**

These benefits focus on driving more completed reviews with less manual effort while keeping your messaging on brand.

- **Brand choice:** Give customers multiple platforms to pick from, meeting them where they already are.

- **Higher conversions:** Reduce drop-off by removing the “wrong platform” dead end.

- **Flexible copy:** Customize the link text to match your brand voice and call to action.

- **Fewer mistakes:** Auto-validation helps catch malformed or incorrect URLs before sending.

- **Simple control:** Reorder, hide/unhide, or delete links without changing your integrations.
