# Triggers - Overview

Modified on: Mon, 4 Mar, 2024 at 12:26 AM

## **Note**: Now that Workflows are live in all accounts, you can do everything that Triggers and Campaigns do (and more!), all in one builder! [Click to learn more about Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001179678-workflow-builder-overview).

Triggers are conditional statements (similar to Zaps in Zapier) that connect all the different modules of HighLevel together. Think of triggers as the wiring or 'secret sauce' in the back-end making all the cool things HighLevel does actually happen.

_Example:_

Let's say you have set up a Zap in Zapier to push leads into a HighLevel campaign when they fill out a form embedded in a ClickFunnels landing page. You also want to send an SMS notification to your client to let them know when this happens (the equivalent to letting them know they have a new lead)

How would we do this?

**Answer**: Set up a trigger!

2. Click + New Basic Rule
