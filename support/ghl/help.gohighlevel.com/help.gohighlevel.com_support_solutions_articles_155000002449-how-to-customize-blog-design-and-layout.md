## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I customize or edit the “Next” and “Previous” buttons shown on the Blog Home page?**

The “Next” and “Previous” buttons are auto-generated for blog pagination and can’t be edited directly in the blog editor. You can style or hide them using custom CSS under the Advanced tab, but the text and structure cannot be changed from inside the editor.
