# Getting Started with Gift Cards

Modified on: Fri, 21 Nov, 2025 at 9:37 AM

**Gift Cards** are a powerful new way to engage your customers, boost sales, and build loyalty — all within your existing payments ecosystem. With fully customizable Gift Card Products, you can design and sell beautiful, branded digital cards that reflect your business identity. From choosing artwork and denominations to setting expiry dates and terms, you have complete control over how your Gift Cards look and function.

Whether customers are purchasing a gift for someone special or you’re rewarding loyal clients with complimentary credit, Gift Cards make every transaction more personal. They can be sold through a dedicated checkout or embedded on your website, shared through a QR code, or sent directly to contacts with a custom message. Every card issued is automatically tracked under **Gift Card Orders**, giving you clear visibility into balance, status, and redemption — while offering your customers a seamless, delightful way to pay.

## Overview

Gift Cards give your business a powerful way to drive sales, reward loyal customers and simplify promotions. With this feature you can create branded Gift Card Products, sell or send them, and track every issued card in a dedicated **Gift Card Orders** page — all from inside your **Payments** section.

This guide walks you through what the feature does, how to set it up, and how your customers redeem their cards.

* * *

## What can you do with Gift Cards?

With Gift Cards you can:

- **Create Gift Card Products** with your branding, denominations, expiry dates and more.

- **Sell Gift Cards** from a dedicated checkout, embedded on your site, or via QR code.

- **Send Gift Cards directly** to contacts without collecting payment (great for promotions or service recovery).

- **Track every issued card** from the **Gift Card Orders** page with status, balance, and details.

- **Let customers redeem Gift Cards seamlessly** at supported checkouts with automatic balance display and fallback payment collection when needed.


* * *

## What Do I Need to Use This Feature?

- Access to **Payments → Gift Cards** in your account.

- At least one Gift Card Product created.

- Active checkouts (Forms, Funnels, Payment Links, Invoices, Store, Calendars etc.) to support redemption.

- (Optional) Artwork and terms & conditions for your Gift Card branding.

**Tips:**

- You can edit, archive, or deactivate a Gift Card Product at any time.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058726115/original/E9FMjOaRip6g9vVnJ3g1l069W49Xim8tAw.png?1763546586)

- When deactivated, the sell link stops working and you cannot send new Gift Cards for that product.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058726137/original/9ywFJOb8g8km6TMixQEUw7It_znoGIhN0Q.png?1763546601)

6. One of the methods can be chosen and their visibility depending on the availability of Email address and phone number of the contact.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058726379/original/-lt7U_VwN9LJkFnrUC-WhO6HHYpuzFXmIQ.png?1763546779)

9. Click **Send**.


**Result:** A free Gift Card is issued to the contact — ideal for loyalty, refunds, or special campaigns. This will appear in **Gift Card Orders** but not in the general **Payments → Orders** page (since no payment occurred).

* * *

## How to Track Gift Card Orders

All issued Gift Cards (whether sold or sent) are listed under **Payments → Gift Cards → Gift Card Orders**.

The gift card orders page lists all the sold or sent gift cards along with their statuses, balances, filters and contact details. All cards on this page are clickable and open up a detailed page for that order.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058727985/original/MiqnSulsGtG2CoQfRGkeU_jICA8dlJpXFQ.png?1763547579)

The gift card order details page acts as the single source of truth for all Gift Cards in the account. For each Gift Card Order, businesses can view:

\- Purchaser info

\- Recipient info

\- Denomination

\- Expiry date (same as that of the gift card product)

\- Remaining balance

\- Status (Scheduled, Active, Inactive)

\- Hidden Gift Card number (visible inside the order details page)

\- Delivery method and delivery schedule

\- Transaction reference (for paid cards)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058728028/original/2mSXrbv1vG6Evv2co0jTxjqkPk05XKV9cw.png?1763547604)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058728089/original/Lp46iTBA7uomzzVZB7LOaoVfEaxiYc1mbA.png?1763547617)

**Important:**

- The generic **Payments → Orders** page only shows paid orders. Gift Cards sent directly without payment do **not** appear there.

- The **Gift Card Orders** page is your central hub for every card issued or purchased.


* * *

## How Customers Redeem Gift Cards

1. Customer goes to any supported checkout (Forms, Funnels, Payment Links, Invoices, Store, Calendar (if applicable), etc.).

2. Enters their Gift Card Code in the Gift Card field.

3. The balance displays automatically.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058728376/original/1W3uX7UCRPze92xeJ-uFrK0io20wF064sQ.png?1763547714)

**Redemption Rules:**

- If balance ≥ order total for one-time products: no extra payment needed.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058728435/original/PvuNZ3kPqO8utHgvJZqgXifebzbEJTVmDQ.png?1763547764)

- If balance < order total or includes subscriptions: checkout captures an additional payment method for the remainder.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058728415/original/vJOLkROU2t8pRQ4TkbI85JQDLrSYPvddAQ.png?1763547745)

- Transaction details now show a separate line item for “Gift Card Balance Used.”

### **Gift Card Dashboard (Overview)**

The Gift Card Dashboard gives you a quick snapshot of your overall gift card performance. You can view high-level metrics such as:

- **Total Gift Cards Issued** (sold + sent)

- **Total Value of Gift Cards Issued** for the selected time period

- **Average Gift Card Order Value** for the selected time period

- **Number of Unique Customers** who purchased or received gift cards in the selected time period

These insights help you understand customer behavior, track gift card adoption, and plan better inventory or promotional strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What’s the difference between Gift Card Orders and the regular Orders page?**

A: Gift Card Orders (inside Payments → Gift Cards) track every card issued or purchased. The generic Orders page only records paid transactions.

**Q: Which payment providers can I redeem**

A: Not yet. All Gift Card Orders for a product share the product’s expiry. Order-level validity is planned for a future release.

**Q: Can I set different expiry dates per order?**

A: Not yet. All Gift Card Orders for a product share the product’s expiry. Order-level validity is planned for a future release.

**Q: How does inventory work with multiple denominations?**

A: Inventory applies per denomination. For example, three denominations with inventory of 50 each = 150 total cards.

**Q: Can I restrict where Gift Cards are redeemable?**

A: As of MVP, Gift Cards are redeemable on all products. More fine-grained controls (product-level, variant-level) are coming soon.

**Q: Can customers check their balance without starting checkout?**

A: Not yet. For now, entering the card number at any supported checkout displays the balance. A dedicated balance-check link is coming soon.
