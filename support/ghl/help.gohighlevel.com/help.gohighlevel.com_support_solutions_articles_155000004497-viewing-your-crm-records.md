You can view your CRM records in a tabular format with multiple options to filter, sort and even decide what columns you are seeing at any point in time.

This view is currently accesible from Contacts (currently in Labs), Opportunities (through a toggle), Custom Objects, Companies and Tasks.

1. For all CRM objects, this is the default view that you see when go to that object from the left or the top bar menu.

2. For Opportunities, navigate to your Opportunities section and switch to the List View from the top right toggle.

## Feature List:

This makes it easier to scan through and find the information you need quickly.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040014123/original/DL6X51UbDz2vwfqCjJxW2fH9B_HWfx5NDw.jpeg?1737112306)

## Benefits of the List View

The List View offers several key advantages that can enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow:

- **Enhanced Visibility:** With more data displayed in the same view, you can get a comprehensive look without having to switch between screens.
- **Increased Customization:** Tailor your columns to display the information that matters most to you. This customization ensures that your view is always aligned with your specific needs and preferences.
- **Improved Efficiency:** By enabling sorting, filtering, and exporting directly from the list view, you can manage your records more efficiently, saving time and reducing the effort needed to perform routine tasks.
