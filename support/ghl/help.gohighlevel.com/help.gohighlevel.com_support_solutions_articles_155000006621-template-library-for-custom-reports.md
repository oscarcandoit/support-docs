# **What is the Custom Reports Template Library?**

The Custom Reports Template Library is an in‑app gallery of professionally designed report layouts for **Reporting › Custom Reports**. Instead of building from scratch, you can start with a template, tailor branding, and schedule PDFs or emails. Templates help agencies enforce design standards and accelerate client reporting.

The library appears when creating a new custom report. From there, you can browse, preview, and apply a template so the full report opens with pages, widgets, and themes preconfigured.

## **Key Benefits of the Custom Reports Template Library**

Using templates ensures consistency and speed while reducing setup errors. The benefits below focus on outcomes that matter to agencies and client‑facing teams.

- **Brand consistency:** Keep fonts, colors, and layout uniform across clients.

- **Faster Report Creation:** Build and deploy new reports in minutes using ready-made templates.

- **Proven Best Practices:** Each template is designed by data and business experts to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

- **Continuous Updates:** Access a growing library as new templates are added regularly based on industry trends and user feedback.

- **Customization Flexibility:** Every component—metrics, filters, visuals, and layouts—can be edited to fit your exact reporting needs.

- **Reduced Learning Curve:** Ideal for users new to reporting or teams standardizing how analytics are built.

- **Time Savings:** Eliminate repetitive setup work and focus on analyzing data instead of formatting it.

## **Adding a Custom Report to the Template Library**

Converting a finished, reusable report into a template lets every team reuse the same layout and branding. Set the right permissions first, then upload the report as a template so it’s available across sub‑accounts.

**Set minimum access permissions**

1. From **Reporting › Custom Reports**, find your finished report on **Reports Overview**.

2. Click the **⋮ (three dots)** next to the report name and select **Manage permissions**.


Grant at least **Read** access to the following roles: **Agency User**, **Account Admin**, and **Account User**.

**Before you upload — make a template‑ready report**

1. Finalize layout, branding, and page order.

2. Replace any client‑specific text or screenshots with generic copy/placeholders.

3. Normalize **date ranges** and widget settings you want reused.

4. Click on  **⋮ (three dots)** and select Upload Report Template

3. **Filter and select a template:** In the library, filter by **niche** and **tags** to quickly find a suitable layout. Click a template to preview and then **Use Template** to apply it.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:****Will editing a template update reports already created from it?**No. Templates are a starting point. Edits affect **future** reports created from that template; existing or scheduled reports remain unchanged.

**Q:** **Can I hide specific templates from certain sub‑accounts?**You can’t hide a single template directly. Use a **hidden category** and ensure templates you want hidden are not in any visible categories.

**Q:** **Why do numbers sometimes differ between the builder, email preview, and ads widgets?**Timezones. The builder uses your browser timezone; scheduled email previews use the sub‑account’s timezone; connected ad platforms (e.g., Google/Facebook) follow their own account timezones.

**Q: Are images included in downloaded PDFs?** Images and iframes may appear in previews/emails but are not included in downloaded PDFs due to security restrictions.
