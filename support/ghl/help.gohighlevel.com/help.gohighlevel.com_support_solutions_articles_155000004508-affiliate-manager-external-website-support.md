Big News! You can now run affiliate campaigns on any external website—not just GHL websites and funnels. This game-changing update allows your affiliates to promote and sell your products anywhere on the web, giving you more flexibility and reach.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

- [What’s New?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004508-affiliate-manager-external-website-support#What%E2%80%99s-New?)
- [How It Works:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004508-affiliate-manager-external-website-support#How-It-Works%3A)
- [Why it Matters:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004508-affiliate-manager-external-website-support#Why-it-Matters%3A)
- [Important Notes:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004508-affiliate-manager-external-website-support#Important-notes:)

## **What’s New?**

- Support for External Websites: Simply add your external website URL and have affiliates up and running in minutes!

- Universal Tracking: Use one affiliate link to track sales across your entire website, including subdomains.

- Product-Based Commissions: Set up custom commissions for specific products or use default settings for all items sold via your connected Stripe account.

- Recurring Subscriptions: Track upgrades, downgrades, and recurring payments automatically, ensuring affiliates earn commissions on every eligible transaction.


## **How It Works:**

- ## Go to Affiliate Manager and navigate to the Campaigns tab.

- Click +Add to create a new campaign.
- Select "External Website" as the source.
- Enter your website URL to generate an affiliate tracking link.
- Set your default or product-specific commissions, and tier levels if needed.
- Add the tracking script to your external website.
- Publish your campaign and let your affiliates start selling!

## **Why it Matters:**

Your affiliates can sell your products on any website, expanding your marketing reach. With domain-wide tracking and universal links, you can streamline affiliate campaigns, drive more sales, and reward affiliates effortlessly.

## **Important Notes:**

- Only products sold through Stripe are supported for now.

- One-time products will always follow default commission settings.

- Recurring products can have customised commission rates. Just add the products in the first step to configure product based commissions.

- If you want to exclude a product from commissions, simply add it and set the commission to 0%.
