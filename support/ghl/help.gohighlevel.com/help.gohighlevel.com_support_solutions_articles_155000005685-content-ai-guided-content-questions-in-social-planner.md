# What are Guided Content Questions in Social Planner?

Guided content questions are an advanced enhancement to Content AI inside Social Planner that help you create more relevant, targeted content. Instead of relying on generic AI prompts, you’ll now fill out a dynamic, platform-specific form that adapts based on your selected social platform and content type. This ensures your posts are optimized for each channel and perfectly aligned with your brand messaging.

# Key Benefits of Guided Content Questions

Guided content questions improve your content creation process by making it faster, smarter, and more personalized.

- Adaptive experience that automatically adjusts to different platforms (like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) and content types (Post, Reel, etc.).

- More relevant content that matches your chosen goal and message.

- Integrated Brand Voice fields to keep your content on-brand and consistent.

- Streamlined workflow, with required fields shown first and optional fields tucked away until needed.

- Improved engagement, thanks to clearer, more tailored content designed for each platform.


# How to Use Guided Content Questions

Creating content with the new guided experience is simple and intuitive. Here’s how:

1. Navigate to Marketing → Social Planner in your HighLevel account.

2. Click the "\+ New Post" button.

3. From the dropdown, select "Content AI" to open the guided form.

4. Choose your social platform (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) and content type (e.g., Post, Reel).

5. Fill out the mandatory fields, which are always visible. These include key details like your core message, content goal, and call to action.

6. (Optional) Click to expand additional questions for more advanced customization, such as audience nuances, tone preferences, or hashtags.

7. Review and adjust the Brand Voice fields, which are auto-filled to ensure on-brand content — but you can edit these anytime.

8. Once ready, click Generate Content to have AI draft a platform-optimized post for you.

# Tips for Creating High-Impact AI Content

Get the most out of your AI-generated posts by following these best practices:

- Clearly define your key message and goal, so the AI can create a focused and effective post.

- Leverage your Brand Voice settings to ensure tone and style are consistent with your business identity.

- Use the optional fields to add extra context and fine-tune your content for even higher accuracy and relevance.

- Always review the generated content to make final tweaks and ensure it aligns with your campaign strategy.


# Important Notes

Currently, guided content questions are available only through the Content AI option in the "+ New Post" dropdown of Social Planner.

Brand Voice fields are auto-filled whenever possible to save time and ensure consistency, but you can fully customize them before generating content.
