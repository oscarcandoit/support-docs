Schedule your posts in advance for your community groups and channels.

This addition brings streamlined content distribution, scheduling control, and enhanced engagement, allowing users to build stronger, more consistent community interactions through Social Planner.

\- Scheduled Posting: Plan and schedule your content in advance, ensuring posts go live at the optimal time for each community. This helps maintain engagement and ensures your message reaches members at the best times.

Note - Community posting is allowed for CSV and other types of post.

Important points to note ?

\- If there are new Channels or changes to Group/Channel details, it will not auto-populate in Social Planner. The user will have to go to Social Planner Settings > Communities to re-sync the groups and channels.

\- In Post Composer area, there is option to add user on whose name the post will be published. In Social Planner Settings > there will be option to go to Communities > you can select default users who will be used when you create new social post.
