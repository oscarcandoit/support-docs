# Get Discovered: The Real Estate Agent's Guide to Dominating Google Search

Modified on: Wed, 16 Apr, 2025 at 5:49 AM

### **Rank Higher. Generate More Listings. Close More Deals.**

#### **Are You Losing Listings to Agents with Better Online Visibility?**

You're an expert at showcasing properties, negotiating deals, and helping buyers find their dream homes.

But when someone searches "Realtor near me" or "Top agent in \[Your City\]," does your name show up first?

#### **Here’s the reality:**

- 93% of homebuyers start their search online.

- 76% of sellers use the first agent they contact.

- Agents with 40+ Google reviews generate up to 5X more listing leads.


If you're not ranking high on Google, you're losing listings — even if you're the most experienced agent in your market.

### **What If Sellers Found _You_ First Every Time?**

**Imagine:**

- Getting seller inquiries while you're out at a showing.

- Ranking at the top of local search results for "sell my house fast" or "listing agent in \[Your City\]."

- Turning your website into a 24/7 lead-conversion machine.


**This playbook shows you how to**:

- ✅ Rank higher on Google and attract more listings.

- ✅ Use HighLevel to automate reviews, follow-ups, and lead capture.

- ✅ Convert search traffic into booked appointments.


* * *

### **Step 1: Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP)**

#### **Why This Matters:**

70% of real estate searches include a local intent ("realtor near me" or "buy home in Miami"). Your GBP is the first impression you make in those search results.

#### **1.1 Claim & Complete Your GBP**

- Ensure your **NAP** (Name, Address, Phone Number) is consistent with your website and listings.

- Add high-value keywords to your business description: "Luxury Listing Agent in Austin," "First-Time Buyer Specialist," etc.

- List services like:

  - Home Valuation Consultations

  - Buyer Representation

  - Listing Agent Services

  - Virtual Tours & Open Houses

#### [Complete your Business Profile on Google](https://support.google.com/business/answer/10515606?utm_source=HighLevel+HelpDesk&utm_medium=organic)

#### **1.2 Enable Google Messaging + HighLevel Call Tracking**

- Swap your GBP number with a **HighLevel call tracking number**.

- Respond to leads instantly with **HighLevel’s automated text responses**.

- Route inquiries directly into your pipeline.

#### [How to chat with customers from your Business Profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/15013580?utm_source=HighLevel+HelpDesk&utm_medium=organic)

#### **1.3 Automate Your Google Reviews**

- Agents with consistent reviews are 3X more likely to win listing appointments.

- HighLevel can:

  - Automatically send review requests via SMS/email.

  - Remind happy clients to leave 5-star reviews post-closing.

#### **1.4 Post Weekly to Your Google Business Profile**

- Share new listings, price drops, open house schedules.

- Use HighLevel's **social planner** to automate GBP posts.

### **Step 2: Optimize Your Website for SEO & Conversions**

#### **Why This Matters:**

88% of online real estate leads bounce if your website is slow or hard to navigate. And 63% of real estate traffic comes from mobile.

#### [Sites Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001633)

#### **2.1 Build a Fast, Mobile-Optimized Website**

- Use HighLevel’s drag-and-drop site builder.

- Include:

  - Clear CTAs ("Book a Free Listing Consultation")

  - Lead forms

  - Appointment calendars

  - Click-to-call buttons

#### [How to Optimize for SEO Meta Data](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000980312)

#### **2.2 Use Local Keyword Optimization**

- Examples:

  - Title Tag: "Top Realtor in Dallas \| Free Home Valuations"

  - Service Pages: "List Your Home in Plano," "Buy a Condo in Uptown Dallas"
- Include service area footers: neighborhoods, zip codes, cities.


#### [Getting Started with Chat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004102)

### **Step 3: Build Local Authority with Backlinks**

#### **Why This Matters:**

The #1 Google ranking factor? Backlinks from trusted sources.

#### **3.1 Get Listed on Local & Niche Directories**

- Sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, Yelp, Angi, and local real estate boards.

- Claim and optimize your profiles.


#### **3.2 Create or Contribute to Real Estate Blogs**

- Topics like:

  - "3 Biggest Mistakes Sellers Make in \[Your City\]"

  - "Is Now the Right Time to Sell in \[Your Neighborhood\]?"
- Link back to your website to build SEO juice.

### **Step 4: Track What’s Working and Improve**

#### Why This Matters:

You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Agents who track source-to-close performance optimize 4X faster than those who don’t.

#### **4.1 Use HighLevel’s Analytics Dashboard**

- Monitor:

  - Calls & form submissions from Google

  - Lead source attribution

  - Keyword rankings

  - Conversion rates

#### **4.2 Tie Leads Back to Revenue**

- Track which listings, pages, and campaigns result in signed agreements.

- Automate follow-ups based on lead behavior (e.g., "Visited Seller Page > No Form Fill = Send Email/SMS Nurture Sequence").
