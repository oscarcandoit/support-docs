# How to reconnect broken Marketplace Apps?

Modified on: Sat, 17 May, 2025 at 6:35 AM

In case developers lose access to access token or refresh token due to any reason - either due to an incident from HighLevel or due to an error on the developer's end - we have provided a solution.

You can now use the **Reconnect API** to get back the authorisation code that can be used in [Get Access Token API](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/00d0c0ecaa369-get-access-token) (OAuth - Authorisation grant flow) to get back a new set of access and refresh tokens.

This enables you to reinstate the connection without having to trouble your users.

For Sub-Account App connections:

```javascript

```

JavaScript

For Agency connections:

```javascript

```

JavaScript

Response of the API:

```javascript

```

JavaScript

```
IMPORTANT: If you are concerned on how do I receive Official Support for HighLevel API-Related Issues or Broken Marketplace Apps? Please visit https://developers.gohighlevel.com/ for API documentations and support.
```
