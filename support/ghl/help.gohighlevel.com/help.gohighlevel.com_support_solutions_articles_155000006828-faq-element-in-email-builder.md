## **What is the FAQ Element in Email Builder?**

The FAQ Element is a drag-and-drop block that lets you organise content in a simple Q&A format. It’s perfect for newsletters, onboarding sequences, product updates, or promotional emails where you want to proactively answer common questions.

Each FAQ item typically includes a question title and a collapsible answer section, allowing recipients to scan for relevant information quickly while keeping your email layout clean and easy to read.

> **Note:** The FAQ Element is a static design block questions and answers are displayed visually (not interactive accordions). It’s optimised for clarity and readability across devices.

- Helps readers find important information quickly.

- Reduces customer support queries by addressing common concerns.

- Keeps your email organised with a structured Q&A layout.

- Easy to customise change colours, fonts, and spacing for a branded look.

- Fully responsive and optimised for both desktop and mobile devices.
