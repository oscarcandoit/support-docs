# Group Chat in the HighLevel Mobile App

Modified on: Thu, 24 Apr, 2025 at 9:10 AM

This article shows you how to use the new Group Chat feature in the HighLevel and LeadConnector mobile apps. Group Chat allows you to start conversations with multiple clients, team members, or stakeholders in one thread — so you can communicate faster, clearer, and more effectively, all from your phone.

# **What is Group Chat?**

**Group Chat is a mobile-first messaging feature that allows users to create a single chat thread with multiple participants.**

Rather than juggling several one-on-one conversations, users can now collaborate with multiple contacts — like families, internal teams, or entire departments — in one unified thread. This streamlines communication, reduces response delays, and improves transparency across all participants.

## **Key Benefits of Group Chat**

**Group Chat transforms how users manage communication by making it faster, collaborative, and more intuitive — directly from the mobile app.**

- **Collaborative Conversations**: Bring multiple contacts into one thread for streamlined discussions.

- **Streamlined Communication**: Keep everyone on the same page without repeating messages across chats.

- **Improved Client Engagement**: Tailor interactions by grouping related contacts (e.g., families, departments, or teams).

- **Mobile-First Convenience**: Start, manage, and continue group conversations anytime, anywhere.

- **Unified Threading**: One thread, all responses — less clutter, more clarity.

- **Better Responsiveness**: Everyone can view and reply to messages in real time.


## **How To Use Group Chat**

**Get started with Group Chat in just a few taps from the HighLevel or LeadConnector mobile app.**

Here’s how to initiate a group thread and collaborate more effectively:

1. **Open the HighLevel or LeadConnector mobile app** on your iOS or Android device.

2. **Tap the “Conversations” tab** at the bottom of your screen.

3. **Tap the floating “+” button** to begin a new conversation.

4. **Choose “Group Chat”** as the conversation type.

5. **Select your phone number** and choose multiple contacts from your list.

6. **Optionally name the group chat**, making it easy to identify later.

7. **Tap “Start Chat”** to launch the conversation instantly.


You can now chat with all selected contacts in one seamless thread!

## **Starting a Group Chat**

**Group Chats are ideal for real-time coordination and updates with multiple contacts.**

Whether you’re onboarding a family, managing a sales team, or supporting multiple decision-makers, creating a group chat ensures everyone stays informed and involved.

## **Managing a Group Chat**

**Once a group chat is live, you can communicate just like you would in a one-on-one chat.**

You can:

- Send and receive messages

- Share images or files

- Tag users by name

- View all participants in the chat


**Note:** Editing group names, adding/removing participants, and setting group permissions are not yet supported in beta but are coming soon in the full rollout.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is Group Chat available on desktop?**

A: Not yet. Group Chat is currently only supported on the mobile apps for HighLevel and LeadConnector (v3.95.0+).

**Q: Can I rename or delete a group chat?**

A: These options will be added in future updates, but they’re not available in the beta release.

**Q: Can I add or remove participants after the chat is created?**

A: Not at this time. This functionality is under development and expected in the full rollout.

**Q: How do notifications work in a group chat?**

A: Notifications are delivered just like one-on-one chats — via mobile push alerts for every new message in the group.

**Q: Are all group chat participants able to see past messages?**

A: Yes. All members of the group can view the complete message history.

- **Request White Label Update**: If you’re using a white-labeled version of the app, request an update to enable Group Chat.
