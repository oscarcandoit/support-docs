# **Where can I configure my app's pricing?**

Log in to your [Marketplace - Developer account](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/), click on your app and select the 'Pricing' option from the left menu.

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034622435/original/xppr0jO6LqPc7JuWCYBN4KN_bAw8tnB5Ng.png?1728892235)**

# **Select payment collection preference**

## **Within the Highlevel platform (Recommended)**

This method permits customers (both agencies and sub-accounts) to pay for the app within the HighLevel platform. We handle the payment processing and ensure timely payouts to developers.

1. Enable agencies to re-sell these apps to their end sub-accounts, enhancing wider adoption and engagement for your app
2. Use granular pricing modules offered by HighLevel Marketplace platform such as free-trials, etc.
3. Streamlined collection and reconciliation of payments.

## **External payment page (Not recommended)**

If you'd rather manage your app's pricing on your platform, choose this option and provide the redirect URL for your external payment page. Customers will get redirected to your payment page during the installation process and upon successful payment the app will be installed in their account.

- Add the redirect URL for the payment page.

**Note:**

- Initially selecting an external payment page allows for later changes to the Highlevel platform. But, once live with internal payment collection, you cannot switch to an external page. Such a change necessitates deleting and recreating the app.
- Agencies cannot resell apps with external payment preference, which reduces your app's adoption chances.

# **What pricing models can I offer?**

Your app can have one of three pricing models, all of which are configurable using Pricing Plans:

1. Free
2. Paid - Subscription
3. Paid - One-time
4. Freemium - Combination of Free and Paid plans

You can optionally offer Free-trials on any of the above pricing models.

# **Adding Pricing Plans**

When opting for a paid model and internal payment collection:

- Navigate to 'Pricing Plans' and select '+ Add Plan'.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034623402/original/VUltaGnAoJ2P8o1sA5Hs4a6ZEF19e-q6vA.png?1728892895)

- Complete the subsequent sections:
  - Payment frequency (One-time or Monthly or Yearly): Set your price per month when billed monthly and yearly.
  - Plan name: Add a name for each plan. Try to structure the names so they have some sort of progression – e.g. 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', and 'Pro'.
  - Plan benefits: Add up to five benefits for each plan. These should show a clear distinction and progression for each plan, with stronger benefits reserved for plans with a higher price.
  - Pricing: Add the price you want to charge for each of your app's plans.
  - Click Add Plan

## **Distribution Types and Pricing Models**

To understand distribution types, [**please refer to this article**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002141-marketplace-app-distribution-type#Summary).

In this section, let's understand how you may customise your distribution type based on who you want to charge.

Let's assume that the agency in the following example has set a flat 5% markup on all Marketplace Apps.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Distribution Model** | **App Pricing Model (with example)** | **Agency pays** | **Sub-account Pays to agency** | **Developer Makes** |
| **Target User: Agency** | Monthly: $50/month | $50/month | - | $50/month |
| One-time: $50 | $50 One-time | - | $50 One-time |
| **Target User: Sub-account \|**<br>**Who can install? : Agency & Sub-account** | Monthly: $10/month | $10/month | $10.5/month | $10/month |
| One-time: $10 | $10 One-time | $10.5 One-time | $10 One-time |
| **Target User: Sub-account \|**<br>**Who can install? : Agency Only** | Monthly: $50/month | $50/month | **-** | $50/month |
| One-time: $50 | $50 One-time | - | $50 One-time |
| **Differential pricing enabled**<br>**_(Monthly)_**<br>Agency Price:$50/month<br>Sub-account Price:<br>$10/month | $50/month<br>+<br>$10/month per sub-account | $10.5/month | **$50/month**<br>**+**<br>**$10/month per sub-account** |
| **Differential pricing enabled**<br>**_(One-Time)_**<br>Agency Price:$50<br>Sub-account Price:<br>$10 | $50 One-time<br>+<br>$10 One-time per sub-account | $10.5 One-time | $50 One-time<br>+<br>$10 One-time per sub-account |

Here's how you setup differential pricing for apps with **Target User: Sub-account \|** **Who can install? : Agency Only:**

**Drive adoption of your app by offering free-trial - full-experience of the app for a limited duration of time.**

**You can offer anywhere between 1 - 90 days of free-trial to your users.**

**Some points to note:**

1. Free trial config is at the app-level, and applies to all pricing plans in your app.
2. A user can avail free trial only once per app within a period of 90 days.
3. Your users will receive a notification a 24 hours before the trial period ends giving them a heads-up about the upcoming charges.
4. In case of payment failures after free-trial, GHL will notify the users and try to charge them again for 3 consecutive days. After 3 consecutive days of payment-failure, the app will be uninstalled from the user's account.
5. You can track free-trial period through [AppInstall webhook](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/889f37581bd0e-o-auth-2-0) and [Get Installed Locations API](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/aeed19d08490e-get-location-where-app-is-installed).

# **Usage-based pricing**

Here's a loom demonstrating the steps to configure Usage-based pricing on your marketplace apps.

# **Monitor Earnings**

## **How your earnings are calculated**

Your revenue stems from app installations on the Highlevel platform. We currently do not deduct any commission. You receive the entire payment from our customers. However, agencies can markup the price when reselling to sub-accounts. For instance:

Say, a Sub-account app is priced as follows:

- Developer Pricing: $10/month
- Agency Resale Price: $12/month

Here's how the resultant transactions when a sub-account installs the app:

- Sub-account Charge: $12/month
- Agency Charge: $10/month
- Developer Earnings: $10/month

## **Earnings Dashboard**

Track your revenue in the 'Earnings Dashboard'. For a live, paid app:

- Total Earnings: Cumulative earnings till date.
- Total Installs: Number of app installations.
- Active Accounts: Current active/installed accounts.
- Use the table below for detailed insights and apply filters as needed.

## **Payout**

We've partnered with Tipalti to facilitate developer payouts, ensuring you have a smooth and efficient transaction process.

### **How Does the Payout Process Work?**

- Developer partners who are eligible for a payout will receive an email invitation to register with Tipalti. This 3-step registration process guides you through everything necessary to ensure compliance and to receive payouts from us.
- After your account is set up and ready, you will begin receiving payouts from Highlevel. The billing cycle is monthly, with payments sent on the 15th of each month for all earnings accrued in the previous month.

If you've already set up Tipalti and your payment status is marked as "submitted," then your payout is in process. Depending on your chosen payout method, you should expect to see the payment within 1-3 days.
