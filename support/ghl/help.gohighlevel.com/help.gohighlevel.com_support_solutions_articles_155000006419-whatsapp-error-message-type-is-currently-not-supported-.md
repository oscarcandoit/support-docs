# WhatsApp Error: “Message type is currently not supported”

Modified on: Wed, 24 Sep, 2025 at 10:18 PM

If you see the error **“Message type is currently not supported”** when sending messages through WhatsApp, it means the message you are trying to send uses a format or media type that WhatsApp’s Business API does not currently support.

* * *

## **Why This Happens**

This error usually occurs in the following situations:

1. **Unsupported Media Type**

   - Trying to send file formats not allowed by WhatsApp (e.g., `.exe`, `.zip`, `.tar`).

   - WhatsApp supports only specific media formats like **images (JPG, PNG), documents (PDF, DOCX), videos (MP4), and audio (AAC, MP3, OGG)**.
2. **Unsupported Message Type**

   - Certain interactive features (like custom unsupported buttons or message structures) are not available.

   - Document messages with captions are currently not supported.

   - Attempting to send **stickers, GIFs, or other unsupported formats**.
3. **Template Restrictions**

   - If you are using a WhatsApp Template, the template body or header might include a type of parameter that is not supported.

* * *

## **How to Fix It**

✅ **Check Media File Format**

- Use only WhatsApp-supported file types:

  - **Images:** JPG, JPEG, PNG

  - **Documents:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT

  - **Audio:** AAC, MP3, OGG

  - **Video:** MP4 (max 16MB)

✅ **Check Message Content**

- Avoid sending stickers, GIFs, or files not supported by WhatsApp.

- Use approved templates for proactive messaging.


✅ **Reconfigure Templates (if used)**

- Ensure the message template is approved and follows Meta’s formatting guidelines.

- Avoid sending messages with unsupported parameters or dangling placeholders.


✅ **Try Sending as a Different Type**

- If the format isn’t supported (e.g., a `.zip` file), upload it somewhere else (like Google Drive) and share the **link** instead.


* * *

## **Example**

❌ Incorrect: Sending a `.zip` file via WhatsApp.

✅ Correct: Upload the `.zip` file to Google Drive and send the download link in your WhatsApp message.

Note: Please refer meta article :  [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/errors/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/errors/)

* * *

## **Summary**

The error **“Message type is currently not supported”** means WhatsApp cannot process the format of the message you are sending. To resolve:

- Stick to supported file types and formats.

- Use approved templates for outbound messaging.

- Avoid unsupported formats like stickers, GIFs, and zipped files.
