# New Discover button - Workflows

Modified on: Wed, 9 Jul, 2025 at 11:58 PM

We’ve made it easier to discover and install marketplace apps directly within the workflow builder. Now, you no longer need to visit the marketplace separately for app installations.

Within the workflow builder, you can view installation options and detailed information about each app through the "Details" tab. This helps you make informed decisions before installing an app.
