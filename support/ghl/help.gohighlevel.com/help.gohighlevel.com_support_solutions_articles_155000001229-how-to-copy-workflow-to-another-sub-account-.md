Now you can easily copy a workflow from one sub-account to another without going through the full "Snapshot" process. Only Agency Admin will be able to Copy Workflow.

### **Copy to Sub-Account**

### **Select Sub-Account**

- Only the sub-accounts that the logged in user has access to will be listed here
- On submit, the workflow will be copied to the selected sub-account
- The workflow copied to other sub-account will be in draft state by default

### **Copy Workflow History**

- The history of workflows copied to another sub-account are listed with current status for each log

### **Copy Workflow History Details** **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010519268/original/d9HUFyhGw5OGjnZXrCyVyVNSYNOtOfqrnQ.png?1697704365)**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010519423/original/GiPLiUp3Ox0fo5TG4fKRr_R-grQ6G_JBpA.png?1697704386)

- If any error while copying, you can debug by clicking on that particular history to view detailed info

### **What happens to the assets while copying workflow?**

The following assets in the workflow will be copied while copying a workflow to another sub-account:

- Contact Tags
- Contact Custom Fields (The field type should be same)
- Sub-Account Custom Values
- Opportunity Custom Fields
- Opportunity Pipelines & stages
- Email/SMS - text templates
- Email builder templates (coming soon)

**Note: All the other assets or references will be cleared/removed from the workflow before copying to the selected sub-account.**
