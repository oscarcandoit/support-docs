# **What is the Branded Mobile App?**

A mobile app is an app in the native app stores for Android (Google) and/or iOS (Apple). A branded app is a live mobile app that has your businesses' logo, colors, knowledge, and more. It connects your clients and customers with your business with just a fingertip.

```
Note:
Custom code is not supported in the Branded Mobile App.
Double check branding and profile details as changers cannot be made after submission.
Remember to check your email for updates.
