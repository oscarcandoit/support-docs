# **What is Forms & Surveys in Funnel & Website Builder?**

Forms & Surveys in HighLevel provides an in‑builder experience for creating, adding, and managing forms or surveys without leaving your funnel or website canvas. Build new forms in a large modal editor, add existing assets with the Form Picker, customize fields and design, and keep everything centrally organized for reuse across funnels, websites, webinars, and e‑commerce stores.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Forms & Surveys in Funnel & Website Builder**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide when to create new assets versus reusing existing ones, how to move faster during page building, and where to manage submissions and performance.

- **Speed inside the builder:** Work in a large, in‑context editor without switching tabs, so you keep momentum while designing pages.

- **Reuse existing assets:** Add any existing form or survey through the **Form Picker**, keeping branding and logic consistent across pages.

- **Template jump‑starts:** Start from curated, theme‑based templates (Application, Contact, Donation, Order, Registration, Request, Subscribe) to avoid building from scratch.

- **One‑click editing:** Drag a form/survey onto the canvas and open the editor instantly to refine fields, styles, and behavior.

- **Unified management:** Every new or added asset is automatically collected in a central list, making it easy to find, duplicate, and reuse.

- **Payments on forms:** Use order‑style templates with the Payment element to sell products or accept donations directly from your form.


* * *

## **Prebuilt Form Templates vs. Themes**

Templates provide ready‑made form structures (e.g., Order or Contact), while **Themes** are visual presets for styling. Choosing the right starting point speeds up build time, and understanding the difference prevents accidental overwrites.

- **Templates (structure):** Application, Contact, Donation, Order, Registration, Request, Subscribe. Customize fields and settings as needed.

- **Themes (visual styles):** Quickly apply a look; note that switching Themes replaces current style changes.

* * *

## **Form Picker**

The Form Picker lets you reuse existing forms or surveys across multiple funnels and websites, keeping experiences consistent and measurable.

- Search, preview, and select any existing asset.

- On selection, you can drag it to the canvas and open **Edit** for one‑click customization.

* * *

## **Unified Management (List View)**

Forms and surveys you create or add are automatically surfaced in a unified list, making it easy to find, duplicate, and reuse across your account’s assets.

- **Single source of truth:** Forms and surveys created from the Funnel or Website Builder also appear under **Sites → Forms → Builder** and **Sites → Surveys → Builder**, and can be selected via the **Form Picker**.

- View all assets, search, and optionally duplicate for variations.

- Keep naming conventions consistent for accurate analytics and reuse.


* * *

## **Design Controls (Right Sidebar)**

The right sidebar of the Form/Survey Builder centralizes design and behavior controls, so you can quickly adjust presentation and advanced settings.

- **Fields:** Add, remove, and reorder fields; map to custom fields where needed.

- **Styles:** Fonts, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and button styles.

- **Advanced:** Confirmation behavior, redirects, logic (survey‑specific), tracking, and other options.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I customize the prebuilt templates?**

Yes. Start from any template, then modify fields, styles, and behaviors in the large in‑builder editor.

**Q: What’s the difference between Templates and Themes?**

Templates are starting structures (e.g., Order, Contact). Themes are visual presets. Switching Themes replaces existing style changes.

**Q: How do I accept payments on a form?**

Use an Order‑style template, add the Payment element, and connect a supported gateway. Configure products in Products, then test before going live.

**Q: Where do submissions and analytics appear?**

View entries under **Sites** **→****Forms → Submissions** or **Sites** **→****Surveys → Submissions**. For performance, open **Analytics** to track conversion and drop‑off.

**Q: Can I convert a form to a survey (or the reverse)?**

Converting types isn’t supported. Duplicate and rebuild in the other format to preserve data integrity.

**Q: Do manual payment methods appear on order forms?**

If enabled in your payment settings, manual methods (like Cash on Delivery) can appear on applicable forms.
