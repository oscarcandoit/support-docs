# Content That Glows Like Glass Skin: The Monthly Social Strategy for Beauty Salons

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 3:35 AM

## **Why Content Still Matters (And Always Will)**

Your clients are scrolling between appointments. Instagram, TikTok, Google, Yelp — it’s all part of the new word-of-mouth. And the salons that show up consistently? They stay top of mind.

But here’s the truth: posting randomly when you remember doesn’t cut it. You need a system — one that’s simple, repeatable, and designed to grow your salon’s brand _and_ bookings.

This playbook gives you that system.

> **91% of beauty clients check a salon’s Instagram or reviews before booking — and 64% say a “strong online vibe” influenced their choice.**

## **Step 1: Choose Your Content Pillars**

Let’s keep it focused. Pick 3–4 main categories of content that you can post every week without burning out.

### Beauty Salon Content Pillars:

1. **Before & Afters** — hair transformations, facials, brows

2. **Behind the Scenes** — staff moments, prep rituals, salon setups

3. **Client Testimonials** — review screenshots, video feedback

4. **Promos & Offers** — limited-time discounts, holiday specials


Optional additions:

- Educational tips (“Why exfoliation matters for glow”)

- Seasonal content (“Spring Hair Trends”)

- UGC reposts (with permission)


Choose 4–5 categories and cycle through them weekly.

* * *

## **Step 2: Build a 30-Day Posting Schedule**

Use this high-converting pattern:

| Day | Content Type |
| --- | --- |
| Mon | Before/After or Testimonial |
| Tue | Tip or Educational Reel |
| Wed | Promo or Special Offer |
| Thu | Behind the Scenes |
| Fri | Client Quote + Call to Book |
| Sat | Trending Sound or UGC |
| Sun | Optional / No Post |

That’s 5–6 posts a week — totally manageable with batching.

You can repeat the same structure next month with fresh visuals.

* * *

## **Step 3: Design Posts That Actually Perform**

### Instagram Feed:

- Use clean backgrounds

- Always include a call to action (CTA)

- Add location tags and relevant hashtags


### Reels:

- Use trending audio with captions on screen

- Start with a hook (“From dull to glow in one facial…”)

- Show transformation within 3 seconds


### Stories:

- Share live bookings, client arrivals, BTS

- Use polls ("Which brow shape would you choose?")

- Add a link sticker to your booking calendar


> **Reels have 2x the reach of regular photo posts — and salons that post Reels 3x/week grow 4x faster on Instagram.**

* * *

## **Step 4: Schedule Everything in Advance**

Inside GHL, use the **Social Planner** to:

- Connect your Facebook and Instagram accounts

- Upload your content calendar

- Preview how your posts will look

- Schedule them weekly or monthly


**[How to Use the Social Planner](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005063-getting-started-setup-social-planner)**

Batch content 1x a week or biweekly. Set it. Forget it. Watch your brand stay visible.

* * *

## **Step 5: Repurpose Like a Pro**

Turn one client story into:

- A feed post (“Jessica’s glow-up after our signature facial”)

- A Reel (video of her before/after)

- A Story with poll (“Would you try this?”)

- A Testimonial graphic for your website or Google review highlight


You don’t need 30 ideas. You need 5 that become 30 assets.

* * *

## **Step 6: Review What’s Working**

Each week, review:

- Most liked/shared posts

- Reels with highest reach

- Booking clicks from IG bio link or Story link stickers

- DMs started from promo posts


This helps you double down on the formats that work.

> **Instagram insights show 3x higher clickthrough rates on stories that include “Book Now” or “Swipe Up” CTAs.**

## **Final Words: Post With Purpose, Not Pressure**

Content should work _for_ you — not drain you.

When your content system runs like clockwork, you stay top of mind, look booked and professional, and attract clients who already feel connected.
