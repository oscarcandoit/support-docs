# Can I use my existing Whatsapp number for registration in Gohighlevel

Modified on: Tue, 21 Oct, 2025 at 1:37 AM

You **can’t directly use your existing personal or business WhatsApp number** to register in GoHighLevel (GHL) unless that number is first **migrated or connected through the WhatsApp Business API** via Meta.

# **When You _Can_ Use Your Existing Number**

You can use your existing WhatsApp number **if all of the following are true:**

- The number is **not currently linked** to WhatsApp Messenger or the WhatsApp Business app

**OR**

- You are willing to **delete your WhatsApp account** from the app to free up the number for API use

- You complete the **GHL WhatsApp API onboarding process**

- Meta successfully **verifies and approves** the number under your **Business Manager (WABA)**


Once connected, your WhatsApp messages will be sent and received **directly inside GHL**.

* * *

# **When You _Can’t_ Use Your Existing Number**

You cannot use your number in GHL

- The number is **still active** on the standard WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business app

- You want to use the same number **both on your phone and in GHL at the same time** — Meta does **not allow** this.


> A number can only be connected to one platform: either the app **or** the API (GHL), not both.


* * *

### **Recommended Options / Workarounds**

**Option 1: Migrate Your Existing Number**

1. **Delete** your WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business account from the phone app.

2. During the GHL WhatsApp API setup, **verify the same number**.

3. Once approved, all WhatsApp messages will now be **managed within GHL**.


> ⚠️ Important: Once the number is connected to the WhatsApp API, you will no longer be able to use it in the mobile app.

* * *

**Option 2: Use a New Number**

- Get a **new phone number** for your WhatsApp API (to use with GHL).

- Keep your **existing WhatsApp number** active on your phone for personal or direct use.


This is often the easiest and safest option if you don’t want to lose access to your current WhatsApp app chats.
