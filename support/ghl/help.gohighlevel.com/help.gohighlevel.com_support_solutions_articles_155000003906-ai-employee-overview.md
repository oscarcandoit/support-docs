There you have enabled the AI Employee. Now you can customize the offering for individual sub accounts based on your clients usage and requirements.

## **Granting/Limiting access to "AI Employee" feature to different sub accounts.**

Now lets see how to manage the access to your Sub-accounts from the "AI Employee" tab.

In order to locate the **"AI Employee"** option, you will need to access agency settings. If you are in one of the sub-accounts then you will first need to **"Switch to Agency View"**. Next, Click **"Settings"** tab located at the bottom left corner. Scroll down for **"AI Employee"** option.

Here you can view the list of your sub accounts in the first column. There is a toggle button next to each sub account for you to enable or disable "AI Employee" option for each individual sub-account.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035253799/original/sIadcL0B3LifC-IJf4ZZ3eyRFpKRWMZNRA.png?1729680384)

You can also choose to enable or disable rebilling for each sub-account and set the rebelling amount. Enabling the toggle will open up a page where you will be able to set the rebilling amount. Lets turn one of the toggle on.

Here you can set the Rebill amount by moving the pointer from left to right. In this example, we have set the amount to 2.5X.  This means, your customer will be charged $2.5 for the cost of $1.

Along with usage-based pricing for each AI product (with the exception of AI Agents (Voice), AI employee also offers an **Unlimited monthly plan** for each sub-account to use all the above AI products for $97 per month per sub-account.

In the next few steps you will learn how you can set your pricing model to offer unlimited monthly plan for your customers.

If you are in the Agency View then you can just look for **"Reselling"** tab located at the navigation sidebar on the left side. If you are in one of the sub-accounts, you will first need to **"Switch to Agency View"** to be able to find the "Reselling" tab.
