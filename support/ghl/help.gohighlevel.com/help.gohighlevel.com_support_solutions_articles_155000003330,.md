We’re excited to introduce a new feature for agency admins: the ability to hide default templates added by the GHL team! This enhancement allows you to customize the template library, ensuring a cleaner, more tailored experience for your sub-accounts. Now, you can focus on the templates that best suit your needs and provide a smoother, more organized workflow for your clients.

**Benefits**:

1. Time-Saving:
    Hide multiple templates at once, reducing manual effort.
2. Improved Organization:
    Keep the Template Library clean and focused by hiding unused categories.
3. Enhanced Control:
Admins can easily manage and review hidden templates.

How to Use It?

1. Navigate to the Template Library.
2. Click on Settings.
