This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to navigate and utilize the upgraded **Media Storage** feature across HighLevel. From uploading and organizing files to enhanced previews and security-aware integrations, every update is designed to make your workflow smoother and more intuitive.

* * *

## **Accessing Media Storage**

To access Media Storage, navigate to the **left sidebar** of your dashboard and click the **“Media Storage”** icon.

* * *

## **Uploading Files**

Upload files effortlessly via **drag-and-drop**. Just drag media from your computer into the Media Storage interface no buttons required. The improved functionality ensures a faster, more intuitive upload experience.

You can also upload **font files** (such as `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) up to **100MB** in size. These can be used to customize branding in websites or funnels using Custom CSS.

* * *

## **Sorting Media**

Easily organize your media library using powerful sorting options:

- **Sort by Name**: A to Z / Z to A

- **Sort by Size**: Smallest First / Largest First

- **Sort by Modified Date**: Newest First / Oldest First


* * *

## **Grid and List View Enhancements**

You can toggle between **Grid View** and **List View** based on your preference but now, both views offer **enhanced metadata visibility**:

- **Orientation Badge (Grid View)**: Each image now displays a badge showing **Landscape**, **Portrait**, or **Square** format.

- **Pixel Dimensions (List View)**: Width × Height values are shown next to each image name, so you can quickly assess suitability for your design.


> _**Note: Older uploaded images may not immediately display dimensions due to background processing delays**._

* * *

## **Quick Actions via Right-Click and Hover Menus**

Access file options faster using the **right-click dropdown menu** or hover-over quick action buttons. Available actions include:

- Rename

- Delete

- Move to Folder

- Preview

- Insert


This removes the need to rely solely on the top navigation bar.

* * *

## **New Insert & Preview Features**

In Media Storage used within products (e.g., website/funnel builder), you'll now see:

- **“Insert Media” button for single file selection** – instantly insert without navigating away.

- **Preview Option** \- accessible from the three-dot menu for quick viewing.

- **Insert directly from Preview Screen** \- eliminates the back-and-forth between views.


* * *

## **Folder Management Upgrades**

You can now **move entire folders** with their contents (including nested files and subfolders). Here's how:

1. Click the three-dot (⋮) menu next to any folder.

2. Select **"Move to Folder."**

3. Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

4. Confirm the move—everything is relocated together.


> **No duplicates needed.**
>
> **Keeps subfolders intact.**
>
> **Enables a structured, clutter-free layout.**

* * *

## **Trash Functionality for Safer Deletions**

Deleted media files are now moved to **Trash**, where they remain for **30 days** before permanent removal.

### How to Restore or Delete:

- Click the three-dot menu on the top right.

- Select **"Trash."**

- Choose a file to **Restore** or **Delete Permanently.**


> **⚠️ Files are non-recoverable after 30 days.**

* * *

## **Google Drive Integration Enhancements**

- **Connect Drive** now enables importing from Google Drive (owned files only).


> **⚠️ Important Note -** We’re unable to display shared files or shortcuts to shared files, as these are restricted by access and permission settings. At the moment, we can only show files that are owned by you. This limitation is due to how Google Drive handles visibility and ownership.
>
> **⚠️** **Workaround** **-** We recommend creating a copy of the shared file instead of a shortcut this will ensure it appears and functions as expected.

> **Privacy Note: When using the "Login As" feature (e.g., for admin access):**

- The **Connect Drive button** is disabled and grayed out.

- Google Drive data of the original user will not display ensuring strict privacy protection.

## **Seamless Integration Across Products**

Media Storage is now **deeply integrated** with other modules. Whether you’re editing a funnel or designing a website, media opens via a **modal window** not full screen for a more pleasant, non-intrusive user experience.
