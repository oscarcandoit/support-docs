## **What is Google Contacts Integration in Workflows?**

Google Contacts Integration in Workflows enables two-way automation between HighLevel and Google Contacts. With a few clicks, you can trigger HighLevel workflows from changes inside Google Contacts—or push contact updates from HighLevel straight into your Google address book. This keeps customer data consistent everywhere you work.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Google Contacts Integration**

- Stop double-entry—contacts stay in sync automatically.

- Maintain a clean database and avoid duplicates.

- Trigger personalised follow-ups the moment a new Google contact or group is created.

- Eliminate third-party zaps and webhooks, cutting costs and complexity.

- Polling every 5 minutes ensures near-real-time accuracy.

* * *

## **Google Contacts Triggers**

Google Contacts Triggers let events in Google start a HighLevel workflow.

- **New Contact**– Fires when a brand-new contact appears in Google Contacts.

- **New Group** – Fires when someone creates a new contact group in Google Contacts.

Ideal when your team mainly lives in Gmail/Google Workspace but still wants HighLevel automation.

* * *

## **Google Contacts Actions**

Google Contacts Actions execute inside Google whenever a HighLevel workflow reaches the step.

- **Create Contact**– Add a brand-new entry to Google Contacts.

- **Update Contact** – Keep phone, email, or other fields up-to-date.

- **Find Contact**– Search by name, email, or phone.

- **Find or Create Contact**– Safely avoid duplicates by updating when found or adding when missing.

- **Create Group**– Build a new Google contact group on the fly.

- **Add Contact to Groups**– Drop an existing contact into one or multiple groups.

* * *

## **Getting Started with Google Contacts**

**1\. Search in Workflows:** In the workflow builder, search for Google Contacts triggers or actions (e.g., “Find Contact,” “Create Contact”).

**2\. Connect Your Account:** If Google Contacts is already connected, you’ll be able to configure fields right away. If not, click Connect Now and log in with your Google account.

**3\. Alternative Method:** Go to Settings → Integrations. Locate Google Contacts and authorize access.

Once connected, you’ll be able to sync, find, and update contacts seamlessly in your workflows.

## **How Do Google Contacts Triggers Work?**

Google Contacts triggers are powered by polling. HighLevel sends a request to Google at regular intervals (usually every 15 minutes) to check for any new contacts or group additions. Based on the response, workflows are triggered accordingly.

**Setup Steps:** Choose a trigger (e.g., New Contact or New Group). Provide a name for the trigger and click Test Trigger. Testing is required to pull metadata that can be used in subsequent actions through custom values.

## **Save Contacts from Appointments Use Case**

**Use Case:** Automatically add clients to Google Contacts when they book an appointment and organize them into relevant groups (e.g., "Consults", "Demos").

**Workflow Configuration:**

- **Trigger:** Appointment Booked

- **Filter:** Calendar = "Demo Calls"

- **Actions:**

  - Find or Create Contact (Google Contacts)

  - Add Contact to Groups → e.g., "Demo Leads"

**Example:** When a demo is booked via the “Demo Calls” calendar → HighLevel checks if the contact exists → If not found, creates it → Adds the contact to the "Demo Leads" group in Google Contacts.

## **Turn Form Submissions into Google Contacts Use Case**

**Use Case:** Capture lead data from form submissions and sync it into Google Contacts for smooth follow-ups.

**Workflow Configuration:**

- **Trigger:** Form Submitted

- **Filter:** Form Name = "Website Lead Form"

- **Actions:**

  - Find or Create Contact

  - Update Contact (for resubmissions with new info)

**Example:** A user submits the “Website Lead Form” → HighLevel checks Google Contacts by email → Updates if found; creates a new one if not.

## **Create Google Contacts from Notion Records Use Case**

**Use Case:** Automatically create Google Contacts from new records in Notion.

**Workflow Configuration:**

- **Trigger:** Notion - New Database item

- **Database:** "New users data"

- **Actions:**

  - Find a record in database

  - Create Contact

  - Add Contact to Groups

**Example:** A new contact is created in Google Contacts whenever a new record is added to a Notion database. When a new record is added, the workflow checks if the record includes the comment "New user". If the comment is present, a new contact is automatically created in Google Contacts.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I update contacts already in Google Contacts?**

**Q: Do I need a paid Google account for this to work?**

**Q: Can I group contacts dynamically based on tags or pipeline stages?**
