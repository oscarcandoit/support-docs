# **How to Verify Your Business on Meta**

**Meta Verified for Business** is a **paid subscription** that helps businesses get better visibility, support, and protection on Meta platforms (like Facebook and Instagram).

**Do You Need Business Verification?**

Not every business needs to be verified.

You only need to verify your business if:

    •    You’re trying to use certain Meta tools (e.g., APIs, developer features)

    •    You received a notification or email asking you to verify

**Before You Start**

    •    Make sure your **business portfolio** (previously called Business Manager) is eligible for verification.

    •    You must have **full control** of the business portfolio.

    •    **Don’t submit false info**—Meta can deny verification or take action on your account if they find misleading details.

**Steps to Verify Your Business**

    1\.    **Go to the Security Centre** in your Meta Business portfolio.

    2\.    Click **“Start verification.”** _(You might also see this in Meta Ads Manager, Commerce Manager, or App Developer Dashboard)_

    3\.    **Enter your business details:**

    •    Legal business name

    •    Address

    •    Phone number

    •    Website _(must be live and HTTPS-secure)_

    4\.    **Confirm the details:**

    •    If Meta can match them to public records, select your business from the list.

    •    If not, upload documents like a **business license** or **articles of incorporation.**

    5\.    **Verify your connection to the business:** Choose one of the following methods:

    •    **Email** (must match your domain)

    •    **Phone call / Text / WhatsApp message**

    •    **Domain verification** (you’ll need access to your website’s hosting or DNS settings)

    6\.    Click **Done** once finished.

**What Happens Next?**

    •    Verification decisions can take **10 minutes to 14 working days**.

    •    You’ll be notified once it’s complete.

    •    If approved—you’re all set!

    •    If you change any business details later, you’ll need to verify again.

# **FAQs**

**Q: What if none of the listed business records match mine?**

A: Choose _“My business isn’t listed”_ or _“None of these match.”_

**Q: Didn’t receive a confirmation code by phone?**

A: Request another one, or follow [Meta’s troubleshooting guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/help).

**Q: Do I need documents if I use monthly ad invoicing?**

A: No. Just submit your credit line info during verification. Make sure the credit line is linked to your business—not shar
