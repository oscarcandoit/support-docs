# **What is Resend Campaign Visibility & Control?**

This feature improves how you manage resending emails to contacts who didn’t open the original email. You can now pre-configure resend settings during campaign creation and monitor or update them right from the campaign list.

## **Key Benefits of Resend Campaign Visibility & Control**

Easily boost your email campaign performance while saving time with flexible and proactive resend options.

- Pre-plan resend strategies during campaign creation.

- Increase email open rates with automated follow-ups.

- Easily spot rescheduled campaigns using the “Waiting” label.

- Quickly modify resend timing or cancel if needed.

- Works with batch emails and RSS campaigns.

- Reduces manual follow-up effort for marketing teams.


## **How to Set Up and Use Resend Campaigns**

Quickly activate and manage resends during campaign creation to re-engage contacts who missed your message the first time.

**Steps:**

1. **Create or Open a Campaign** – Go to your Email Campaigns dashboard and choose to create a new campaign.

2. **Click “Send” or “Schedule”** – Set up the message as you normally would.

3. **Enable Resend Settings** – Toggle the option and choose:

   - Duration before resend (e.g., 2 days).

   - New subject line for the resend.
4. **Send the Campaign** – The resend is now automatically scheduled.

5. **Track Status** – The resend appears as **“Waiting”** in the campaign list.

## **Resend Support for Batch & RSS Campaigns**

You can now use resend features with both batch and RSS-based email campaigns.

This extends the reach of your recurring or scheduled content by ensuring missed emails get a second chance to engage your audience.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I change the subject line for the resend?**

Yes! You can set a custom subject line during resend configuration.

**Q: Where do I see if a resend is pending?**

Campaigns with a scheduled resend will display “Waiting” in the status column.

**Q: What happens if I cancel the original email?**

If the original email is canceled, the resend will also not be sent.

**Q: Can I resend to people who clicked but didn’t convert?**

This feature only targets unopened emails. For click-based follow-ups, use automation workflows.

### **Next Steps**

- Explore analytics to evaluate resend performance.

- Integrate resend strategies into your standard campaign planning.

- Test subject line variations for resends to improve open rates.
