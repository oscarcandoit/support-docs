# Booked, Polished, and Google-Approved: Google Business Profile Setup to Attract More Clients

Modified on: Mon, 5 May, 2025 at 5:47 AM

**Did you know?**

- **97%** of people learn about a local business online first — before they ever walk in. (Source)

- **76%** of people who search for a nearby service visit a business within 24 hours — if they find it credible. (Source)

- Salons with a fully completed Google Business Profile get **7x more clicks** and **70% more direct appointment requests**.


If your Beauty Salon isn't fully optimized on Google, you're leaving money and loyal clients on the table.

**Benefits:**

- More Walk-Ins

- More Bookings

- More Reviews and Reputation

- More Revenue


Your salon chair should be booked out — not sitting empty because you’re invisible online.

## **Step-by-Step: Build the Perfect Beauty Salon Google Business Profile**

### **1\. Claim or Create Your Profile**

- Go to [Google Business Profile Manager](https://business.google.com/).

- Login with a professional email (ideally one tied to your website domain).

- Search your salon name.

  - Found it? Claim it immediately.

  - Not listed? Create a new one.

**Pro Tip:** Use your official branding consistently across all platforms.

- Claim or create a Google Business Profile


### **2\. Choose the Right Categories — Strategically**

**Primary Category (choose ONE that’s your main identity):**

- Beauty Salon

- Hair Salon

- Nail Salon

- Makeup Artist

- Facial Spa


**Secondary Categories (support your services):**

- Hairdresser

- Skincare Clinic

- Waxing Hair Removal

- Bridal Shop


**Tip:** Adding too many irrelevant categories can confuse Google and hurt your visibility.

Understand how local search works

Improve your local ranking on Google

### **3\. Nail the Salon Information**

- Name (Exactly like your branding)

- Address (Accurate, Google Maps friendly)

- Business Phone (separate from personal number)

- Website URL (preferably with online booking link)


**Important:** Your Name, Address, Phone (NAP) must match your website, Facebook, Instagram bios, Yelp, and everywhere else.

Edit your business description

### **4\. Write a Dreamy, Beauty-First Salon Description**

**Formula for your salon description:**

- Highlight Signature Services (Hair Color, Bridal Makeup, Luxury Facials)

- Showcase Unique Selling Points (award-winning stylists, organic products, celebrity clients)

- Add a local keyword (example: "Located in Downtown Austin.")


**Example:** "Glow Beauty Lounge brings luxury beauty services to life. From bespoke hair color transformations to flawless bridal looks, our award-winning team in Austin is dedicated to helping you shine inside and out. Experience the artistry of beauty at Glow."

**Interactive Tip:** Write down your salon’s top 3 strengths. Use them in your description.

### **5\. Add Irresistible Visuals**

**According to Google:**

- Listings with photos see **42% more direction requests**.

- They also get **35% more website clicks**.


**Photo Checklist:**

- Exterior: Shopfront (beautiful, inviting entrance)

- Interior: Chairs, mirrors, vibe shots

- Staff in Action: Styling, makeup, facials (with permission)

- Product Display: Premium beauty brands

- Client Transformations: Before and after (with signed client consent)


**Tip:** Bright, clean, smiling photos outperform dark or cluttered shots.

Add photos to your Business Profile

Business Profile photo guidelines

### **6\. Add Detailed Services and Pricing**

Spell out exactly what you offer:

- Women's Haircut and Blowdry – from $45

- Keratin Smoothing Treatment – from $150

- Full Bridal Makeup – from $250


**Stat:** Salons that list services get **28% more direct booking actions**.

### **7\. Turn On Messaging**

- Enable "Chat with customers" in your GBP dashboard.

- Set an auto-reply like: "Thank you for reaching out to \[Salon Name\]! We’ll get back to you within 1 hour."


**Tip:** Respond fast — Google rewards responsiveness with better ranking.

### **8\. Collect Rave Reviews — and Keep Responding**

**The Beauty Industry is reputation-first.**

**Ask every happy client to leave a review:**

- Provide a QR code at checkout

- Send a direct link via text after appointments


**When replying to reviews:**

- Mention the service

- Stay warm, professional, and personal

## **Final Takeaway**

Your Google Business Profile is your digital beauty billboard.

When someone types "best hair colorist near me" or "bridal makeup trial near me," you should be the first name they see — glowing with credibility, beauty, and style.

Set it up. Polish it monthly. Watch your chairs fill up, week after week.
