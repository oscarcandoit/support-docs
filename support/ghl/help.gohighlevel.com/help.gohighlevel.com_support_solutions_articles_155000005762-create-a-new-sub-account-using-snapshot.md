# **Overview of Creating a Sub-Account Using a Snapshot**

Creating a sub-account using a snapshot allows agencies to easily create a new account that includes all the tools, workflows, settings, and assets packaged in the selected snapshot. Once the sub-account is created, the snapshot is automatically loaded into it, eliminating the need for manual loading of a snap-shot after creation. This streamlines the onboarding process and ensures the new account starts with a consistent, prebuilt setup.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Creating a Sub-Account Using a Snapshot**

Using snapshots to create sub-accounts helps agencies set up standardized sub-accounts faster.

- **Faster onboarding:** Pre-loads all essential assets and settings, reducing manual setup.

- **Consistency Across Accounts:** Ensures desired accounts include the same assets and settings.

- **Time savings:** Eliminates repetitive configuration for each new sub-account after creation.

- **Error reduction:** Reduces the risk of setup mistakes or missing assets.


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

Understanding the setup requirements helps ensure the process is successful the first time.

- Must have **Agency Admin** access

- Snapshot must already exist in your account

- Snapshot should include the key assets you want duplicated (funnels, triggers, calendars, etc.)

- Optionally, import or create the snapshot beforehand:

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I delete a snapshot from an account after it's created?**

No, once applied, a snapshot cannot be “unloaded" or "deleted". You can delete or modify specific elements manually.

**Q: What access is needed to create sub-accounts using snapshots?**

Only users with Agency Admin permissions can perform this action.

**Q: What assets are included in snapshots?**

Funnels, forms, workflows, calendars, settings, and more depending on what was saved in the snapshot. For more information, read [Snapshot Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982511).

**Q: Will the snapshot overwrite anything in the new sub-account?**

No. Since the sub-account is being created fresh, there is nothing to overwrite. The snapshot is applied during account creation, so its contents become the initial setup.

**Q: Can I apply more than one snapshot to a new sub-account?**

Not during the creation process. Only one snapshot can be selected when creating a sub-account. However, you can manually apply additional snapshots after the sub-account has been created.

**Q: What happens to funnels and websites after loading from a snapshot?**

When you load a snapshot into a sub-account, all included funnels and websites are copied over as drafts. They won’t be live until you connect a **custom domain and publish them.**
