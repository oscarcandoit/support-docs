**6\. Customize Email Body:** Customize the email body as needed and click 'Save.'

**7\. Publish Workflow:** Once your workflow is set up, publish it. Now, each time a contact enters the workflow triggered by your defined condition, a unique one-time link will be generated and sent to them via email.

**Trigger**

**Form Submitted**\- Add the trigger and select the form on submitting which the user should get a booking link.

**Action**
