# **What is Export Contacts as CSV Upgrade?**

The Contacts Export Upgrade replaces the old, browser-based export with a scalable backend service. Instead of waiting for a CSV to download in the foreground, your export job is queued on HighLevel’s servers, processed in parallel, and tracked in real time from the Bulk Actions dashboard. Once complete, a ready-to-download file appears in Bulk Actions and remains available for 30 days.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Contacts Export Upgrade**

- **Work Uninterrupted:** Exports run asynchronously—no UI blocking.

- **Scales to Big Data:** Far fewer failures on multi-million-row datasets.

- **Real-time Visibility:** Track progress on the Bulk Actions page.

- **Hands-free Alerts:** Get notified when files are ready—no manual checks.

- **Built-in Retention:** 30-day cloud storage protects against accidental loss.

- **Controlled Access:** Admin-only downloads support security and compliance.

* * *

## **Why Export Contacts**

The **Export Contacts** feature lets users download their HighLevel contacts into a CSV file. The exported file contains important details such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, tags, and custom fields (if selected). Some more reasons/use cases are as follows:

- **CRM Migration** – Moving contacts to a different CRM platform.

- **Marketing & Outreach** – Creating lists for email or SMS campaigns.

- **Data Backup & Security** – Storing an offline copy of your contacts.

- **Team Collaboration** – Sharing lists with colleagues or business partners.

- **Analytics & Reporting** – Using data to generate insights.

* * *

## **Prerequisites and Limitations**

- The file will be in **CSV format** and can be opened in **Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet software**.

- Some data, such as **notes exceeding 255 characters**, may be truncated.

- Exports do **not include automation history** (e.g., past emails, and SMS logs).

- **Only Admin Users Can Export Contacts.** If you do not see the export option, check your user role permissions or contact an admin.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I export only specific data fields for each contact in the exported .csv file?**

You can customize the columns in the exported .csv file by selecting or deselecting specific data fields before initiating the export. This way, you can focus on the most relevant information.

**Q: What happens if a contact's latest note exceeds 255 characters?**

Only the latest note of up to 255 characters is included when exporting contacts. If a contact's latest note is longer than this limit, it will be truncated to fit within the 255-character constraint.

**Q: Can I export contacts from multiple accounts or locations simultaneously?**

You must export contacts separately for each sub-account or location. However, you can combine the resulting .csv files in a spreadsheet application to consolidate contact data from multiple sources.

**Q: Is it possible to schedule automatic exports of contact data?**

This feature is not available at this time.

**Q: Who can download exported files?**

Only **Agency Admins** and **Location Admins** can download completed exports from Bulk Actions.

**Q: How long are exported files available?**

Export files are available for 30 days. After that, the download option is disabled.

**Q: How do I import the exported .csv file into another contact management platform?**

Most contact management platforms provide an import feature that supports .csv files. You will need to follow the specific import instructions for the target platform, which typically involves mapping the columns in the .csv file to the appropriate fields in the new system.
