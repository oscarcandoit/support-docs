What’s New?

- Split Column Functionality is now available in Documents and Contracts.
- Users can drag and drop elements side by side to automatically create columns, allowing for better organization and layout.
- This feature improves the presentation of information, making it easier to create clear and professional documents.

How to Use It:

- Drag an element (such as text, an image, or a table) next to another element in the document editor to create a split column layout.

Why We Built It:

- We developed this feature to offer users greater flexibility in document design.
- It addresses the need for enhanced formatting options, helping users create clearer, more organized proposals and contracts.
