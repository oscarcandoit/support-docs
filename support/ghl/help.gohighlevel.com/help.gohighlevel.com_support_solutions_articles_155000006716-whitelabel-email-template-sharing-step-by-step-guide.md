# Whitelabel Email Template Sharing: Step-by-Step Guide

Modified on: Thu, 16 Oct, 2025 at 6:07 AM

You can create template share links that let sub-account users import a template directly into their own account. With a quick adjustment, these links can also be formatted to use your own white-labeled domain, keeping everything fully branded to your agency.

  - [3\. Insert the Share ID Into the Template](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006716-whitelabel-email-template-sharing-step-by-step-guide#3.-Insert-the-Share-ID-Into-the-Template)
  - [4\. Share the Custom Link](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006716-whitelabel-email-template-sharing-step-by-step-guide#4.-Share-the-Custom-Link)

### **Steps to Create a Template Share Link**

#### **1\. Generate a Template Share Link**

- Go to **Marketing > Emails > Templates**.
- Click the three dots next to the template you want to share.
- Select **Share**.
- Copy the generated share link. It will look like this:

```
https://affiliates.gohighlevel.com/?fp_ref=xxxx&email_template_share=6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```

#### **2\. Grab the Share ID**

Paste the link and find the part after `template_share=`.

**_Note_**: _Share wont work for the account/ location user role. It is accessible only by agency owner/admin, agency user and account admin._

**Example:**

```
email_template_share=6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```

The **Share ID** here is:

```
6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```

#### **3\. Insert the Share ID Into the Template**

Use this template to build your custom share link:

```
https://app.YOURDOMAIN.com/emails/share/SHAREID
```

Replace `YOURDOMAIN.com` with your white-labeled domain.

Replace `SHAREID` with the Share ID you copied.

**Example:**

```
https://app.whitelabel.com/emails/share/6438b5b145411d0ce4332f1b
```

#### **4\. Share the Custom Link**

Now you can share this link with sub-account users, allowing them to import the template directly into their accounts under your branded domain.
