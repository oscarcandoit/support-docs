## **What is Rich Text for Notes & Task Descriptions?**

Rich Text adds lightweight, everyday formatting to notes and task descriptions so teams can emphasize key details, structure follow‑ups with lists, and link out to supporting assets—all without leaving HighLevel.

Rich Text for Notes & Task Descriptions provides formatting controls (bold, italics, underline, strikethrough), bulleted and numbered lists, hyperlinks, undo/redo, and basic paste formatting preservation. Formatting renders consistently wherever those notes and tasks appear in HighLevel.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Rich Text for Notes & Task Descriptions**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide when to use Rich Text and how to standardize note-taking across your team.

- **Clarity:** Highlights key points so teammates can scan information quickly.

- **Consistency:** Looks the same across Contacts, Opportunities, Companies, Conversations, and Calendars.

- **Speed:** Apply emphasis, lists, and links directly—no need to switch tools or paste raw URLs.

- **Traceability:** Undo/redo reduces mistakes during longer edits.

- **Collaboration:** Shared note patterns and linked context improve handoffs between teams.

- **Reduced clean‑up:** Pasting preserves basic formatting from docs and email, minimizing rework.


* * *

## **Formatting Toolbar**

The toolbar provides quick access to the most-used formatting controls for efficient note-taking.

- Bold, italics, underline, strikethrough

- Bulleted and numbered lists

- Hyperlinks (insert/edit)

- Undo / Redo

* * *

## **Lists & Structure**

Lists make action items and meeting notes easier to read and maintain over time.

- Use **bulleted lists** for ideas, talking points, and general notes.

- Use **numbered lists** for steps, follow-ups, or ordered tasks.


* * *

## **Hyperlinks**

Add links to external assets (docs, drive folders, tickets) so teams can jump directly to details from within your CRM.

To insert or edit a link in a note or task description:

1. Select the text you want to hyperlink.

2. Click the **Link** icon in the toolbar.

3. Paste the URL and confirm.

4. Save your note/task. The link will render as clickable text wherever the note or task appears.

* * *

## **Rendering Across the CRM**

Notes and task descriptions appear in multiple places; Rich Text ensures the same content stays readable wherever it’s shown.

Rich Text formatting renders consistently in these areas:

- Contacts

- Opportunities

- Companies

- Conversations

- Calendars


* * *

## **Limitations & Expectations**

Setting clear expectations prevents confusion and helps your team adopt Rich Text confidently.

- The current release focuses on **lightweight formatting**. Not supported: images, tables, headings, text colors, text alignment, code blocks, and checkbox-style task lists.

- Pasting preserves **basic** formatting only (emphasis, lists, links). Complex layout and media are omitted.

- Public API: **No changes introduced** by this feature.


* * *

## **How To Use Rich Text for Notes & Task Descriptions**

Rich Text for Notes & Task Descriptions is now generally available across HighLevel, giving your team access to the editor and ensuring consistent formatting wherever notes and tasks appear.

1. Open any **note** or **task** (new or existing).

For example, we'll use a note or task from **Contacts → Open Existing/New Contact** in a sub-account.

2. Click in the **Note** **Description** field.

3. Use the **toolbar** to apply formatting, insert links, or create lists.

4. **Save** to apply changes.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does Rich Text change how notes or tasks are stored or exported?**

Rich Text focuses on on-screen readability. When exporting or printing, content may be simplified—review exports to confirm the appearance you need.

**Q: Can I add images, tables, or headings to Tasks/Notes?**

No. Notes and task descriptions support a **lightweight** set: emphasis, lists, links, undo/redo, and basic paste formatting.

**Q: Are hyperlink clicks tracked?**

Hyperlinks are provided for quick navigation. This feature does not introduce link tracking.

**Q: Will formatting appear on mobile?**

Formatting is designed to be readable across the platform. If you don’t see a toolbar on mobile, use the desktop/web app to edit while viewing remains intact.

**Q: Is there an API change?**

No. The release does not add or modify public API endpoints.

**Q: Do internal comments in Conversations use the same editor as Notes?**

Internal comments are distinct from Notes. Rich Text for Notes & Task Descriptions improves note/task editing; internal comments may have different capabilities.

**Q: Are text colors or alignment available?**

No. The feature focuses on essential formatting for clarity and consistency.
