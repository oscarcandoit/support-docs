### **How to configure**

- **Action Name**: Enter a name for the action. By default, it's set to "GMB".
- **Message**: Write your message in the text box. You can use:
  - **Custom Values**: Click on the `{}` icon to insert custom values such as contact details, appointment information, or other dynamic data points.
  - **Trigger Links**: Use the link icon to add predefined links, which can be selected from the list. These links will be clickable in the GMB message.

## Example

To use the GMB action effectively, consider the following workflow configuration:

1. **Trigger**: Choose a relevant trigger such as "Appointment Reminder".
2. **Action**: Set the GMB action with a message like:
   - **Message**: "Hello {{contact.name}}, this is a reminder for your upcoming appointment on {{appointment.date}}. If you have any questions, please let us know!"
   - Use the `{}` icon to insert custom values like contact name and appointment date.

By setting up the action this way, you ensure that each contact receives a personalized reminder through Google My Business, making your interactions more meaningful and engaging.
