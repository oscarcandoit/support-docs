# What is the Troubleshoot CTA in Facebook Integration?

The Troubleshoot CTA is a new guided tool that helps you quickly identify and fix common Facebook integration issues, such as missing permissions and unmapped forms. It also includes an improved Sync Leads feature to process any unprocessed leads in just a few clicks — without relying on manual troubleshooting steps.

## Key Benefits of the Troubleshoot CTA

The new enhancements help you confidently manage your Facebook integration without relying on support. Here’s why it matters:

- Simplifies self-troubleshooting of permissions and form mapping issues.

- Reduces missed leads by ensuring forms are correctly mapped and permissions are up-to-date.

- Encourages proper use of automatic lead syncing rather than manual syncing.

- Cleaner UI for better focus and usability.

## How To Use the Troubleshoot CTA in Facebook Integration

Here’s a step-by-step guide to fixing your Facebook integration issues using the new Troubleshoot CTA:

1. Open the Facebook Integration Card in your account.

2. Notice the updated layout — Settings and Disconnect buttons have been moved into a three-dot menu for a decluttered view.


3. If there are issues:





   - You’ll see a warning icon if your Facebook forms are not mapped.





     - Clicking it redirects you to Facebook Form Field Mapping to fix the issue.
   - You’ll see a different warning icon if there are missing permissions.





     - Clicking it prompts you to Troubleshoot the connection.

4. Click Troubleshoot to enter the guided troubleshooting flow.

5. Inside the Troubleshoot flow:





   - Review any highlighted permission issues or mapping warnings.

   - Use the Sync Leads option to process unprocessed leads if needed.
6. When using Sync Leads:





   - Select the time range from the dropdown (e.g., past 7 days, 30 days).

   - A modal will appear showing a summary of what will be synced for your review.

7. Confirm to start syncing leads for all mapped forms across all Facebook Pages linked to your sub-account.

8. After syncing, confirm that your Facebook leads are now appearing in your CRM as expected.


## Important Notes

- Sync Leads is now under Troubleshoot intentionally to prevent misuse as a manual workflow. It should only be used when leads are not syncing automatically.

- The feature now supports syncing for all pages and forms mapped in the sub-account at once, rather than single-page sync.

- Warning icons help guide you directly to unresolved issues, reducing confusion and support needs.

- Your Facebook integration relies on proper form mapping and permissions, so resolving these warnings is critical for continuous lead syncing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why did Sync Leads move under Troubleshoot?

Many users relied on it as a manual sync step rather than fixing the root problem. Moving it under Troubleshoot reinforces it as a troubleshooting action.

Q: Will my leads sync automatically without using Sync Leads?

Yes! As long as your form mapping and permissions are correct, leads will sync automatically.

Q: Can I still sync leads for a single page only?

No. The new design intentionally syncs all mapped forms across all pages to ensure no leads are missed.

Q: What happens if forms aren’t mapped?

You’ll see a warning icon. Clicking it will take you directly to map your Facebook form fields.

### Next Steps

- Check your Facebook Integration Card for any warnings.

- Use the Troubleshoot CTA to resolve permission and mapping issues.

- Sync unprocessed leads only when automatic syncing fails.

- Stay updated for more UI improvements coming next week to further enhance your experience.
