# My CRM Data is Loading Slowly What Can I Do?

Modified on: Fri, 25 Feb, 2022 at 1:49 AM

#### If you or your customer are facing issue with your dashboard loading slowly or it takes a while for the data to show up on a specific module, please follow the troubleshooting steps below:

## **Step 1:** Login using an **incognito window** and check if it is still happening.

If this does not resolve the issue, it has something to do with the browser cache. Please proceed to the next step below

## **Step 2:** Ask the user to please **clear browser cache** and reload the page. The user will need to sign in again.

To clear cache please paste the URL in your preferred browser.

- Chrome: chrome://settings/siteData
- Edge: edge://settings/clearBrowserData?search=cache

```
If you do not see your browser, please google further instructions on how to clear your cookies/ cache
```

If this does not work please proceed to the next step below

## **Step 3:** If the issue is still happening, this might be because of an **extension(s)** installed on their browser. Ask the user to disable all the extensions and check again.

Proceed to step 2, if this step does not resolve the issue.

## **Step 4:** Try different browsers like Firefox or Safari or Chrome. If it still fails, follow the next step.

## **Step 5:** Go to the page where you see this happening and **right click > Click on Inspect > Console > Take a screenshot of the error message that you see here and raise a ticket.**
