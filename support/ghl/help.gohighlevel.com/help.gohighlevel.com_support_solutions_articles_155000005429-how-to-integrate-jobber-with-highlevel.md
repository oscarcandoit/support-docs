## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I connect more than one sub-account to a single Jobber account?**

No, Jobber only supports one active connection. This means that you can only connect one HighLevel sub-account to a unique Jobber account.

**Q: How long does it take for the initial contacts<>clients sync between HighLevel and Jobber?**

Jobber allows syncing about 2500 records for every 5 minutes. So based on the start date you're selecting in "Sync Data" tab in your Jobber app, the system will take the necessary time to sync all the clients data inside HighLevel.

**Q: How does HighLevel match clients with Contacts?**

HighLevel maintains the Jobber client's unique ID. This allows to maintain the sync even if you update the email or phone number

**Q: Can I pause or stop the 2-way sync?**

No, we currently don't have that option. To stop the sync without disrupting your workflows build in Jobber, you must disconnect the app from Jobber by navigating to Jobber App Marketplace > Connected Apps > LeadConnector App and click the Disconnect button.

**Q: Once I've initiated the sync, can I go back and change the start date for syncing my historic client data?**
