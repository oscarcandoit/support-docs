## **Understanding the Issue**

### Common Problems Faced by Users

1. **Mismatched URLs:** Different URLs appear in different sections of the funnel editor.

2. **Random Numbers in URLs:** GoHighLevel appends numbers to URLs, leading to indexing inconsistencies.

3. **Incorrect Indexing:** The indexed URL in Google Search Console differs from the URL intended for use.


* * *

## **Causes of the Issue**

- **Auto-Generated URLs:** Funnel steps may generate random URLs.

- **Missing Canonical Tags:** Without these tags, search engines may prioritize the wrong URLs.

- **Multiple URL Versions:** Inconsistencies in `https://`, `http://`, and `www.` variations lead to indexing issues.


* * *

## **Step-by-Step Solutions**

### **1\. Removing Random Numbers from Funnel URLs**

GoHighLevel may automatically add numbers to the URL. To prevent this:

1. Open the **Funnel Settings**.

2. Edit the **Page Path** to remove unnecessary numbers.

3. Save changes and republish the page.

### **2\. Setting Canonical Meta Tags**

To ensure search engines prioritize the correct URL:

1. Access **SEO Metadata Settings** in the page editor.
2. Add a canonical tag specifying the preferred URL.
3. Ensure the canonical tag matches the URL submitted to Google Search Console.

### **3\. Submitting the Correct URL to Google Search Console**

1. Log into **Google Search Console**.

2. Use the **URL Inspection Tool** to check the indexed URL.

3. If the wrong URL is indexed, request indexing for the correct one.


### **4\. Ensuring URL Consistency Across the Website**

- Choose either `www.` or non-`www.` and stick to it.

- Use only `https://` for all pages.

- Set up **301 Redirects** to point alternative URLs to the correct version.

- To understand how to set up 301 Redirects you can refer to the [Ultimate Guide to 301 Redirects](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001202713-ultimate-guide-to-301-redirects).
