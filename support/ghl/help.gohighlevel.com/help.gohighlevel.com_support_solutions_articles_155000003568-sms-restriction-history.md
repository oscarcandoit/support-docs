## **What is SMS Restriction History?**

The **SMS Restriction History** dashboard provides businesses with a transparent way to track and manage their SMS sending activities. Logging warnings and restrictions helps users stay compliant with carrier guidelines and avoid disruptions in communication. A read‑only log showing warnings and temporary sending restrictions triggered by carrier‑ or policy‑driven thresholds. Typical causes include:

- Daily/Weekly sending limit violations

- High opt‑out rate

- High delivery error rate (including carrier filtering such as Error 30007)

**Example:**

If a campaign generates a **6% opt‑out rate—above the 2–3% target** you should stay under—the sub‑account may receive a temporary restriction. The log captures the date, time, and additional details so you can investigate and avoid repeats.

* * *

## **Where to find the SMS Restriction Log**

Navigate to **Location → Settings → Phone Numbers → Advanced Settings** (top‑right). In the **far‑right tab**, click **Restriction History** to view events for the sub‑account.

```
Note — Filtering Options

On the right-hand side of the table, there are Start Date and End Date filters, allowing users to view restriction history for a specific time period.

The pagination control at the bottom ensures that users can navigate through multiple pages of restriction records.
```

* * *

## **Using the Restriction Log**

The table lists each restriction event with:

- **Date** — when the warning or restriction occurred

- **Restriction Type** — Warning or Temporary Restriction

- **Restriction Reason** — e.g., Opt‑out rate exceeded threshold

- **Percentage / Count** — the measured value at the time (e.g., opt‑out %)

- **Additional Details** — related metrics such as Error Rate

* * *

## **Threshold guidance**

- **Opt‑out rate:** Target: stay below 2–3% to avoid risk. Good: 0–1%. At 3%, the sub‑account is locked for 24 hours.

- **Delivery error rate:** Good: 0–6%. At 10%, the sub‑account is locked for 24 hours.

```
IMPORTANT: After a lockout, review recent sends, content, list hygiene, and compliance settings before resuming.
```

* * *

## **What are the error and opt-out rates good for having a threshold?**

1. A **High Opt-Out** **rate** indicates that contacts receiving your messages have objected, generated complaints, or marked your SMS as spam. A good opt-out rate is typically in the range of 0—1%. Once the opt-out rate hits **3%**, the sub-account will be locked for sending text messages for 24 hours.

2. A **High Delivery Error Rate** indicates that you are sending SMS to contacts that are no longer in service, are unreachable, or use a non-SMS-capable device, such as a landline. This may also mean that external carrier filters are refusing to deliver your SMS due to bad sending behavior in the past. A good error rate is typically in the range of 0—6%. Once the error rate hits 10%, the sub-account will be locked for sending text messages for 24 hours.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Does Restriction History show real‑time data?**

It records **events with timestamps**; use date filters to explore windows of time.

**Q. Will I see both warnings and temporary restrictions?**

Yes—the log includes **warnings** and **temporary restrictions** along with the reason and measured values.

**Q. How do I lower my error rate?**

Clean lists regularly, remove landlines, verify numbers during capture, and avoid content patterns that trigger filtering.
