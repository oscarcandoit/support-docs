# How it works?

## Initiate LinkedIn Integration:

- Go to the integrations page located under the settings tab.
- Find the LinkedIn integration.
- Click on Connect to initiate the process.

- On clicking connect, User would be asked to login to linkedin. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050937133/original/J-4GqzyNUDDGAYB-7vYtTDI3n3uL2nNdqw.png?1754385932)
- Ensure you grant all necessary permissions for the integration to be successful.
- On successful login, Choose an ad account or multiple ad accounts to connect to your sub-account.
- Note: There's no limit to the number of ad accounts you can connect to your sub-account. Ensure the ad account you're integrating has a linked LinkedIn page. Without this, the integration won't be successful.

- For each ad account you're integrating, determine its sync time. Options include:
  - All leads: Sync all leads from the past 90 days and all new leads.
  - New leads: Only sync new leads.
- Click on Connect to proceed.

## Form Field Mapping:

- Click on Configure form field mapping or go to the LinkedIn form field mapping tab at the top.
- Use the Map Fields button to align your LinkedIn form fields with CRM fields.
- Click Confirm to save and complete the integration.
- If you want to disable inbound leads from any of the forms, toggle the status off.
