## **What are Saved Section Templates?**

Saved Section Templates are a powerful enhancement in HighLevel that allow users to create, save, and reuse content sections across multiple assets, such as Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and E-Commerce Stores. With this update, you can choose between three types of saved sections: Universal (syncs everywhere), Global (syncs within a single asset), and Template (static, reusable, and non-syncing).

- **Section Templates:** Saves as a copy, which can be used anywhere as a template.

- **Global Sections:** Saves at the funnel level. Any changes in one instance will sync across this funnel only.

- **Universal Sections:** Saves at the account level. Any changes in one instance will sync across all instances, account-wide.

This system ensures design consistency, saves time, and reduces confusion about how content updates propagate.

```
Difference between Universal and Global Sections:

Universal Sections update automatically across every instance in the account across Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and E-Commerce Store.

Global Sections update only within the current funnel/website.
```

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Saved Section Templates**

Saved Section Templates offer several advantages that help users manage content more efficiently and maintain brand consistency:

- **Centralized Updates:** Universal Sections automatically sync changes across all instances in Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and E-Commerce Stores.

- **Flexible Reuse:** Choose between Universal, Global, or Template sections based on your needs for syncing or static content.

- **Visual Selection:** Automated screenshots and clear labels make it easy to preview and select saved sections.

- **Efficient Cloning:** Cloned sections and snapshots get unique IDs, so edits to copies won’t affect originals.

- **Improved Performance:** Enhanced backend architecture ensures faster syncing, better reliability, and secure template management.

- **Reduced Confusion:** Clear section types and visual cues help users understand how edits will impact their content.

- **No Personal Data Stored:** Only layout information is saved, protecting user privacy.

## **How To Set Up Saved Section Templates**

Proper setup of Saved Section Templates ensures your content is reusable and updates as intended. Follow these steps to save and use sections effectively:

### **Step 1:** Open the Page Editor

Navigate to your Funnel, Website, Webinar, or E-Commerce Store in HighLevel and open the page editor.

### **Step 2:** Select a Section

Choose the section you want to save for reuse.

### **Step 3:** Save the Section

Click the “Save Section” option. A unified save modal will appear.

### **Step 4:** Choose Section Type:

- **Universal:** Syncs updates across all assets in your account.

- **Global:** Syncs updates only within the current funnel or website.

- **Template:** Creates a static, reusable section that does not sync when edited elsewhere.

```
Note: Name your section and choose how you would like to save the section, as a Section Template or Global Section or a Universal Section. Once saved once a section is saved as Universal, Global, or Template, its type cannot be changed.
```

### **Step 6:** Finalize Save and Insert Saved Section

When editing another page, use the “Add Section” option to browse and insert your saved Universal, Global, or Template sections.

## **Best Practices for Section Management**

- Plan your section type before saving, as it cannot be changed later.

- Use Universal Sections for content that must stay consistent everywhere (e.g., headers, footers).

- Use Global Sections for content unique to a specific funnel or website.

- Use Templates for reusable blocks that may need customization in each instance.

- To change a section’s type, clone it and save the clone under the desired type.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I change the type of a section after saving it?**

No, once a section is saved as Universal, Global, or Template, its type cannot be changed. Clone the section and save the clone under a different type if needed.

**Q: Will edits to a Universal Section update everywhere?**

Yes, any changes made to a Universal Section will automatically sync across all instances in Funnels, Websites, Webinars, Blogs, and E-Commerce Stores.

**Q: What happens if I clone a funnel or section?**

Cloned sections receive a unique ID and do not sync with the original, allowing you to edit them independently.

**Q: Are screenshots available for all saved sections?**

Automated screenshots are generated for Universal and Global section templates, making it easier to browse and select templates.

**Q: What’s the difference between Global and Universal Sections?**

Universal Sections sync across all assets in your account, while Global Sections sync only within the funnel or website where they were created.

**Q: How do I reuse a section in a different funnel or website?**

Save the section as Universal or Template, then insert it into any funnel, website, blog, or store as needed.
