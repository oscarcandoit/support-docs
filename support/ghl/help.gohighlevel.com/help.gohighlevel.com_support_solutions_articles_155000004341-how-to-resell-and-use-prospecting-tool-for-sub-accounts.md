The **Prospecting Tool for Sub-Accounts** empowers agencies to provide their sub-accounts with the ability to search for new business prospects, generate marketing audit reports, and customise prospecting efforts based on niches, location, and other preferences. This tool is particularly useful for agencies that want to:

- **Resell prospecting services** to their clients.
- **Restrict access to the main agency dashboard** while still allowing sub-accounts to leverage powerful prospecting tools.

In this article, we’ll guide you through the key features and how to use the **Prospecting Tool for Sub-Accounts** effectively.

* * *

# **Pre-requisites**

* * *

## Disabling Offers for certain clients

If you have certain clients that you do not wish to offer Prospecting Tool to, you can turn if off from Agency Left Menu -> List of accounts -> Search for location -> View details and toggling off the Offer Prospecting option.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037735606/original/416S8IXl8eH5xza5ZJtQCsdBkkIInszy1A.png?1733314511)

**Please note:**

```
This offer can only be disabled before the sale has happened. Once a location already purchases Prospecting Tool, you can not disable it from here.
```

* * *

## **How do your Clients complete the purchase?**

Once your clients have discovered the feature, they can proceed to purchase Prospecting Tool from you by clicking on the Subscribe Now button.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037735957/original/jV4xA1i9KU9skGjE9q5Jy3VHn7qdeMcy1g.png?1733314748)

When your client clicks the Continue button the system will create the subscription, process the payment, and take them to the Prospecting Tool dashboard.

# **How does the billing work?**

When your client purchases Prospecting Tool it creates 2 subscriptions in the System

1. Between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients
2. Between HighLevel & your card so you can pay $29 / month to HighLevel
