- **Element-Level Label Alignment:** Element-level label alignment lets you set a different label position for each field, instead of applying one global alignment to the entire quiz. Use it to fine‑tune visual rhythm and spacing, especially in compact layouts. To set element-level label alignment, first select a question. In the right sidebar, **use the selector Arrows under Label Alignment** to define your choice. Keep in mind that on mobile, alignment automatically defaults to Top, ensuring a clear, user-friendly layout regardless of desktop settings
