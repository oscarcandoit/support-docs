## What is Closed Captions & Subtitle Support?

Closed Captions & Subtitle Support is a feature within the HighLevel Course Builder that allows you to upload subtitle files to your course videos. These subtitles can be provided in multiple languages, and you can edit them directly within the platform. With both a visual and raw editor available, this feature enables you to enhance accessibility, ensure legal compliance, and cater to a wider audience of learners who benefit from text-based reinforcement.

## Key Benefits of Closed Captions & Subtitle Support

Subtitle support enhances course accessibility and learning by including captions for various languages, improving comprehension for all audiences.

- **Reach a global audience by supporting multiple subtitle languages.**

- **Improve content accessibility for users with hearing impairments.**

- **Increase retention and comprehension through visual reinforcement.**

- **Identify and correct errors with real-time subtitle issue detection.**

- **Edit subtitles manually or visually to ensure clarity and accuracy.**

- **Ensure subtitles are properly synced with your video content.**


## **How to Upload Subtitles in HighLevel**

Upload subtitles to your video lessons using standard .srt files to quickly enable captions across different languages.

**To upload subtitles to your course videos:**

1. **Navigate to Sites > Courses and open the course you want to edit.**

2. **Click on a Lesson that contains a video.**

3. **Locate the Upload Subtitles option next to the video player.**

4. **Click Upload Subtitle and choose a .srt file from your device.**

5. **Select the appropriate language from the dropdown list.**

6. **Click Save to attach the subtitle file to the video.**


## **Using the Advanced Subtitle Editor**

Edit and improve your subtitles with HighLevel’s advanced editor, featuring real-time error detection and visual timestamp navigation.

**After uploading a subtitle file, you can use the built-in editor to refine it:**

- **Click on the Edit Subtitles button next to the uploaded file.**

- **View subtitles in a structured list with timestamps and text content.**

- **Navigate easily by clicking timestamps to jump to specific video moments.**

- **If there are issues (e.g., overlapping lines or gaps), warning icons will appear.**

- **Hover over the warning icon to view the issue description.**

- **Click directly into the text to make corrections, then select Save Changes.**


## **Raw Mode Editing**

**Raw Mode lets you manually adjust subtitles for full control over text and timing when precision is essential.**

**Raw Mode is useful when you want direct access to the subtitle file’s structure:**

- **In the Subtitle Editor, click the Switch to Raw Mode button.**

- **Edit the file using standard .srt formatting (e.g., timestamps followed by subtitle text).**

- **Carefully review the syntax to avoid formatting errors.**

- **Once complete, click Save to update the video with your changes.**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What subtitle formats are supported?**

**Currently, HighLevel supports .srt files only.**

**Q: Can I upload subtitles in more than one language?**

**Yes. You can upload multiple .srt files, each assigned to a different language, allowing viewers to select their preferred option.**

**Q: Will subtitles automatically align with the video?**

**Subtitles will sync based on the timestamps provided in the .srt file. You can adjust timing in the subtitle editor if needed.**

**Q: Is Raw Mode required for subtitle editing?**

**No. Raw Mode is optional and intended for users who prefer manual editing. The visual editor offers a user-friendly alternative.**

**Q: Can learners choose subtitle languages while watching the video?**

**Yes. Viewers can switch between available subtitle languages using the player controls.**

**Q: What happens if my subtitle file contains errors?**

**The system will display warning icons for overlapping lines or missing timestamps. You can fix these in the editor before saving.**

### **Next Steps**

- **Review your existing video lessons and prepare .srt files for each.**

- **Upload subtitles in at least one additional language to improve global accessibility.**

- **Use the Advanced Subtitle Editor to fine-tune content and timing.**

- **Monitor learner engagement to assess the impact of subtitle availability.**

- **Stay tuned for upcoming features such as enhanced course analytics and video embedding via links.**
