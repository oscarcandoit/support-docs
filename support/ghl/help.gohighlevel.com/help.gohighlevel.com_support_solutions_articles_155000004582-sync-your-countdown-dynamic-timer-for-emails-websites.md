## Introduction

We are excited to introduce the Dynamic Timer from Email Builder into Funnels and Website Builder. This powerful feature allows users to create personalized countdown timers that sync across emails and live pages. Whether you are driving urgency for an e-commerce sale, event signup, product launch, or limited availability offer, the Dynamic Timer ensures consistency in timing and messaging.

## How It Works

The Dynamic Timer enables contact-specific countdowns that expire based on when a recipient opens an email. This ensures that each customer sees a unique timer aligned with their email engagement. Additionally, the timer remains synced on live pages, allowing a seamless transition from email promotions to website interactions.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1\. Create a Dynamic Timer in Email Builder

- Navigate to Marketing → Countdown Timers.

- Click Create a New Timer.

- Choose a timer design that fits your campaign.

- Select Dynamic Timer as the timer type.

- Set the countdown duration and expiration time.

- Click Save to finalize the timer.
