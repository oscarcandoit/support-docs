## How to Configure

- **Select Trigger**: In the workflow builder, choose _Opportunity Created_ as your trigger.

- **Assign a Trigger Name**: Give the trigger a meaningful name, such as “High Value Lead Opportunity Created.”

- **Filters**:

  - **Assigned To**: Filter opportunities based on which user it’s assigned to.
  - **Pipeline**: Filter opportunities in specific pipelines.
  - **Lead Value**: Set criteria based on the opportunity’s monetary value.
- **Add Multiple Filters**: If necessary, apply additional filters by clicking **Add filters** and selecting the desired fields and conditions.


## Example

**Scenario**: You want to notify the sales manager when a new opportunity with a lead value greater than $10,000 is created in the pipeline.

- **Trigger**: Opportunity Created
- **Filter**: Lead Value greater than $10,000
- **Action**: Notify the sales manager

This setup ensures that significant opportunities are flagged and acted upon promptly by notifying key stakeholders.
