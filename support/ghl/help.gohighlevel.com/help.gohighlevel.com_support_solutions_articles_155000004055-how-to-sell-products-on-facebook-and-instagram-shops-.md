# **How to connect Facebook/ Instagram Shop to your Highlevel Online store?**

## Step 1: Enable feature via Labs

To use this feature, the **Multiple Facebook Pages** feature should be enabled from Labs which can be found under **Sub-account Settings -> Labs**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036045767/original/l-_HEU29p6sEKsPHRer1ovowa4pWGDuppQ.png?1730827205)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036045904/original/3bq9pZISIt8dcp-nKJDmxDyYYWjZl5ZQFw.jpeg?1730827373)

## Step 2: Access Integration & First-time Connection

Step 2.1. **Accessing Integration:**

to access the integration.

### **Reconnection for existing Facebook/ Instagram integration users**

1. This integration will be only available in the multiple Facebook feature, hence it should be enabled under **Labs** Section
2. In order to enable Shops, the users need to disconnect and reconnect the integration
3. Before re-connecting the integration, the LeadConnector integration should be removed in Facebook side as well. It can be found under **Facebook Profile > settings & privacy > Settings >** **Search for "business integrations"**.
4. Upon connecting again, the **Shops** should get enabled
5. If the necessary scope is not present, then an error state will be shown that the Catalog Management is disabled

## Step 3: Connect Facebook Shop Pages to Online Store

Once the desired shop pages are selected, store owners can link them to their Online stores through the " **Messenger Settings**" in the Facebook and Instagram Integration card. The Shops tab will display the selected pages, which need to be connected to the respective stores for product publishing and syncing.
