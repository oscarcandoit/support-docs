What’s a Category queue?

A category queue is a **powerful way** to plan your evergreen content by re-purposing the already published and future content tagged to a certain category to be re-utilised for publishing on the platforms or add new category with new content.

This would allow us to not just be able to schedule a specific post, but a whole category of posts and the system would cycle through all of the posts until the end and then reset and start again.

?

How it works?

Pre- requisite:

User should have a list of

published

posts

tagged to a category

which can then be utilized as a part of new category queue creation.

1. Navigate to New Post button -> Click on Category Queue option.

2. Select a Category- Choose the desired Category for creating the queue or add new by typing the name of category.

3. Enable Preferences- Enable options like Enable Future Posting or Prioritise Content by checking the corresponding checkboxes.

- Future Posting - adds any upcoming content published or added to the queues
- Prioritise Content- adds the new content to the front of the queue to publish first.

6. Set Posting Schedule- Select the preferred Days and Time for your posts.

7. Edit Content- Review and edit the Media or Content of the posts as needed. There is an option of New Post, this new post will allow users to add new post in queue in any sequence. User can also add multiple content variations to allow them to shuffle the content with media format to build uniqueness.

8. Fix any Errors identified by the caution, error and warning messages.
9. Click Queue Post button to Schedule the posts incase no errors are present.
10. Click Queue Post button to finalise and Save as Draft incase any errors are present. Alternatively, click Cancel to save your progress as a draft for future editing.
11. User can pause or resume the category queues at any given point of time from the 'content' tab by enabling/disabling the toggle.
