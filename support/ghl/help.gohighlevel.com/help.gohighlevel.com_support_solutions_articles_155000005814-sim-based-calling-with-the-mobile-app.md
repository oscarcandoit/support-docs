# SIM-based calling with the Mobile App

Modified on: Thu, 31 Jul, 2025 at 2:41 PM

Skip the copy-paste and dial leads straight from HighLevel or LeadConnector using the mobile number already on your phone plan. SIM-based calling launches your device’s native dialer with the contact’s digits pre-filled, so you can act on opportunities the moment you see them—no business number or extra setup required.

# **What Is SIM-Based Calling?**

SIM-based calling is a one-tap shortcut that hands a lead’s phone number from the HighLevel mobile app to your phone’s built-in dialer. Because the call routes through your personal or carrier-issued SIM, you can start conversations even if your workspace hasn’t purchased a dedicated business line.

```
Important: This will work only when an LC phone is not purchased and active at the sub-account level. Once LC Phone is setup, SIM-based calling is no longer available.
```

* * *

## **Key Benefits of SIM-Based Calling**

Empower your team with friction-free outreach while you work toward a full Voice setup.

- **Zero Setup**: Works automatically before enabling LC Phone

- **Faster Outreach**: One tap launches the dialer with the number pre‑filled, no copy & paste

- **Carrier Billing**: Uses your existing SIM phone billing plan

- **Mobile First Experience:** Perfect for users who live inside the app

- **Bridges the Gap:** Teams can start calling today and upgrade to built-in business numbers later


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Limitations**

- **No LC Phone number** must exist at the sub‑account level. Once a number is purchased, SIM calling is no longer available

- **Standard carrier minutes/charges** apply. Calls are not billed through LC Phone or HighLevel

- **No call recording, transfer, or analytics** are available (these rely on LC Phone)

- **Manual logging** is required to track SIM-based calls in HighLevel


* * *

## **Where You Can Place SIM‑based Calls**

Find the **Call** icon wherever phone numbers surface in the mobile app. This includes:

- **Contacts:** Top-right of the profile header

- **Opportunities:** Inside the Kanban card and detail view

- **Conversations:** Quick-action toolbar above each thread

* * *

## **Manuel Call Logging**

SIM calls are not auto-logged inside HighLevel. Track outcomes manually so your pipeline stays accurate. Here are three easy ways to capture every outcome:

- Tap **Notes** on the contact profile to record outcomes

- **Workflow Action - Log External Call:** Log External Call to attribute manual notes to reporting fields. To learn more, see: [Workflow Action - Log External Call](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002930)

- **Workflow Action - Manual Call:** Manual Call to schedule follow‑ups. To learn more, see: [Workflow Action - Manual Call](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003376)

## **How to Place a SIM-Based Call**

Follow these three moves—no settings to toggle.

1. Open **Contacts**, **Opportunities**, or **Conversations**

2. Tap the **phone** **icon** next to the lead’s number

3. Your device’s dialer pops up with the number pre-filled. Just press the Number to place the call

That’s it! The call uses your carrier minutes or unlimited plan just like any personal call.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does this feature cost anything extra?**

No. Calls use your existing mobile plan minutes or VoLTE data. Nothing is billed through HighLevel.

**Q: Will contacts see my personal caller ID?**

Yes. Because the call originates from your SIM, recipients will see the name or number attached to your carrier line.

**Q: Will HighLevel log my SIM‑based calls?**

A: Automatic logging is only available for LC Phone (VoIP) calls. SIM calls use your carrier network and  calls are not logged automatically through HighLevel. This must be done manually.

**Q: The option to place a SIM-based call disappeared after I bought a LC phone number—why?**

When an LC Phone number is active in a sub‑account, the mobile app defaults to VoIP calling and SIM-based calling is no longer available. SIM-based calling is only meant to be a bridge to use while setting up LC Phone.
