# What Is Layout-Level Visibility in Email Templates?

Previously, users could only control visibility at the element level, which made hiding large sections for mobile or desktop tedious. With this update, you can now apply visibility settings directly to layout blocks, allowing you to show or hide entire sections depending on the device.

## Key Benefits of Layout Visibility Controls

These controls help you build more responsive and device-optimized emails with less effort.

- Save Time – Hide entire sections in one click instead of adjusting elements individually

- Consistency – Unified editing flow between elements and layouts

- Device Optimization – Customize mobile vs desktop versions of your email layout

- Better Previews – Use mobile/desktop views to test visibility logic

- Improved Testing – Send test emails with the correct visibility settings reflected


## How To Use Layout-Level Visibility in Email Templates

1. Create or open an email template in the drag-and-drop builder.

2. Add a layout block to your email design.

3. Hover over the layout — you’ll see desktop and mobile icons appear on the block.





   - Click either icon to toggle visibility for that device.

   - A grayed-out icon indicates that the layout is hidden on that view.
4. Alternatively, click on the layout block and use the Visibility tab in the left-hand panel.

5. Switch between Desktop and Mobile view using the preview icons in the builder toolbar.

6. Send a test email to confirm how visibility behaves in a real inbox.

## Best Practices for Responsive Layouts

To create polished, device-specific email experiences:

- Use desktop-only layouts for wide or multi-column designs.

- Use mobile-only layouts for single-column content or CTA buttons.

- Don’t forget to preview and test send to confirm what’s shown or hidden.

- Pair layout visibility with element-level visibility for extra precision.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What happens if I hide a layout for both desktop and mobile?

The layout will be hidden from all views and will not be sent. Ensure at least one view is active.

Q: Can I adjust element visibility separately inside a layout?

Yes, but if the layout itself is hidden, the visibility of inner elements won’t matter—they will not render.

Q: Are visibility settings reflected in test emails?

Yes. Both desktop and mobile visibility settings are preserved when sending test or live emails.

Q: How is this different from hiding individual elements?

Layout-level visibility saves time by letting you hide entire sections, rather than toggling each component individually.

### Next Steps

- Open an email template and try out layout visibility settings

- Use the desktop/mobile preview toggle to test layout behavior

- Send a test email to validate how your layout appears across devices

- Save time by using layout-level controls instead of adjusting individual elements
