## **Pricing**

Regardless of whether your agency selects **Uberall** or **Yext** as your preferred Listings Management Engine, the pricing remains consistent across both options. You can subscribe to the Listings product at the following rates:

- **$30 for 1 month**
- **$150 for 6 months**
- **$300 for 12 months (1 year)**


This ensures you have complete flexibility in choosing the engine that best suits your clients’ needs, without any cost-based constraints.

* * *

## **Existing Entity Subscriptions**

Already have business entities subscribed to Listings?

- Those will continue to work as-is with the current engine (Yext or Uberall)

- The engine selection **only affects newly created entities** after the selection

- If you with to switch an existing entity to the other engine, you'll need to:




1. **Unsubscribe** it from the current engine

2. **Re-subscribe** it once the agency-level engine is switched

* * *

## **Getting Started**

#### **Engine Selection (Agency-Level Configuration)**

When you first access the Listings product, you will see a modal allowing you to choose between **Uberall** and **Yext** as your preferred Listings Management Engine

```
Important: The selected engine will apply to all your agency's sub-accounts and the business entities they manage. You cannot run listings through both engines in parallel for the same agency.
```

#### **Checkbox Confirmation**

After selecting an engine, you'll need to confirm via checkbox:

_"I understand that this engine will be the default for all new entities my subaccounts create, and agree to move forward with this selection"_

* * *

## **How to Select Your Listings Engine (Agency-Level Setup)**

```
Please note that engine selection is available only at the agency level, and all new sub-accounts and business entities under the agency will automatically inherit this engine.
```

Here’s how to configure your preferred Listings engine:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Reselling

- Log in to your agency dashboard in the HighLevel app

- From the left navigation menu, click on the **Reselling** tab

#### **Step 2:** Open Selection Modal

- Scroll down to locate the **Listings** card

- Click on **C** **hange Engine** to open the selection modal

#### **Step 3:** Choose Preferred Engine

- You’ll see a side-by-side comparison of **Uberall** and **Yext**, including key benefits and differentiators for each

- Choose your preferred engine

- After selecting an engine, confirm using the checkbox after reading the warning

```
Important: Sub-accounts will always experience a white labeled version of the Listings product, so they won’t see the underlying engine name — just a seamless Listings interface powered by your agency’s chosen engine.
```

#### **Step 4:** Confirm Listings Engine

- Once confirmed, the selected engine will begin to reflect on the Listings card as **Powered by Uberall** or **Powered by Yext**

* * *

## **Changing the Engine Later**

While the engine is initially locked in post-selection, **you may request a change via the same engine selector modal for new entities.** Please note:

- All existing entities will still be active on the current engine. This is because switching to a new engine would essentially mean cancelling subscription from one engine and then activating it in the other engine - which may cause publisher data sync delays.,

- The new engine will then become the active one for all future subscriptions.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use Uberall for some sub‑accounts and Yext for others?**

No, you cannot run listings through both engines in parallel for the same agency. You can switch later, but the change is made at the agency level, not the sub-account level.

**Q: What happens to my current listings when I switch engines?**

Those will continue to work as‑is with the current engine (Yext or Uberall). The engine selection only affects newly created entities after the selection.

**Q: Will my clients see Uberall or Yext branding?**

Sub-accounts will always experience a white labeled version of the Listings product, so they won’t see the underlying engine name.
