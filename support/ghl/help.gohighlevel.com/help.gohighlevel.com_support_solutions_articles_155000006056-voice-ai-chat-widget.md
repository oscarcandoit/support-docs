## **What is the Voice AI Chat Widget?**

The Voice AI Chat Widget is a new widget type that lets website visitors hold live, microphone-based conversations with an AI agent entirely inside the browser. Instead of launching a phone call, the conversation streams through WebRTC, creating a friction-free, voice-first experience that feels natural and immediate.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Voice Widget**

Voice AI turns your standard chat bubble into a real-time conversation booth:

- Zero friction – visitors speak instantly without dialing a number or installing an app.

- Human-like engagement – natural speech keeps prospects talking longer and sharing more details.

- Higher conversion – real-time voice qualifies and books leads while interest is hot.

- Brandable agent name – display a friendly persona (e.g., “BuilderAi”) right in the widget.

- Built-in security – reCAPTCHA throttles abuse; a call-recording disclaimer ensures compliance.

* * *

## **Voice-Only Chat Type**

Voice-only mode streams audio through the visitor’s mic and speakers so the entire call lives inside the chat window—no PSTN or VoIP connection required. This makes it ideal for quick demos, support triage, or hands-free sales conversations.

* * *

## **How to Change the AI Agent Name**

Give your AI a friendly, on-brand identity by setting a display name in the widget builder (Sites > Chat Widgets > Agent tab). The chosen name appears on every voice reply, reinforcing trust and professionalism.

Changing the name of your Chat Widget Agent is easy and can be done directly in the web chat builder! To change the name, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Chat Widgets

From your location dashboard, go to **Sites → Chat Widgets**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058034812/original/lA_hzlt8-FeAZUKgtGc2I3y7JFayR4Q6GA.jpeg?1762808559)**

#### **Step 2:** Open Your Widget

Click on the widget to open the editor

#### **Step 3:** Update Name

- Navigate to the **Agent** tab

- Use the **Voice AI Agent Name** box to enter a new name for the agent

#### **Step 4:** Save Changes

Once the name has been changed, apply your changes by clicking the blue **Save** button in the upper right corner.

* * *

## **Built-In Call-Recording Notice**

To keep expectations clear, the widget surfaces a banner that reads “All voice AI calls made using chat widgets cannot be recorded.” This transparency protects both you and your visitors from compliance confusion.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055869030/original/y7dhmiDGwsAFK3nECxwOCxTCw8AFOk6d7w.png?1760363140)

* * *

## **reCAPTCHA Protection**

If a visitor connects or disconnects 10 times within 60 seconds, the system prompts Google reCAPTCHA to confirm they’re human, stopping bot loops and malicious toll-free abuse before it starts.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055868854/original/GyZ2Wnh0gLgHakAU6m9RdswMxwbZaGn2zg.png?1760363059)

* * *

## **Browser-Based Engagement**

Because everything runs in-browser via WebRTC, there’s no telephony setup, SIP trunk, or softphone to configure. Agencies can embed the widget anywhere a normal HighLevel chat bubble fits—websites, funnels, blogs, or the Client Portal.

* * *

## **Concurrent Call Limit**

The number of concurrent calls is **capped at 20.** Call #21 will trigger the red banner shown in the examples below. Calls in other locations are unaffected as they each have their own 20 call limit.

This safeguard prevents quality degradation when multiple website visitors call at once.

Note: Call transfer is not yet supported while in beta.

## **How to Set Up the Voice Widget**

A correct setup ensures that the Voice Widget works smoothly on your website. The process is simple and requires adding a script to your site’s code.

1\. Navigate to **Sites → Chat Widget** → **New** → **Voice AI** as the widget type.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055871597/original/mx3uGUCZPCRhUwDY74ExLLKIyM5mUcZM9A.png?1760364206)

2\. Locate the **Get Code** option and copy the provided`<script>`code.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055871718/original/qN1YE35rbauwOgS5BDAh661pGpXP75kk3g.png?1760364257)

3\. Paste the script into your website:

- For custom-coded sites, place it in the`<head>`or`<footer>`section.

- For platforms like **Wix, Shopify,** and **Squarespace**, use their custom code embed feature.


```
Note: Save and publish your changes. Test the widget by visiting your live site and starting a voice call.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do visitors have to grant mic permission every time?**

Most modern browsers remember permission after the first allow, but private/incognito sessions will ask again.

**Q: Can I offer both text chat and Voice AI in one widget?**

Not yet. Voice AI is currently a dedicated “Voice-Only” widget type. Use separate widgets (text vs. voice) if you need both.

**Q: Is the audio recorded anywhere in HighLevel?**

No. Voice AI Chat Widget calls are streamed only; recording is disabled to comply with privacy regulations.

**Q: What happens if the visitor’s connection drops?**

The call ends gracefully. The visitor can click the mic icon to reconnect; repeated drops trigger reCAPTCHA.

**Q: Does Voice AI work on mobile browsers?**

Yes—Safari (iOS 16+), Chrome, and Edge support in-browser audio as long as the user allows microphone access.

**Q: Can agencies set different AI agents for different pages?**

Absolutely. Create multiple Voice AI widgets—each with its own agent persona—and embed the appropriate script on each page.
