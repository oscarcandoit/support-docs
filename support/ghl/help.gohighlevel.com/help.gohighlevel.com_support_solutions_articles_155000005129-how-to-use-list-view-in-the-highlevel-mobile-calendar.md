# **What is List View in the Mobile Calendar?**

List View is a new calendar display format available in the HighLevel and LeadConnector **mobile apps**. Unlike the traditional grid-based layouts (monthly or weekly), List View displays your calendar events in a **chronologically ordered, scrollable feed**. This setup eliminates visual clutter and allows users to focus on what’s coming up—event by event—especially helpful when using a smaller screen.

## **Key Benefits of Using List View**

**List View is optimized for clarity, speed, and ease-of-use, especially on smaller screens. Here’s why you’ll love it:**

- **Linear Planning**: View events in a straightforward, top-to-bottom list—no calendar grid needed.

- **Mobile-Friendly Display**: Makes the most of limited screen space by minimizing visual distractions.

- **Scroll-Based Navigation**: Browse through your full calendar by simply scrolling—no need to tap between days.

- **Focus-Friendly**: Easily focus on today’s agenda or scroll ahead to prepare for future events.

- **Smooth Toggle Access**: Quickly switch between List View and other views with a single tap.


## **How To Switch to List View in the Mobile Calendar**

**Switching to List View is simple and only takes a few taps, giving you instant access to your full calendar in an easy-to-read format.**

1. **Open the HighLevel mobile app** and go to the **Calendar Module**.

3. **Select “List View”** from the dropdown menu.

4. Your calendar will now show events in a **vertically stacked list** organized by date and time.

5. **Scroll down** to browse upcoming events or **scroll up** to view recent activity.

6. To switch back to a grid-based view, simply repeat these steps and select “Monthly View” or “Weekly View”.


## **Feature Highlight: Perfect for Mobile Planning**

**List View is tailor-made for mobile users who want efficiency, visibility, and control in one clean layout.**

On smaller screens, the traditional grid views can feel dense and harder to interpret. With List View, every event is given its own space, and users can move fluidly through their schedule. Whether you’re checking what’s next today or planning out next week, List View simplifies the process and removes friction from your workflow.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is List View available on desktop or only mobile?**

A: List View is currently available in the **mobile version only** (HighLevel and LeadConnector apps). Desktop support may be evaluated in future updates.

**Q: Can I switch back to the monthly calendar view?**

A: Yes! Just tap the same view toggle and choose “Monthly” or “Weekly” to return to the grid layout.

**Q: What types of events are shown in List View?**

A: All types of events—tasks, bookings, appointments—are included in the List View feed.

**Q: Can I filter or search within List View?**

A: Filters are not yet supported in List View, but you can scroll to find your events or use search within the calendar module.
