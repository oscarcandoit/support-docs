## **What is the New Courses Dashboard?**

The New Courses Dashboard is the default “welcome page” for every course creator in HighLevel. It replaces the legacy SQL-powered view to surface enrolment, revenue, and engagement metrics in near real-time. Built with the Highrise UI design system, the dashboard is fully responsive and refreshes its data every six hours to keep insights current.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the New Courses Dashboard**

- Instant 30-day snapshot of your top and bottom-performing courses.

- **Unified revenue analytics**—Total Revenue, Checkouts, AOV, and more.

- Visual funnel to spot where learners drop off (sign-up → start → completion).

- Personalized empty-state and “Getting Started” cards for new creators.

- Click-through cards that open deeper member or revenue analytics in one click.

* * *

## **Top & Least Performing Courses**

These cards highlight which courses are performing best and which need attention based on enrollment and completion data.

1. **Top Performing Course**: Displays the course with the highest engagement in the past 30 days.

2. **Least Performing Course**: Displays the course with the lowest engagement or completion rate.

3. **Metrics shown**:




   - **Completion Rate** – percentage of enrolled learners who completed the course.

   - **Enrollments** – total number of learners who enrolled.

Clicking on the course name will take you to the Course Details Page, where you can analyze engagement, content, and completion performance in depth.

## **Revenue Generated**

This section gives you a quick snapshot of total earnings from your courses.

- **Revenue Generated ($)** – total amount earned in the last 30 days.

- **vs Last Month** – percentage change compared to the previous month.

- **Total Checkouts**– total number of completed purchases.

- **Upsell Conversions**– number of successful upsells made through course offers.

**Navigation**: Click “ **Go to Revenue**” to access detailed revenue analytics, transaction breakdowns, and learner purchase history.

* * *

## **Average Order Value (AOV)**

This card shows how much revenue you earn on average per learner.

- **AOV per User**– average order value calculated as total revenue divided by total learners.

- **Highest Order Value** – the largest single transaction recorded in the past 30 days.

- **vs Last Month** – change percentage compared to the previous period.

## **Course Progress Funnel**

This visualization helps you track how learners move through your course journey — from signing up to completing the course.

- **Signed Up** – number of learners who registered for your courses.

- **Started** – learners who began engaging with lessons or modules.

- **Completed** – learners who finished the course.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056150332/original/BX6Rwm-mlX4Vjz_uazL89WQgyB-QOjR1gQ.png?1760620347)

The Cumulative % on the right side shows the proportion of learners who progressed to each stage.

**Navigation**: Click “ **Go to Funnel**” to view detailed course progress analytics, learner-level data, and export reports.

## **Tips for Using the Dashboard**

- Use the Top vs. Least Performing Course data to decide where to invest your optimization efforts.

- Monitor Revenue and AOV trends monthly to measure the impact of pricing or promotional changes.

- Review the Course Progress Funnel frequently to identify where learners drop off and improve completion rates.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to migrate anything to use the new dashboard?**

No. All existing course data is automatically updated; the dashboard appears the next time you open Courses.

**Q: Why don’t I see any revenue data?**

Revenue cards only populate once at least one paid checkout is processed through HighLevel Payments or Stripe.

**Q: Can I export the dashboard data?**

Yes. Click Export → CSV in the upper-right corner to download 30-day aggregates.

**Q: How do I change which metrics appear?**

Metric tiles are fixed for now, but deeper custom reports are coming soon as part of Advanced Analytics.

**Q: Will this impact my monthly API limits?**

No. Dashboard queries run server-side; they don’t count toward API allotments.

**Q: Is the dashboard available on mobile?**

Absolutely. Highrise UI ensures full responsiveness on tablets and phones.

**Q: Where can I manage multiple courses at once?**

Use Kollab Studio for bulk course management tasks such as publish/unpublish or price edits.
