# **What is Comment Management?**

Comment Management in Social Planner helps you view and respond to comments from your posts, all in one dashboard. Instead of jumping between social media platforms, you can now manage conversations directly where you schedule and plan content.

```
Note: Currently, only comments from posts published via Social Planner are supported. Comments on posts published natively (directly in Facebook etc) will not appear here. Support for other social platforms is in progress.
```

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Comment Management**

- **One-Stop Inbox:** View every Facebook comment alongside scheduled posts.

- **Real-Time Engagement:** Keep engagement consistent by liking and replying to comments.

- **Conversation Context:** Manage deeper discussions with threaded (nested) replies.

- **Ti** **me-Savings:** Save time by replying without leaving Social Planner.

* * *

## **Limitations of Comment Management**

- Nested comment counts are not displayed (only main thread counts).

- Thumbnails, images, videos, and GIFs in comments are **not clickable**.

- Options to add GIFs, stickers, or avatars in replies are not supported.

- Images larger than **10MB** cannot be uploaded (limitation from Facebook).

- Search requires a **minimum of 3 characters**.


* * *

## **What You Can Do in Comment Management**

These capabilities streamline day-to-day engagement so you can respond faster, keep conversations organized, and highlight high-value interactions without leaving HighLevel.

### **Replying to Comments**

Respond to any top-level comment directly from Social Planner, preserving author names, emojis, and GIFs for a native feel. Fast, on-brand replies strengthen relationships and can drive additional engagements or DMs.

### **Liking Comments**

A quick “like” lets followers know you’ve seen and appreciated their input. Every like is recorded on Facebook and contributes to post engagement metrics, further improving reach.

### **Responding to Threaded Comments**

Threaded replies keep multi-person conversations organized. Click the arrow beside a parent comment to view and answer sub-threads so your replies appear precisely where the discussion is happening.

### **Smart Filters (Latest vs Top)**

Use the dropdown above the inbox to switch views:

- Latest: Shows the most recent activity so you never miss new questions.

- Top: Sorts by Facebook’s “most relevant” order, surfacing high-engagement comments first.

### **Using Mentions in Comment Replies**

Tag Facebook Pages or public profiles by typing “@” plus at least three characters. A list of matching public pages appears, allowing you to credit partners or acknowledge customers without leaving HighLevel.
