## **Introduction**

The Affiliate Manager is a powerful tool that enables businesses to grow their reach by leveraging a network of affiliates. It allows companies to incentivize third-party individuals or entities to promote their products or services in exchange for a commission. By using affiliate marketing, businesses can access new markets, increase sales, and only pay for actual results—making it a cost-effective way to scale.

## **How the Affiliate Manager Works**

1. **Create Your First Campaign :** Start by setting up your first affiliate campaign. Choose the products you want to promote, define commission rates, and invite affiliates to join the campaign. Once the campaign is live, each enrolled affiliate will receive a unique affiliate link. This link is crucial as it tracks leads and sales attributed to the affiliate.

2. **Track Leads :** Affiliates share their unique link with their network. Whenever someone clicks on the link and shows interest by filling out a form or booking a calendar appointment, they become a lead. Admins can also add leads manually.

3. **Lead-to-Customer Conversion :** When a lead makes a purchase, they are automatically converted to a customer under the affiliate whose link they used.

4. **Commission and Payouts :** Once a sale is made, the system calculates the commission for the affiliate. The affiliate owner (you) can then review the list of payouts and either approve or deny them.

5. **Easy Payment Processing :** After approval, you can either automate affiliate payouts using PayPal or manually process the payments using your own payment gateway. Manual payout options include but not limited to Stripe, bank transfer, Wise, check etc.

## **Business Benefits**

- **Expand Your Reach**: Leverage affiliates to promote your products to new audiences.

- **Performance-Based**: Only pay for successful sales, minimizing upfront costs.

- **Automated Management**: The system tracks leads, sales, and commissions, saving you time and effort.

- **Incentivize Growth**: Affiliates are motivated to increase their efforts as their earnings grow with each successful sale.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do affiliates track the sales they generate?**

Each affiliate receives a unique link when they join a campaign. This link tracks leads and sales, ensuring the correct affiliate is credited for conversions.

**Q: How are affiliate commissions and payouts handled?**

When a lead converts into a customer, the system calculates the affiliate’s commission. You can then approve or deny payouts, and process payments either automatically via PayPal or manually using options like Stripe, bank transfer, Wise, or check.

**Q: Can leads be added to the system without an affiliate link?**

Yes. While most leads come through affiliate links, admins also have the option to add leads manually.
