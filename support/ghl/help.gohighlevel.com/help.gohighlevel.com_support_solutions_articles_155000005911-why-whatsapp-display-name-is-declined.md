# Why WhatsApp Display Name is Declined

Modified on: Mon, 11 Aug, 2025 at 9:52 PM

When your Display name shows **“Declined”** in GHL. It means that the **WhatsApp Business Profile (Display Name)** was rejected during Meta’s review process.

### **Why It Was Declined**

When you connect a number to the WhatsApp Business API, Meta reviews the Display Name to ensure it follows the **WhatsApp Commerce Policy** and **Business Policy**. If the name does not meet the requirements, it gets declined.

**Common reasons for decline:**

- Display Name is **too generic** or **misleading**

- Name **does not match** your legal business name or documentation

- Use of restricted terms like **“Official”**, **“Global”**, or **unsupported symbols**


**No strong association** between the Display Name and your verified business assets (Facebook Page, Business Manager)

### **How to Fix**

1. **Resubmit** the Display Name in Business Manager.

2. If it’s a one-word brand name, avoid spaces.

3. Avoid using emojis, slogans, or unnecessary capitalization.

4. Ensure a strong link to your verified business assets.


**Example:**

If your legal business name is _Owner Connector Solutions Ltd_, use:

- ✅ **Owner Connector**

- ✅ **OwnerConnector Solutions**

- ❌ **OwnerConnector Official**


**Reference:** [Meta’s Display Name Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757569725593362)
