# **What is this feature?**

The Conversation AI is an advanced feature that leverages AI technologies to enhance customer interactions and automate the appointment booking process. It consists of two primary modes:

## **Suggestive Mode:**

In this mode, AI generates real-time predictive text suggestions to assist users in responding to customer messages. The suggestions appear as options, allowing users to either send the AI-suggested message as is, customize it before sending it, or dismiss the suggestion.

## **Auto-Pilot Mode:**

This mode fully automates responses to inbound messages using AI to guide customers toward booking appointments. If an inbound message is received, the system waits 2 minutes before calling the GPT API to account for multiple potential messages.

**Please note:**

```
The availability of the Auto-Pilot mode will be limited to a private beta for now and a select group of users has been shortlisted for testing and feedback purposes., while the Suggestive mode will be accessible for all users.
```

The system design follows certain conditions for start, sleep, and end states, including manual user intervention, out-of-context responses, and appointment link delivery. It uses the last 10 conversations or up to an 800-word limit for prompt engineering, ensuring context-sensitive responses.

This feature can be integrated into a variety of live channels, including SMS, Google My Business (GMB), Facebook (FB), and Instagram (IG). It employs advanced usage and pricing models based on message generation while also providing the capability for performance tracking with detailed metrics.

## **Usage Cases:**

### **Suggestive Mode:**

**Healthcare Clinic:**

A local healthcare clinic can utilize Conversation AI in suggestive mode to streamline appointment bookings. When patients inquire about service details or available appointment slots, the AI responds promptly with relevant information and suggests appropriate responses. This improves response time and enhances the patient experience.

**Fitness Center:**

Conversation AI in suggestive mode efficiently handles inquiries and bookings for a fitness center offering various classes and membership plans. Potential clients asking about class schedules or membership details receive instant responses from the AI and suggestions for further actions. The suggestive mode allows staff to quickly respond to queries and provide personalized assistance.

**Restaurant:**

Restaurants benefit from Conversation AI in suggestive mode to manage table reservation requests. When customers inquire about table availability, the AI responds with available time slots and provides suggestions for booking. Additionally, the suggestive mode assists staff in promptly responding to unique requests, such as dietary restrictions or special arrangements.

### **Auto-Pilot Mode (Private Beta):**

**Healthcare Clinic:**

With Conversation AI in auto-pilot mode, a local healthcare clinic can automate responses to inbound messages, guiding patients toward booking appointments. The AI provides available timings, guides patients in selecting a slot, and sends them a booking link. This mode reduces manual intervention and ensures a seamless appointment booking process.

**Fitness Center:**

In auto-pilot mode (private beta), Conversation AI automates responses for a fitness center. When potential clients message about class schedules or membership plans, the AI guides them toward booking a trial class or membership. This mode lets staff focus on other tasks while maintaining an efficient customer booking process.

**Restaurant:**

In auto-pilot mode (private beta), Conversation AI handles restaurant table reservation requests. When customers inquire about table availability, the AI provides time slots and directs them to a booking link. The auto-pilot mode ensures a prompt and streamlined reservation process.

**Real Estate Agency:**

Conversation AI in auto-pilot mode (private beta) assists real estate agencies in managing property viewing appointments. When potential buyers inquire about properties, the AI autonomously provides relevant property details and available viewing slots, and guides buyers toward scheduling a viewing. This mode simplifies the appointment booking process for agents and potential buyers.

# **How to enable Conversation AI in your Agency?**

To enable Conversation AI in your agency, follow these steps:

Navigate to your agency settings in the left sidebar.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001430058/original/oTUIoMJa-RGfkK4OTlYeDqRSGRV2LeY7Ow.png?1687286302)

Head to Company Settings and then scroll down on the right.

There should be an option or checkbox to enable or activate Conversation AI. Click this to turn on the feature.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001430126/original/1Bmlvi7IJ6qxU89hmqZA5Ci8cdDFW_JlbQ.png?1687286456)

You must accept the terms and conditions or acknowledge the costs of enabling this feature.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001430140/original/UIV6Mp7Zohblg9dzul4BOtG1q1ruKMsrxQ.png?1687286503)

Once you have done that, please click on **Enable.**

# **How to Rebill Conversation AI?**

Adjust Rebill Amount: This step is crucial if you plan to rebill your customers for using the AI service.

Head to the **SAAS Configurator** in your Agency Sidebar. Scroll down on the right to Conversation AI.

Enter the amount you plan to charge your customers per message. For instance, if your cost is $0.05 per message and you want to profit, you could charge customers $0.07.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001429891/original/qOMTBMN73VGuZxL9YhtvDerVKlOeo_K1rg.png?1687286049)

In this rebilling example, you, as an agency, bear the $0.05/message cost. You then charge your customer $0.07/message, 1.4 times your cost. This results in a profit of $0.02/message. With $10, you can generate approximately 145 messages.

You can change the rebilling multiplier for individual SAAS accounts by heading to **Sub-Accounts> Scrolling to that sub-account> Manage Client** (or clicking on their name.)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001430551/original/uXBzpgTKIVl-MudMuXjzapGgS6GIBhuQJg.png?1687287227)

Scroll down till you see the sub-accounts rebilling management area> **Conversation AI:**

### **Appointment Booking:**

#### **Pick a Calendar**

In the "Appointment Booking" section, you're asked to pick a calendar from your CRM. The associated scheduling link is automatically selected when you select a specific calendar. This link is then used in the bot's replies for customers to book appointments, enabling seamless integration of your CRM's scheduling capabilities with the Conversation AI's automated customer interaction.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001431786/original/Wl4TnKnh1qyKTexMW6zSRgefA0-aOj1_Sw.png?1687290044)

#### **Conversation flow**

In the "Conversation Flow" section, you can guide the AI bot's dialogue with your customers. It will ask the specified questions before sharing the booking link with the contact. The remaining word count indicates how many more words you can utilize for this dialogue customization.

Example flow:

"Do you require the services offered by ARNOLD GYM?"

"Do you require these services in the locations my business operates in?"

"Do you wish to book an appointment?"![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001432531/original/MHGikOZPPAxRiN--ZFJs-Q8S3eRMnyrcHg.png?1687291672)

#### **Customize Bot Responses**

In the "Customize Bot Responses" section, you can use the "+ Add Q & A" button to incorporate frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their responses. This trains the bot to handle queries effectively. For instance:

Question: "What are the operational hours of ARNOLD GYM?"

Answer: "ARNOLD GYM operates from 6 AM to 10 PM daily."

These settings ensure the AI bot can handle a broad range of customer inquiries and respond accurately, contributing to a smooth user experience.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001432559/original/gLGLNC456Gt7q6VC2YVLDqi7A4qMTsy0CA.png?1687291686)
