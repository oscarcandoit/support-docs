# New Footer in Surveys

Modified on: Mon, 23 Oct, 2023 at 1:31 PM

You can now tailor your survey footer by customizing themes, background, font, height, progress bar, button color, and position, allowing it to align seamlessly with your brand identity. Choose from various themes, including progress bars, and enjoy real-time previews for instant feedback. The footer can also stick to each slide, ensuring a smooth user experience. New surveys will have these customization options enabled by default, while existing surveys can be upgraded to benefit from the enhanced footer features.
