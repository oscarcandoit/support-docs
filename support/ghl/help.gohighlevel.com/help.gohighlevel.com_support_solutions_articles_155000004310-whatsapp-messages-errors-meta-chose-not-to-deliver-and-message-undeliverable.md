# WhatsApp Messages Errors: Meta Chose Not to Deliver and Message Undeliverable

Modified on: Mon, 2 Dec, 2024 at 3:59 AM

## **Meta Chose Not to Deliver**

### **What it Means**

This error indicates that the message was not delivered by Meta to maintain a healthy ecosystem of engagement. It primarily applies to marketing template messages that are subject to **Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits**.

### **Why it Occurs**

- WhatsApp may limit the number of marketing template messages delivered to users who are less likely to engage.
- This measure improves user experience by maximizing message engagement and minimizing unwanted messages.

### **How to Resolve**

1. **Do Not Retry Immediately:**

   - If you receive this error, avoid retrying immediately. Instead, retry in gradually increasing time increments until the message is delivered.
   - This ensures compliance with Meta’s limits and prevents further disruptions.
2. **Understand Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits:**

   - Marketing messages are restricted based on user engagement patterns.
   - If a marketing conversation is open, one additional marketing message can be sent without triggering the limit.
   - Unlimited free-form messages can be sent once the user responds.

### **Best Practices**

- Ensure marketing messages are timely, relevant, and expected to improve user engagement.
- Use personalized messages that add value, such as information related to recent purchases or exclusive offers.
- Monitor message delivery and engagement to adjust your messaging strategy proactively.

### **Why It’s Important**

- Following these limits improves user sentiment, read rates, and the overall experience for WhatsApp users.
- High-quality engagements make your business eligible for more features on the WhatsApp Business Platform.

## **Message Undeliverable**

### **What it Means**

This error occurs when a message cannot be delivered due to specific reasons, including:

- The recipient's phone number is not a registered WhatsApp number.
- The recipient has not accepted WhatsApp's latest Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
- The recipient is using an outdated version of the WhatsApp application.

### **How to Resolve**

1. **Verify Recipient Details:**

   - Confirm that the recipient’s phone number is registered on WhatsApp.
   - If sending an authentication template, note that these cannot currently be sent to users in India.
2. **Ensure Compliance with WhatsApp Terms and Updates:**

   - Verify that the recipient has accepted WhatsApp’s latest Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
   - Ask recipients to update their WhatsApp client to the latest version:
     - Android: 2.21.15.15 or later
     - iOS: 2.21.170.4 or later
     - KaiOS: 2.2130.10 or later
3. **Validate Communication:**

   - Confirm that the recipient can send a message to your WhatsApp business phone number.
   - Use non-WhatsApp communication channels to guide recipients in resolving issues with their WhatsApp accounts.

## **Tips for Driving High-Quality Conversations and Improving Quality Ratings**

Maintaining a high-quality message rating is crucial for minimizing delivery errors and enhancing user satisfaction. Follow these best practices to optimize your messaging strategy:

### **Creating High-Quality Business-Initiated Conversations**

- **Expected:** Obtain explicit user opt-in for receiving WhatsApp messages.
- **Timely:** Relate messages to time-sensitive topics like recent purchases or seasonal offers.
- **Relevant:** Use personalized content with a clear call-to-action.

### **Improving Quality Ratings**

1. **Opt-In Management:**

   - Send messages only to users who have opted in.
   - Provide clear opt-out options to improve user sentiment.
2. **Engaging Content:**

   - Make messages timely, relevant, and personalized.
   - Avoid overwhelming users with frequent messages.
3. **Monitor and Adjust:**

   - Track your 30-day quality history and reasons for low or medium quality ratings.
   - Experiment with templates and refine strategies based on user engagement data.
4. **Template Review:**

   - Audit new templates added in the past 7 days to identify any causing issues.
   - Ensure compliance with WhatsApp Business and Commerce Policies.
