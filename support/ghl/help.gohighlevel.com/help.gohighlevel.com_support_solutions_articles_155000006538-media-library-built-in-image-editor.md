# **What is the Built-In Image Editor in Media Library?**

The Built-In Image Editor is a lightweight, on-screen workspace embedded in the Media Library. It focuses on essential adjustments that marketers and teams routinely need, helping you prep images right before publishing without downloading files or opening third‑party apps. The editor opens from any image in the Media Library after you click Edit, rendering a modal with tools for crop, rotate, flip, brightness, and contrast, plus undo/redo and save options.

## **Key Benefits of the Built-In Image Editor**

- **Work Inside HighLevel:** Eliminate external tools and context switching.

- **Cleaner Asset Management:** Replace or save as new to prevent duplicate clutter.

- **On-brand Visuals:** Adjust right before publishing to maintain consistency.

- **Lower Storage Overhead:** Avoid multiple near-duplicate uploads.

- **Faster multi-module workflows:** Edited images are immediately available anywhere the Media Library appears (e.g., Social Planner, Funnels, Email Builder).
