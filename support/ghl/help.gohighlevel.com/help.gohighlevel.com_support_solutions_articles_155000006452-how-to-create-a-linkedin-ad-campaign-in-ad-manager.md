# How to create a LinkedIn ad campaign in Ad Manager

Modified on: Mon, 29 Sep, 2025 at 7:40 AM

Ad Manager organizes LinkedIn advertising into a **three-level hierarchy**:

- **Campaign Group** : The top-level container.

- **Campaign** : Defines budget, audience, and scheduling.

- **Ad** : Defines creatives (media, text, CTA, forms).


This guide walks you through **creating a Campaign Group** and then building campaigns and ads inside it.
