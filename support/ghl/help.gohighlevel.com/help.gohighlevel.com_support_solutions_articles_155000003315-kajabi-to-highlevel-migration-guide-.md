# **Preparation for Migration**

### **Step 1:** Review Current Kajabi Setup

- **Identify Key Assets:** List all courses, offers, automations, and other digital assets in Kajabi.

- **Document Workflows:** Record details of Kajabi automations, email campaigns, and integrations that are critical to your operations.

- **Assess Data Volume:** Evaluate the amount of content (e.g., videos, attachments) and data (e.g., contacts, orders) to be migrated.

### **Step 2:** Define Migration Goals

- **Set Clear Objectives:** Determine what you aim to achieve by migrating to HighLevel, such as enhanced CRM capabilities, integrated marketing automation, or cost savings.

- **Prioritize Features:** Decide which content and workflows are most critical to migrate first.

### **Step 3:** Prepare Backup

- **Backup Data:** Ensure all data is securely backed up before beginning the migration process.

* * *

# **Migrate Courses**

HighLevel’s Kajabi Importer allows you to easily transfer courses, including videos, text, and images. Note that assignments and quizzes will not be transferred automatically and will need to be recreated manually within HighLevel.

### **Step 1:** Setup for Success

- **Create a Backup**: Before starting, make a backup of your Kajabi themes and course content so you have a copy.

- **Plan the Migration**: Start the migration during off-hours to reduce any disruption for learners and keep the process smooth.

### **Step 2:** Migrate Courses to HighLevel

- **Use the Kajabi Course Importer**: Go to **Sites > Memberships** in HighLevel and select **Import from Kajabi**.

- **Authenticate Your Kajabi Account**: Follow the steps to securely connect your Kajabi account.

- **Select Courses to Import**: Choose which courses you want to transfer. Only **published lessons** will be brought over, so make sure all content is live.

- **Start the Import**: Click **Import Course** and wait for the process to finish. It might take a few minutes, depending on the course size.

### **Step 3:** Recreate Assignments and Quizzes in HighLevel

1. **Choose a Product**




   - Go to **Sites > Memberships > Products** in HighLevel.

   - Select the product where you want to add an assessment.

   - Click the "+" icon next to the section title and choose **Add Assessment**.
2. **Create an Assessment**




   - Enter a **Title** for your assessment and click **Save**.
3. **Set Passing Grade (Optional)**:




   - Decide if the assessment needs a passing grade.

   - If yes, set the **minimum score** required to pass.
4. **Custom Messages**:




   - Create **pass/fail messages** based on student scores.
5. **Add Questions**:




   - Choose either **Single Choice** (one correct answer) or **Multiple Choice** (multiple correct answers).

   - Type your question and use **"Add choice"** to enter possible answers.

   - Mark the correct option(s) using the **“Correct Option”** checkbox.
6. **Save & Publish the Assessment**:




   - Go back to the **Product Editing Page** after saving.

   - Click on the **“Publish”** option next to your Assessment when it’s ready to go live.

   - Once published, the assessment will be **visible and accessible** to all course members

# **Migrate Contacts**

### **Step 1:** Export Contact List from Kajabi

- Navigate to the **Contacts** tab in Kajabi.

- Select all contacts and use the **bulk action dropdown** to export as a CSV file.

- The CSV file will be emailed to the address associated with the Kajabi account. Download this file promptly as the link expires in 3 days.

### **Step 2:** Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import

- **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.

- **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.

- **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.

- **Recreate Custom Fields:** Log in to HighLevel and navigate to **Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields**. Add custom fields to store contact data in a similar way to how they were stored in Kajabi.

### **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel

- **Log in to HighLevel:** Navigate to the **Contacts** section using the left-hand menu.

- **Start Import Process:** Click the **Import Contacts** button.

- **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.

- **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.




  - _**Field Mapping Tip:** Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding._
- **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as "Course A - Enrolled" or “Imported from Kajabi.”

- **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.

# **Migrate Calendars**

Like HighLevel, Appointments in Kajabi support **one time and recurring events**. Migrate 3rd party calendars such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook to prevent double booking in HighLevel Calendars.

- **Add Calendar Integrations**: Go to **Subaccount Settings > Calendars > Connections** to sync your Google or Outlook calendars with HighLevel.

- **Set Up Recurring Appointments**: For repeating events, manually configure recurrence rules in the HighLevel calendar settings.

- **Preview and Test**: Verify that your new calendars work as expected by comparing them with the existing Kajabi setup.

### **Step 3:** Customize Your HighLevel Calendars

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042993818/original/cSMywtXZgOfxm3YOyqXyqzTMpt6ABNB9SA.png?1741632258)

### **Step 1:** Recreate Website Pages and Funnels in HighLevel

- **Access the Site Builder**: Navigate to **Sites > Funnels & Websites** in HighLevel to get started.

- **Use the Template Library**: Browse and choose templates that best match your Kajabi pages. This will speed up your setup and maintain a cohesive design. [Learn more about the Template Library here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001236650-how-does-the-template-library-work-#How-to-access-the-Template-Library-in-Funnels-and-Websites).

- **Build Each Page**: Recreate key pages from Kajabi, such as your homepage, product pages, landing pages, and contact pages. Utilize **pre-built blocks** to replicate sections like hero banners, testimonials, and contact forms.

### **Step 2:** Save, Draft, and Publish Your Pages

- As you build each page or funnel, **Save your work**, **Preview** changes, and **Publish** once you’re ready. This ensures that every change is live when you want it to be. For more guidance, visit [Saving and Publishing Pages](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001913-save-draft-and-publish-funnels-and-websites).

### **Step 3:** Set up DNS Records

- **Add an A Record**: Use `162.159.140.166`for root domains or subdomains.




  - _**Example:** [yoursitename.com](http://text.yoursitename.com/)_

  - _**Note:** If using Cloudflare, set the **Proxy Status** to **DNS Only** as HighLevel does not support Cloudflare Proxy._
- **Add a CNAME Record**: Use `sites.ludicrous.cloud`for subdomains in your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy or Cloudflare).




  - _**Example:** sometext [.yoursitename.com](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/about%3Ablank)_

### **Step 4:** Add the Domain to HighLevel

- Go to **Settings > Domains**, then click **\+ Add Domain**.

- Enter your domain (e.g., `mydomain.com`) or subdomain (e.g., `offer.mydomain.com`) and select **Add Record Manually**.

- For root domains, enable the **www redirect** to point traffic to your main domain.

### **Step 5:** Link the Domain to a Funnel or Website

- After DNS verification, select which funnel or website to associate with the domain.

- Choose the **default landing page** for the domain (e.g., homepage).

- Click **Link Domain**. The system will automatically add an SSL certificate, which may take a few minutes to process.

```
