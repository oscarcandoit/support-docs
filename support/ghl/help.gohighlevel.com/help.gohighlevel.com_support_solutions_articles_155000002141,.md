# Marketplace App Distribution Type

Modified on: Fri, 11 Jul, 2025 at 6:07 PM

Below is a developer-facing guide covering both the new, simplified Marketplace distribution model and the OAuth flow you’ll need to implement to obtain the correct access tokens.

## App Distribution Model

To configure your desired app distribution model, you have three fields:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Values | Description |
| Who is the target user of the app? | ‘Agency’ / ‘Sub-account’ | - Who is going to interact with the app? <br>  <br>- In other words, whose access token does the app ultimately need?<br>  <br>- For 95% of the apps, this would be **“Sub-account” (Recommended)**<br>  <br>- This field cannot be modified once set. |
| Who can install the app? | ‘Both Agency and Sub-account’ / ‘Agency Only’ | - Which user(s) may see and install the app from the Marketplace UI?<br>  <br>- The **recommended option is “Both Agency & Sub-account”**, to ensure your app has the maximum reach<br>  <br>- Use "Agency Only" If you’re build an app exclusively as a fully white-labelled SaaS feature that only agencies can discover and install to their sub-accounts. |
| Can this app be bulk-installed by agencies? | ‘Yes’ / ‘No’ | - This is **purely for backwards compatibility** of apps already in the Marketplace. All apps added to the Marketplace going forward will be set to "Yes" (mandatory).<br>  <br>- If ‘Yes’, an agency owner/admin can install your app to multiple subaccounts in one operation.<br>  <br>- Once set to 'Yes', this field cannot be reverted back to 'No'. |

## Distribution scenarios

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Developer’s distribution config scenarios | User Installation Scenarios | Getting the right access token |
| Who is the target user? | Who can install the app? | Can the app be bulk-installed by agencies? | Step 1: Identifying the type of installation from [Get Access Token API](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-access-token) | Step 2: |
| Agency | NA | NA | Agency user installs the app | “isBulkInstallation” : false,<br>“userType” : ”Company” | NA |
| Sub-account | Agency & sub-account | No | Sub-account user installs the app | “isBulkInstallation” : false,<br>“userType” : ”Location” | NA |
| Agency user installs the app | “isBulkInstallation” : false,<br>“userType" : "Location” | NA |
| Yes | Sub-account user installs the app | “isBulkInstallation” : false,<br>“userType" : "Location” | NA |
| \[NEW and RECOMMENDED\]<br>Agency user installs the app | “isBulkInstallation” : true,<br>“userType" : "Company” | 1. [Get sub-accounts where app is installed](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-installed-location)<br>2. [Get Location Token using Agency Token](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-location-access-token) for every location where app is installed<br>3\. Listen to [AppInstall webhook event](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/AppInstall) for automatic future installations or installs done as part of a SaaS plan, and [Get Location Token using Agency Token](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-location-access-token) for the newly installed locations. |
| Agency Only | Yes | Agency user installs the app | “isBulkInstallation” : true,<br>“userType" : "Company” |

* * *

## Backward compatibility

For all existing apps, to ensure the existing installation flow and token exchange mechanism is maintained, we have configured the fields as follows for the existing/legacy distribution types:

| Legacy Distribution Type | Developer’s distribution config mapping to ensure backward compatibility | Recommendation on how you can maximise the reach for your app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who is the target user? | Who can install the app? | Can the app be bulk-installed by agencies? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agency Only | Agency | NA | NA | NA |
| Sub-account Only | Sub-account | Agency & sub-account | No | 1\. Develop the token exchange mechanism for bulk-installation flow as mentioned above.<br>2\. Once done, set "Can the app be bulk-installed by agencies?" to "Yes" |
| Agency & Sub-account | Sub-account | Agency Only | Yes | To make the app accessible to sub-accounts, you must ensure the app does not require any agency-level access such as:<br>- Agency Level Scopes - companies.readonly, companies.write, location.write, saas/location.write, snapshots.readonly, snapshots.write, custom-menu-link.readonly, custom-menu-link.write<br>- Module > Snapshots<br>- Module > CustomJS<br>If your app does not require any of the above:<br>1\. Develop the OAuth flow for installation by sub-account admins, which would generate a **userType: Location** token, as mentioned above.<br>2\. Once done, change "Who can install the app?" **to** "**Agency & sub-account"** |

* * *

## **Target User: Agency**

Choose the Agency distribution type if your app's functionalities are applicable only to agency-level accounts.

**App Listing**: Apps will be listed solely in the agency level app marketplace.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048583594/original/f4TxfrBHaJTtETQV7pYDWWQ4nI5z7bz-vw.png?1750392601)

**Installation and Uninstallation**:  Only agency administrators or owners have the authority to install or uninstall the app at the agency account level.

**Payments**: For paid applications, the installing agency is responsible for the app's cost.

**Re-selling**: Agencies cannot re-sell these apps, as they are not available for installation at the sub-account level.

* * *

## **Target User: Sub-account - Both Can Install**

Select the Sub-account (both can install) type if your app's functionalities are intended for sub-account level accounts.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048583624/original/kJtU4fEgullilWG0fxoAnDDRM-hJdD-cdg.png?1750392750)

**App Listing**: These apps are available to both agency owners/admins and sub-account admins to install. These apps are listed in both Marketplaces.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048583635/original/eYRbavl9kxE3dTmJWUzJ26BuxrtACE9o4g.png?1750392836)

**Installation and Uninstallation**:  Both Sub-account admins and agency admins can install the app.

Sub-account admins can discover and install these apps to their respective sub-accounts.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155023404538/original/lQxf69LOM8uFEPOdE9MQ6M8gYq-b4GDkoA.png?1711222807)

**Bulk Installation**: If bulk-installation is supported by the app developer, agency admins can bulk-install such apps. If not, agency admins can install the app one sub-account at a time. Agencies can automatically install these apps for future sub-accounts if they choose the 'all sub-accounts' option during the initial installation.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155023404499/original/MqHiBlSiuQlJPZxBKZ49b7ZdsXzUeYZ6tw.png?1711222532)

**Payments**:  The sub-account installing a paid app will bear its cost.

**Re-selling**:  These apps can be re-sold by agencies.

* * *

## **Target User: Sub-account - Only Agency Can Install**

Opt for type Sub-account (only agency can install) distribution if your app is designed such a way that agency owners are the only relevant installers.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048584235/original/ifH_YbCWG2-uY5wxZFLw6jeWGAm3Ma0PpQ.png?1750394316)

**App Listing**: These apps will only show up in the agency view of the Marketplace.

**Installation and Uninstallation**: Installation and uninstallation of these apps at the sub-account level must be carried out by agency admins or owners only.

**Bulk Installation**: If enabled, Agency admins can bulk-install such apps. If not, agency admins can install the app one sub-account at a time. Agencies can automatically install these apps for future sub-accounts if they choose the 'all sub-accounts' option during the initial installation.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155023404499/original/MqHiBlSiuQlJPZxBKZ49b7ZdsXzUeYZ6tw.png?1711222532)

**Re-selling**: Agencies can re-sell these apps to their sub-accounts, with the agency paying the base price set by the developer and sub-accounts paying a marked-up price set by the agency.
