### **Question: Why is HighLevel charging me Sales & Use tax?**

**Answer: HighLevel has recently completed a Nexus Study. As a result, some of our products and services are considered taxable. This is a result of the [2018 ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494_j4el.pdf), a landmark Sales & Use tax nexus case which changed the rules on physical and economic nexus.**

### **Question: Which states are required to collect Sales & Use tax?**

**Answer: Here is a quick reference guide [https://www.salestaxinstitute.com/resources/rates](https://www.salestaxinstitute.com/resources/rates). Sales & Use tax varies between states, please consult your local tax advisor for more info.**

* * *

### **Question: My company is tax exempt or self-remits sales tax what should I do?**

**Answer: HighLevel requests that its customers complete a new sales tax exemption certificate(s) in order to continue selling to your company on a sales tax-exempt basis. Complete the Multistate Tax Commission’s - [Uniform Sales & Use Tax Exemption/Resale Certificate](https://www.mtc.gov/Resources/Uniform-Sales-Use-Tax-Exemption-Certificate) or another state-approved exemption certificate.**

**When completing the exemption certificate(s), please enter HighLevel, Inc as the Name of the Seller. Once you have submitted a valid exemption certificate you will not be required to do so again until the next expiration date.**
