## **What is the Code Element in Email Builder?**

The Code Element is a drag-and-drop block that enables you to add custom HTML or CSS directly into your email layout. It’s designed for advanced users who want to include specialised content such as embedded countdown timers, tracking tags, or layout modifications that aren’t possible through the standard visual editor.

When used correctly, it allows deeper customisation and helps you integrate third-party tools seamlessly within your email design.

> **Note:** Email clients have limited support for custom code. Always test your email before sending to ensure that all embedded content displays correctly across platforms.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Code Element**

Using the Code Element in your email design offers several advantages:

- Add custom HTML or CSS for unique layouts and designs.

- Embed third-party widgets such as timers, forms, or badges.

- Insert tracking pixels or analytics scripts for campaign insights.

- Fine-tune spacing, colors, and styles beyond standard editor capabilities.

- Experiment safely with advanced customization in specific sections of your email.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: **What types of code can I add using the Code Element?****

You can add HTML and inline CSS. JavaScript and iframe content are generally not supported by most email clients for security reasons.

**Q: Will my custom code affect the rest of the email layout?**

It can if not written correctly. Keep your code self-contained and use inline styles to prevent it from impacting other elements.

**Q: How can I make sure my code displays properly across email clients?**

Always test your email using the preview and send test options. Because email clients handle HTML differently, some code may look slightly different in each.

**Q: Can I save and reuse my custom code?**

Yes, once you’ve created a code block, you can duplicate or copy it across templates to reuse the same design or functionality.
