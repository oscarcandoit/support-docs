# **What is the Duplicate Contact Management & Merge Tool?**

HighLevel’s Duplicate Management & Merge Tool scans your entire Contacts list for identical or near-identical records, groups them, and lets you merge up to ten contacts into one “master” record without losing notes, tasks, tags, emails, or custom fields.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Duplicate Contact Management & Merge Tool**

- **Fast deduplication:** Eliminate redundant records in minutes—no CSV exports required.

- **Unified history:** Consolidate messages, notes, tags, and custom fields for a 360° contact view.

- **Better deliverability:** Prevent multiple sends to the same person to protect sender reputation.

- **Smarter automation & analytics:** Boost automation accuracy and reporting reliability.

- **Lower support burden:** Reduce headaches caused by fragmented or conflicting data.

* * *

## **Permissions & Restrictions**

| Role | Access |

### **Step 5:** Rejecting Duplicates

2. Confirm the rejection in the popup:





   - “This email address will not be used to find duplicates again.”

   - This action **cannot be reverted**.

```
Note: Rejected emails, phone numbers, or names will be excluded from future duplicate scans.
```

```
Note: Once merged, the process cannot be reverted. Review carefully before confirming.
```

1. Select up to **10 records** to merge at once.





   - The tool will notify you when the limit is reached (Limit reached 10/10).
2. Choose one record as the **Master** — this record will retain key details like name, main email, and main phone number.

3. All related data (tasks, opportunities, notes, products, etc.) from other records will be combined into this master record.

4. Click on **Merge**. Before merging, a confirmation dialog appears:





You’ll see:





   - A reminder that this action **cannot be undone**.

   - A note that **emails, phone numbers, notes, opportunities, and tasks** from all selected records will merge into one.

   - An option to confirm your understanding by checking the acknowledgment box.
5. Click **Merge Duplicates** to finalize.

## **Troubleshooting**

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “No duplicates found” | Limited scan criteria | Try switching to another criterion (Phone or Name). |
| “Limit reached (10/10)” | Too many records selected | Merge the first 10, then return to merge the next set. |
| “Merge button disabled” | Confirmation not checked | Check the “I understand this cannot be undone” box. |
| Missing merge option | Not an Admin role | Contact your Admin to request access. |

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What if my “Allow Duplicate Contacts” setting is ON?**

You can still create duplicates via forms or Zapier. The Manage Duplicates scan will find them later so you can merge manually.

**Q: Can I undo a merge?**

Merges are permanent. Always verify field selections in Smart Merge Preview before confirming.

**Q: Will conversations, opportunities, or appointments be lost?**

No, All related objects move to the Master record during the merge if you don't deselect during review.

**Q: How often should I run a scan?**

High-volume accounts typically scan weekly; others may prefer monthly or after bulk imports.
