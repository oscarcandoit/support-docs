# ClientPortal Builder Enhancement Pack

Modified on: Wed, 3 Sep, 2025 at 9:01 AM

HighLevel added multiple upgrades to the ClientPortal Builder to speed up branded app launches and reduce churn. Agencies can Book a Call for guided onboarding, end users now see a “Cancelled from Live” screen when subscriptions are paused or cancelled, and subscription automations are smoother with enhanced webhooks, automatic subscription creation, and re-subscription handling. These improvements reduce friction, improve retention, and shorten time-to-live.

# What is the ClientPortal Builder Enhancement Pack (Branded Apps)?

This set of enhancements improves how agencies launch and manage white-labeled branded apps. It introduces a guided onboarding option (Book a Call), a clear in-app status for paused/cancelled subscriptions (Cancelled from Live screen), and operational improvements (re-subscriptions, webhook integrations, and auto subscription creation) so teams can move from setup to live status faster and keep apps running reliably.

## Key Benefits of the Enhancement Pack

These advantages focus on faster go-live, clearer lifecycle messaging, and stronger automation so agencies and clients spend less time troubleshooting and more time engaging users.

- Faster go-live: Guided onboarding helps agencies complete store and branding steps quickly.

- Proactive churn management: A visible Cancelled from Live screen prompts timely renewal and reduces downtime.

- Automation-ready: Enhanced webhooks and auto subscription creation streamline reselling and provisioning.

- Retention support:Re-subscription handling makes it easier to bring churned apps back online.

- Operational clarity:Cancellation reasons are captured for coaching and process improvement.


## “Book a Call” (Agencies) — Guided Onboarding

This option connects agencies with HighLevel specialists to accelerate branded app setup—ideal for first-time launches or when internal capacity is tight.

What it does

- Lets agencies schedule a setup call directly from the ClientPortal Builder (exclusive to agency accounts).

- Targets adoption and time-to-live by walking you through required steps and best practices.

- Clarifies store requirements, assets, and submission timelines before work begins.


What to prepare

- App name, brand colors, logo and app icons (required sizes), splash screens.

- Apple App Store / Google Play developer account access.

- Legal, bundle IDs, and any required compliance details.

## “Cancelled from Live” Screen — Proactive Churn Management

When an app subscription is paused or cancelled, users see a clear in-app status page. This improves visibility, sets expectations, and nudges account owners to resume service quickly.

How it works

- Displays a status screen indicating the app is no longer live.

- Explains that action is required to restore access.

- Emphasizes customer impact, adding urgency to renew.


What users can do

- Follow the on-screen instructions to renew/resume the subscription.

- If needed, contact the agency or support using the link(s) provided.

## Re-subscription Handling for Churned Users

Recovering churned apps is easier. The flow supports restoring access, aligning billing, and getting the branded app back in customers’ hands quickly.

Key details

- Supports returning to an active state after a pause/cancel.

- Keeps subscription state, billing, and access aligned once payment succeeds.

- Minimizes manual steps for teams bringing apps back online.


## Webhook Automation & Reselling Improvements

Integrations are more powerful with enhanced reselling webhooks and the option to automatically create subscriptions via webhook, enabling hands-off provisioning.

What’s improved

- Enhanced reselling webhook integration with ClientPortal branded apps for cleaner partner workflows.

- Automatic subscription creation via webhooks so new customers get provisioned without manual setup.

- Better end-to-end lifecycle coverage for create → pause/cancel → resume.


Implementation tips

- Use secure, idempotent webhook endpoints.

- Log payloads and responses for auditing and support.

- Test create/resume/cancel flows in a staging environment before production.


## Capture Cancellation Reasons

Educational description:

Understanding why customers cancel supports better coaching, pricing, and product decisions—closing the loop on churn reduction.

How it works

- Users provide a cancellation reason within the branded app.

- Responses can be used for reporting, outreach, and process improvements.

- Combine qualitative feedback with subscription events to spot patterns.

## How To Set Up & Use These Features

Educational description:

The steps below outline how agencies access guided onboarding, manage lifecycle states, and enable automation to speed time-to-live and reduce churn.

A. Book a Call (Agencies)

1. Open ClientPortal Builder in your agency account.

2. Select your branded app project and click Book a Call.

3. Pick a date/time, confirm contact details, and submit.

4. Gather required assets (logos, icons, store access) before the call.

5. Join the call to finalize setup and next steps toward app submission.


B. Handle “Cancelled from Live” states

1. When the Cancelled from Live screen appears, review the message and the impact note.

2. Use the provided CTA to renew/resume the subscription.

3. After successful payment, relaunch the app and verify that the status screen is gone.

4. If you cancelled intentionally, capture the cancellation reason (if prompted) to inform future strategy.


C. Enable webhook-based automation (reselling/auto-create)

1. In your integration stack, configure webhook endpoints that can handle create, pause/cancel, and resume events.

2. Map payload fields to your billing/provisioning system and implement idempotency.

3. Test the automatic subscription creation flow end-to-end.

4. Monitor logs and metrics; add alerts for failures and retries.
