Now, agencies can effortlessly save time during onboarding and ensure consistent Document templates across multiple locations.

How It Works:

- Create a new snapshot and choose the source account.
- Save the snapshot.
- Load the snapshot into the desired sub-account
- Select all the Document Templates you want to load into the desired location
