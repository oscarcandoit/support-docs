## **About:**

Store owners now have a streamlined way to manage their inventory through the new Inventory Management page. This feature allows updates to product quantities and the option to "Continue selling when out of stock." It also includes enhanced search functionality.

## **How to use:**

1. Store owners can access the Inventory Management page at:
Payments > Products dropdown > Inventory.

2. On Inventory management page, store owners can update product quantities for any variant. If you want to allow
"Continue selling when out of stock"
toggle this option on.
3. After making inventory changes, ensure to click Save to apply them, or Cancel to discard them.
4. To find specific products, you can search by SKU or product/variant name.

## **Notes:**

- Changes must be saved or canceled before navigating away from the page; unsaved changes will block page navigation.
- If a SKU is not provided, it will display as "NO SKU."
- Clicking on a product variant will redirect to the variant detail page from the Inventory page.
