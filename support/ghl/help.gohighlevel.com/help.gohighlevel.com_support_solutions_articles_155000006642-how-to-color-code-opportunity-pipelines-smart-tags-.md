# How to Color-Code Opportunity Pipelines (Smart Tags)

Modified on: Mon, 10 Nov, 2025 at 8:02 AM

Smart Tags help you **visually prioritize opportunities** inside your pipelines using color-coded chips. Instead of relying on filters or text labels, you can highlight deals automatically based on rules you define — such as stale deals, high-value opportunities, or new leads.This article shows you how to create, edit and manages smart tags in HighLevel.

```
Note: This feature is currently in Labs and needs to be enabled by Agency for sub-accounts.

# **What is Smart Tags?**

Smart Tags are dynamic, rule-based color chips that appear directly on each Opportunity card inside a pipeline. Powered by an easy conditional builder, these tags evaluate every Opportunity in real time, then automatically apply a colored label whenever the record meets your criteria (e.g., deal value > $10 000 or “Last Contacted” > 14 days). The result is an at-a-glance, visual layer that eliminates the need for manual filters or tedious scanning.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Smart Tags**

- **Immediate prioritization:** High-impact deals jump off the screen.

- **Less context-switching:** No need to open each card or apply multiple filters.

- **Faster follow-ups:** “Stale” or “no owner” tags make gaps impossible to miss.

- **Consistent team focus:** Everyone sees the same color cues, driving aligned action.

- **Custom to every workflow:** Build any combo of AND/OR conditions across Standard or Custom Opportunity fields.

* * *

## **Permissions & Access**

- **Who can create or edit Smart Tags:**


  - Agency Admins

  - Location Admins

  - Users with Pipeline Edit Permissions
- **Who can view Smart Tags:**


  - All users (with Pipeline View Permission - even without editing permissions)

* * *

## **Limits & Validation**

- Each pipeline supports **up to 10** active Smart Tags.

- Duplicate tags in the same pipeline (same color + rule) are blocked automatically.

- Tags update automatically as deal data changes — no manual refresh required.

* * *

## **How to Setup & Use Smart Tags**

### **Step 1:** Find Smart Tags

1. Go to **Opportunities** from your sub-account.

2. Click on the **Pipelines** tab.

4. Open the **Smart Tags** tab.

### **Step 2:** Creating a Smart Tag

1. Click **Add Smart Tag.**



**![](https://jumpshare.com/share/xs6WW87OttyVfYr6Io9l+/Screen+Shot+2025-10-14+at+10.21.18+PM.png)**

2. Choose between:





   - **Create New Tag:** Define your own color, name, and rule conditions.

   - **Pre-Built Tag:** Use one of our default templates (e.g., _New Lead_, _High Value_, _At Risk_).



     ![](https://jumpshare.com/share/YTAhZp8CjAr7fQedHxkK+/Screen+Shot+2025-10-14+at+10.23.28+PM.png)
3. Enter a **Label Name** (e.g., “Stale Deal”).

4. Add a **Description** for clarity. (Optional)

5. Pick a **Color** for the tag.

6. Check **Apply to all pipelines** if you want this rule used globally.

7. Click **Next: Add Rule.**



**![](https://jumpshare.com/share/Y24qhRMvGpdtEt8pRgOr+/Screen+Shot+2025-10-14+at+10.28.48+PM.png)**


### **Step 3:** Defining Rules

1. Use the rule builder to specify **when the tag appears**.

2. Each tag is rule-based — for example:




   - **Created Date ≤ 3 days ago →** “New Lead”

   - **Last Activity Date ≥ 14 days ago →** “Stale Deal”

   - **Deal Value > $10,000 →** “High Value”
3. You can:




1. Combine multiple conditions with **AND / OR logic**

2. Add nested filters for complex logic

3. Use **Preview Tag** to see how it’ll appear on a sample card

4. When done, click **Save.**

* * *

## **Preview, Edit or Delete Tags**

- After the tag is created, users can easily **preview, edit or delete tags** directly from the smart tags page.

## **Recommended Pre-Built Tags**

| Tag Name | Color | Rule Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stale Deal** | Grey | Last Activity before 14 days ago | Highlight neglected opportunities |
| **High Value** | Green | Opportunity Value > $10,000 | Flag big-ticket deals |
| **New Lead** | Blue | Created Date ≤ 3 days ago | Track new opportunities |
| **At Risk** | Red | Last Stage Change > 30 days ago and Status = "Open" | Warn of deals going cold |
| **Hot Deal** | Orange | Created On < 7 Days and Opportunity Value > $5000 | Highlights recently created, high-ticket opportunities. |
| **Unassigned Deal** | Purple | Owner is empty | Spot opportunities without owners |

* * *

## **Best Practices**

✅ Use distinct colors for your top priorities (e.g., red for urgent, green for high-value).

✅ Keep tag names short — under 20 characters.

✅ Review rules regularly to ensure relevance.

* * *

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Smart Tags not visible on cards?**


  - Ensure Smart Tags are added to your card layout (via Customize Card).

  - Check that the rule conditions are correct and apply to the cards you’re viewing.

  - Do a hard refresh to sync the changes on the pipeline.

- **Missing the Smart Tags tab?**


  - Only Admins can access tag creation and editing.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do Smart Tags work across all pipelines?** Yes — if you select “Apply to all pipelines,” the tag will appear wherever its rule conditions are met.

**Q: Can I duplicate Smart Tags between pipelines?** Not yet, but you can reapply the same rule manually in another pipeline.

**Q: Are Smart Tags included in reports?** Currently, Smart Tags display visually in the pipeline view only.

**Q: Who can create or edit Smart Tags?**

Any user with permission to edit a pipeline’s settings can manage Smart Tags. Use Pipeline Permissions to restrict access if needed.

**Q: Are Smart Tags evaluated in real time?**

The system re-checks all tag rules whenever an Opportunity is created, updated, or when its stage/status changes.
