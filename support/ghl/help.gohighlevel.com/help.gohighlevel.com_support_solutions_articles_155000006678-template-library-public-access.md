# **What is Public Access to Template Library?**

Public Access to Template Library lets agencies generate an embeddable widget (iframe) that displays HighLevel’s template marketplace on any external site. Visitors can preview funnels, websites, emails, workflows and more, then click Continue to open the template inside HighLevel. Logged-in customers bypass the login screen, while new prospects are routed to your preferred sign-up or trial page. This makes the template experience 100 % self-serve, even before someone has a HighLevel account.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Template Library Public Access**

- **Capture** qualified leads **directly** from your marketing site

- Highlight real, **working examples** of HighLevel’s builder capabilities

- Establish **instant trust** by letting prospects “test-drive” designs

- Reduce sales friction—logged-in users open templates in **one click**

- **Flexible redirect** URL funnels non-users to free-trial, demo, or checkout pages

* * *

## **How Public Template Browsing Works**

Public visitors land on a page that contains your embed code. They can:

- **Search, filter, and preview** any template just as they would inside HighLevel.

- Click **Continue to use** a template.
  - If they are already **authenticated**, the chosen template **opens directly** in the correct HighLevel builder.

  - If they are not logged in, they’re sent to the **redirect URL you defined** (e.g., your HighLevel login, SaaS trial, or lead-capture form).

* * *

## **SEO & Analytics (Coming Soon)**

The product team is working on native SEO tags so public template pages can rank for “HighLevel funnel templates,” “email templates,” and similar keywords. In the meantime, you can:

- Add unique meta titles/descriptions to the page that hosts your embed.

- Track clicks and conversions with Google Tag Manager (container fires inside the hosting page).

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Does Public Access use my agency’s branding?**

A. Yes—the embed inherits your Agency Branding settings, including logo and colors.

**Q. Is this feature available on every plan tier?**

A. Public Access is included for all Agency plans; sub-accounts cannot generate embed codes.

**Q. Can I limit which templates appear publicly?**

A. Use Template Library’s Category & Tag settings to hide internal-only templates before you generate your embed. (help.gohighlevel.com)

**Q. Will SEO indexing hurt my gated templates?**

A. Only the embed container is indexed; the actual template preview URLs remain behind HighLevel authentication.

**Q. Can I collect UTM parameters from the embed?**

A. Yes—append UTMs to your redirect URL and they’ll persist through to the builder session.

**Q. How do I remove the library?**

A. Delete the iframe from your site or regenerate a new code with “Deactivate Embed” toggled off.
