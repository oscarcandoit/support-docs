# **What are Downgrade Settings for SaaS Clients?**

Downgrade Settings in HighLevel’s SaaS Configurator control whether sub‑account admins can move to a lower plan themselves. Agencies can turn this on/off, define the reasons clients select when downgrading, and optionally present a discount offer to keep the client on the current plan. The result is a self‑serve, transparent downgrade path with retention tools baked in.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Configuring Downgrade Settings for SaaS Clients**

- **Self‑Service Control:** Clients can initiate a downgrade from their Billing page without contacting support.

- **Churn Insight:** Captured downgrade reasons reveal patterns you can act on.

- **Revenue Protection:** Optional discount deflections can convince clients to stay on the current plan.

- **Operational Clarity:** Downgrades are scheduled for the next billing cycle with no proration surprises.

- **Auditability:** Detailed activity logs (and export) show who did what, when, and why.


* * *

## **Behavior & Billing Rules**

These rules define how billing and access change so you can set proper expectations with clients and your support team.

- **M** **onthly subscriptions:** the discount applies for the number of months you configure.

- **A** **nnual subscriptions:** the discount automatically applies for **1 year**.

- **Scheduled effective date:** Downgrades take effect **at the start of the next billing cycle**.

- **No proration:** No mid‑cycle refunds or partial charges.

- **Access until change:** Clients retain current‑plan features until the effective date.

- **Abort anytime:** Clients can **cancel a scheduled downgrade** and **Keep My Plan** before the effective date.

- **Upgrades remain available** at any time from Billing.

* * *

## **How to Set Up the Downgrade Flow**

#### **Step 1:** Enable Downgrades

- #### From the Agency Dashboard, go to **SaaS Configurator → Downgrade Settings**.

- Toggle **Allow clients (account admins) to downgrade their subscription** ON or OFF.

```
Note: If disabled, clients will not see any downgrade option in their billing settings.
```

#### **Step 2:** Manage Downgrade Reasons

- A default list of downgrade reasons is provided (e.g., “Too expensive,” “Not using features,” “Difficult to use”).

- Agencies can fully customize this list:





  - **Edit** existing reasons.

  - **Remove** reasons that don’t fit your business.

  - **Add new reasons** (up to 50 characters

```
Tip: Providing clear, relevant options helps you gather actionable insights into why customers are downgrading.
```

#### **Step 3:** Configure Discount Offers (Optional Deflections)

- Toggle **Enable Discount Offer** ON if you want to present clients with a discount when they attempt to downgrade.

- Enter details:





  - **Discount %** (e.g., 25%)

  - **Discount Duration** (e.g., 3 months for monthly plans)

  - Choose whether clients can use the discount more than once.
- Once all details are entered, click the blue **Save** button to apply the changes.

## **Customer Downgrade Flow**

When a client tries to downgrade, they will go through the following flow.

1. They go to **Account Settings → Billing → Modify Subscription → Downgrade**.

2. They must select a **downgrade reason** (from the list you configured).

3. If discount deflection is enabled, the discount offer is presented. If the client accepts, the downgrade is canceled and the discount is applied from the **next billing cycle.**

4. If they skip/decline all deflections, the downgrade is scheduled to begin from the **start of the next billing cycle**.

## **Track Activity Using Downgrade Logs**

Agencies can track all downgrade activity within the downgrade logs. Use these logs to identify churn risks and adjust your retention strategy.

1. Go to **SaaS Configurator → Cancellation Settings** then scroll down to **Activity Logs**.

2. The logs include:





   - Sub-account name

   - Timestamp

   - Outcome (Deflected / Downgraded)

   - Downgrade reason

   - From plan → To plan

   - Next billing date

   - User who initiated the downgrade
3. Use the **Download** option to export logs for deeper analysis.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: When does a downgrade take effect?**

At the start of the next billing cycle. There is no proration mid‑cycle.

**Q: Does accepting the discount cancel the downgrade?**

Yes. When a client accepts the discount, they stay on the current plan and the discount applies from the next billing cycle.

**Q: Can clients reverse a scheduled downgrade?**

Yes. From Billing → Modify subscription, choose Keep My Plan any time before the effective date.

**Q: What happens to features before the effective date?**

Clients retain current‑plan features until the scheduled effective date.

**Q: Why don’t my clients see a discount offer when downgrading?**

The Discount Offer may be disabled by your agency, or your clients are on V2 plans where the discount is not supported yet.
