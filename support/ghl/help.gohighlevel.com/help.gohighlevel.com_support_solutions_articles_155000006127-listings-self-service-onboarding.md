# **What Self Service Onboarding?**

Listings - Self Service Onboarding is an in‑app, step‑by‑step wizard inside the Listings dashboard that helps first‑time users finish essential **setup actions**. It appears for entities that still have incomplete requirements and remains visible until **all required steps** are completed for every incomplete entity in the sub‑account.

The goal of Self Service Onboarding is to ensure your business data is accurate and connected so Listings can publish consistently across supported directories. In Listings, an entity represents a business location or brand profile. Completing **onboarding** creates a reliable foundation for syncing to publishers and measuring performance.

```
Note: Listings Self Service Onboarding is available as part of the paid Listings feature. An active Listings subscription is required in the sub-account to access this onboarding experience
```

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Listings Self Service Onboarding**

- **Prominent dashboard placement:** Critical tasks stay visible on the Listings dashboard and in the entity view until you finish required steps.

- **Smart prioritization:** Entities with active subscriptions but incomplete forms are pushed to the top so you can focus on what matters first.

- **Progress tracking:** A simple status indicator (e.g., checkmarks/percent complete) shows how far you’ve gotten and what’s left.

- **Entity view integration:** Guidance appears inside each entity’s view when actions remain, so you can complete tasks in context.

- **Skip option:** You can temporarily skip a step and return later without losing overall progress.

- **Applicable only for incomplete entities**: Once all steps are completed for all entities, the onboarding widget disappears automatically.

## **Submit Entity Form**

Submitting the entity form creates the business record Listings uses to publish to directories. Accurate, complete details here prevent publisher rejections and reduce downstream corrections.

What you’ll provide (examples):

- Legal business name and display name

- Address, phone, website

- Primary category (and optional additional categories)

- Basic profile details (e.g., description

## **Add Business Hours**

Publishing accurate operating hours prevents customer frustration and improves trust across major directories. Listings syncs your hours to supported publishers after onboarding.

How to add hours:

1. Open the onboarding widget and choose **Add Business Hours**.

2. Enter regular hours (and optionally add special/holiday hours if available in your account).

3. Save your changes; you’ll see the status update in the widget.

## **Connect Google & Facebook**

Connecting your Google Business Profile (GBP) and Facebook Page enables Listings to sync key location data and improves the accuracy of your public profiles. These are the most visible publishers for most businesses.

Prerequisites:

- GBP Owner/Admin access for the location you’re connecting

- Facebook Page Admin access for the Page you’re connecting

- Browser pop‑ups enabled for the authentication flow


Steps:

1. From the widget, select **Connect Google** and complete the OAuth prompts with the correct Google account.

2. Select **Connect Facebook** and approve requested permissions for the intended Page.

3. Return to Listings and verify you see **Connected** status/badges for each publisher.

## **Add Services & Keywords**

Defining your services and relevant keywords improves search relevance across compatible publishers and helps customers understand what you offer.

How to add:

1. Open the widget and select **Add Business Services & Keywords**.

2. Enter your primary services and relevant keywords that describe your business.

How to add:

1. Choose **Add Social Media URLs** in the widget.

2. Paste the full URLs for your business’s official profiles.

3. Save. The widget updates to show completion.

## **Roles, Permissions & Prerequisites**

Ensuring the right access avoids failed connections and blocked steps. Confirm roles and permissions before starting.

- **Listings access:** Users must have permission to view and edit Listings in the sub‑account.

- **GBP:** Owner/Admin access for the Google Business Profile being connected.

- **Facebook:** Admin access for the Facebook Page being connected.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does the widget disappear when I finish one entity?**

No. The widget disappears only after all required steps are completed for all incomplete entities in the sub‑account.

**Q: Do I have to complete the steps in order?**

No. You can complete steps in any order. Use **Skip** to defer a step and return later without losing progress.

**Q: Do I need to connect both Google and Facebook?**

Connect the publishers prompted for your account. The step shows **Connected** for each successful link and **Action Required** for any pending connection.

**Q: What if I don’t have a GBP or Facebook Page yet?**

Create the profile first, ensure you have Admin/Owner access, then return to Listings to connect. See the integration guide linked above for prerequisites.

**Q: Will progress be saved if I leave and return later?**

Yes. Your progress is preserved, and the widget will reflect your current status when you come back.

**Q: Why did the widget reappear after completion?**

If a previously connected publisher loses authorization (e.g., token expires) or required data is removed, the affected step may reopen until fixed.
