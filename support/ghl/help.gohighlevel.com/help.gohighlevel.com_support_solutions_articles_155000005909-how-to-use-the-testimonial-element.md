# **What is the Testimonials Element?**

The Testimonial Element allows users to display customer feedback directly within funnel or website pages. It provides flexible layout styles, card formatting, and content customization. This helps businesses build trust and reinforce their brand by showcasing real experiences from happy clients.

Unlike the Review Widget, which automatically pulls reviews from third-party platforms like Google or Facebook, the Testimonial Element is designed for manually entered feedback. This gives users full control over the content, order, and appearance of each testimonial. The Testimonial Element is ideal for curated quotes, in-depth client stories, or brand-specific messaging.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Testimonials Element**

Highlight real client feedback in a polished and structured format that builds credibility at a glance.

- **Increase Social Proof:** Increases trust by showcasing real client outcomes

- **Save Time:** Prebuilt layouts and styles reduce design time

- **Stay On-Brand**: Reinforce brand identity by using custom fonts, colors, and styling

- **Keep It Clean and Clear**: Allow users to expand long testimonials with a simple “Read More” link

- **Enhance Readability and Impact**: Adjust font size, card shapes, and rating icons to make testimonials easy to scan

* * *

## **Customization Options**

Fine-tune how testimonials appear on your page using various styling, layout, and content display controls. The configuration panel is divided into three major areas: Testimonial Settings, Card Styles, and Layout Options.

### **Testimonial Settings**

Control what information is visible to ensure each testimonial emphasizes what matters most.

- **Show Profile Picture**: Toggle on/off to display customer images

- **Show Name, Caption, Date**: Display or hide details of the testimonial author

- **Show Logo**: Add branding to client reviews with logo display

- **Show Star Rating**: Toggle to turn on/off the visual 1–5 star rating

### **Layout Options**

Determine how testimonials are arranged on your page to best complement your content and draw attention to social proof.

Choose from three layout options:

- **Grid**: Uniform layout that aligns testimonials in a structured block

- **Vertical Masonry**: Staggered testimonial display based on content height

- **Carousel**: Interactive slider for rotating testimonials


You can also adjust the number of **C** **olumns**(0–4) and the **S** **pacing** between cards using sliders for added control.

### **Card Style Options**

Select from clean card templates and tailor typography and color options to align with your brand’s visual identity.

Choose from four layout options:

- **Default**: Content above with profile/image below

- **Reverse Center**: Image centered above text

- **Vertical Center**: Image centered below text

- **Horizontal**: Side-by-side profile and testimonial layout


You can also adjust additional styling factors including:

- Adjust corner radius for rounded card borders

- Modify font style and size for the content and author text

- Customize colors for background, card, name, caption, content, rating, date, and “Read More” links
