- [Notes:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005309-how-to-view-google-ad-campaign-statistics-in-ad-manager#notes:)

* * *

## **Step 1 \| Access the Statistics tab**

1. Navigate to **Ad Manager**.

2. Click on the **Statistics** tab at the top of the screen.

3. Select **Google** from the platform dropdown.

4. Choose a **date range** to filter the results.

* * *

## **Step 2 \| Understand the conversion summary panel**

The top section of the Statistics view includes a high-level **Conversion Summary** with the following metrics:

- **Impressions**: Total times your ads were displayed.

- **Clicks**: Number of user clicks.

- **Conversions**: Completed actions attributed to the campaign.

- **Average CPC**: Average cost-per-click.

- **Cost per Conversion**: Calculated cost to acquire one conversion.

- **CPM**: Cost per thousand impressions.

- **Client Spends**: Total ad spend by the account.

* * *

## **Step 3 \| Performance Analytics**

Just below the summary, you will find **Performance Analytics** in a visual graph format:

- **Impressions graph** shows how visibility trends over time.

- **Clicks graph** reveals engagement volume.

- **Conversions graph** helps track conversion trends.


You can use these visuals to understand campaign behaviour and spot anomalies or opportunities.

* * *

## **Step 4 \| Dive Into Campaign-level metrics**

Scroll to the **Campaign Details** table to analyse all your campaigns:

- **Clicks, CTR, CPC, Impressions**

- **Sales, Revenue, ROI%, Leads**

- **Cost per Lead (CPL), Cost per Sale (CPS)**


Use the **search bar** to look up a specific campaign and **export** or **customise columns** as needed.

* * *

## **Step 5 \| View detailed Statistics for an Individual Campaign**

1. From the campaign list, click on a **campaign name**.

2. This opens the campaign dashboard with deeper insights at three sub-levels:

   - **Ad Group Performance**: View metrics like clicks, impressions, conversions for each group.

   - **Ad Performance**: Understand how each creative performs within ad groups.

   - **Keyword Performance**: Discover which keywords are driving results or underperforming.

This granularity helps you:

- Pause low-performing ad groups or keywords.

- Adjust budgets to high-performing segments.

- Optimize creatives that show strong engagement.


* * *

## **Notes:**

- Data refreshes periodically. Allow some time after publishing before metrics populate.
- Zero conversions may indicate issues with tracking setup or landing page performance.
- Use consistent date ranges for accurate comparisons.
