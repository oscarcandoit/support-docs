# **What is Taxes and Processing Fees for Services (v2)?**

Taxes and processing fees in **Services (v2)** let you present a clean, itemized checkout to customers while keeping internal reporting accurate. Each Service automatically creates a **linked Product**. You attach **manual tax rate(s)** to that Product, and optionally add a **processing/miscellaneous fee** to the Service so both appear automatically when the Service is booked.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Taxes and Processing Fees**

These benefits focus on transparency, compliance, and consistency across payments. Use them to reduce billing disputes and simplify reconciliation.

- **Cost recovery:** pass through card/convenience costs with a labeled fee.

- **Compliance:** meet local rules using accurate manual sales/VAT/GST rates.

- **Consistency:** align totals across booking pages, appointment records, receipts, and exports.

- **Trust:** show an **itemized** total before payment to reduce confusion and chargebacks.


* * *

## **Processing Fees / Miscellaneous Charges**

A **Miscellaneous Charge** (processing fee) is an extra percentage-based line you add per **Service (v2)** to cover processing or convenience costs. The label and percentage are fully customizable and display as a separate line at checkout and on receipts.

**What it does**

- Percentage-based fee (e.g., **5%**) with a custom label (e.g., **“Service Charge”**).

- Displays as its own line on the **public booking form** and on **payment receipts**.

- Appears in the **appointment record** so staff can see the subtotal, fee, tax, and total.

* * *

## **Manual Taxes in Services (v2)**

Manual taxes are attached to a **Product**, not directly to the Service. Because each Service has a **linked Product**, assigning tax rate(s) to that Product ensures the correct taxes are added to the booking total every time the Service is purchased.

**How it works**

- Each Service (v2) **auto-creates** a linked Product.

- Add one or more **tax rate(s)** to that Product in **Payments → Settings → Taxes**.

- When the Service is booked, those tax rate(s) are applied automatically.


* * *

## **Visibility in Bookings & Receipts**

Knowing where fees and taxes appear helps teams verify totals and answer customer questions. The same totals carry into the appointment record for internal clarity and reporting.

You’ll see taxes and fees:

- On the **public booking form** (itemized just above the total).

- Inside the **appointment modal** for staff, including payment details.

- On **sales receipts** emailed to the customer (when receipts are enabled).

## **How To Set Up Taxes & Processing Fees**

Proper setup ensures every booking reflects accurate totals, reduces customer confusion, and speeds up reconciliation. Follow these steps to configure both taxes and fees.

1. **In your Sub-Account, Click on Settings → Calendars → Services** → select the Service to edit.

2. **Payments** section → click **Configure Taxes for This Service**.

3. In the **linked Product** window, choose **Add Tax Rate** or select an existing rate → **Save**.

**(Optional) Add a Processing/Miscellaneous Fee** on the Service → enter a **percentage** and a **custom label**.

4. **Save** the Service. Future bookings will itemize the **fee** and **tax** lines automatically on the booking page, appointment record, and receipt.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use different fees for different Services?**

Yes. Fees are configured **per Service** in Services (v2), so each Service can have its own percentage and label.

**Q: Do tax or fee changes affect past bookings?**

No. Edits affect **new** bookings going forward; previously completed bookings and receipts remain unchanged.

**Q: Where can I export a report of collected fees and taxes?**

Go to **Payments → Transactions → Export CSV** (and **Orders CSV** if used). Exports include columns for fee amounts/labels and taxes to support reconciliation.

**Q: How do discounts and deposits affect the total?**

Discounts reduce the taxable base on the **linked Product** and may affect the fee if the fee is calculated as a percentage of the service price. For deposits, the appointment modal and receipts show what was collected vs. remaining.
