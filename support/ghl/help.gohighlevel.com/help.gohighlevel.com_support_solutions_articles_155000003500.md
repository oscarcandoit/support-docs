# Editing a countdown timer

Modified on: Thu, 19 Sep, 2024 at 6:14 AM

Editing a countdown timer is essential when you want to update its appearance, change its timing details, modify linked actions, or adjust its name. Here's a step-by-step guide on when and how to edit a countdown timer.

### **When Can You Edit a Countdown Timer?**

You can make changes to the countdown timer **only before** it has been used in an email campaign. Once the countdown timer has been included in an email that has been sent out, the only option left is to **archive** the timer. So, ensure all changes are made **before** sending any email that includes the timer.

### **What Can You Edit?**

1. **Style Changes:**

   - You can change the appearance of the timer by adjusting the font, colors, and overall design to match your branding.
2. **Timer Details:**

   - This includes modifying the time remaining, the end date, or any other time-related details to align with your campaign goals.
3. **Dynamic Link Changes:**

   - You can update the dynamic link associated with the timer, which may redirect users to a different landing page or resource once the timer ends.
4. **Naming:**

   - Adjust the name of the timer to keep things organized or to better reflect the purpose of the countdown.

### **How to Edit a Countdown Timer**

1. **Go to Marketing Section:**

   - Navigate to the **Marketing** section of your dashboard.
2. **Access the Countdown Timer:**

   - Look for the **Countdown Timer** option, where all your existing timers are listed.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033082995/original/yyuLvH0utaVovEwv4Nd02ptx_1jf16SNfA.png?1726657344)
3. **Find and Select Your Timer:**

   - Search for the specific timer you want to edit. Once found, click on the **Edit** button.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033082957/original/sOzPM68Akya8CH8xK0YJV2_LNr8HFaGSMw.png?1726657317)
4. **Edit the Parameters:**

   - You can now modify anything,  like:
     - Style (fonts, colors)
     - Timer details (start/end time)
     - Dynamic links - Active or Expired
     - Timer name![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033083008/original/kScOPjJWTUlCe7NI65irqjymnMeXsiQG9w.png?1726657362)
5. **Save Your Changes:**

   - Once you're done making the adjustments, be sure to click on **Save Changes** to apply them.
