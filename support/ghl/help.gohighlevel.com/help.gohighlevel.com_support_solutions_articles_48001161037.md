# **What is a Group Calendar in HighLevel?**

A **Group Calendar** in HighLevel is a container that **groups multiple individual calendars under one link**. This allows for flexible booking experiences such as selecting from multiple service providers, distributing appointments and offering service-based choices tied to specific team members.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Group Calendars**

Group Calendars help you streamline your appointment booking workflows by:

- **Combining multiple calendars** into a single booking link.

- Allowing clients to **choose between team members or services**.

- **Organizing calendar links** by department, availability, or services.

- **Reducing clutter** by replacing multiple individual calendar links.

* * *

## **How to Create a Group Calendar**

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Calendar Settings

1. Go to your **sub-account Settings.**

### **Step 3:** Adding Calendars to the Group

After creating the Group Calendar, a popup box will appear with two options:

1. **Choose Calendars:** Allows the user to select calendars for the group directly from the pop-up.

2. **I'll Do It Later:** User can skip and add the calendars to the group later.

4. Click on **Confirm**.

```
Note: If no calendars appear, ensure you’ve created individual calendars beforehand.
```

* * *

## **Syncing with External Calendars**

Ensure each team member has a **Primary Calendar** configured in their calendar settings. This is necessary for syncing appointments to their **third party** calendars like Google and Outlook.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I create a calendar directly from the Group Calendar setup screen?**

No. You must first create individual calendars under the Calendars tab. Once those are created, you can assign them to a Group Calendar. Group Calendars are containers — they don’t create or configure individual calendars on their own.

**Q: Can I group Class or Collective calendars?**

No. Group Calendars are separate from Class and Collective calendar types. Each has its own structure and behavior. You can use separate booking flows for those calendar types based on your use case.

**Q: What happens if I delete a calendar inside a group?**

The group calendar will still exist, but the deleted calendar will no longer appear as a booking option. Always verify group composition after editing or deleting calendars.

**Q: How to share or embed a Group calendar?**

Check the HighLevel calendar [embedding guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982201).

**Q: Can I Show Multiple Calendars Without Using a Calendar Group?**

Yes, for more information checkout our guide [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001049320).
