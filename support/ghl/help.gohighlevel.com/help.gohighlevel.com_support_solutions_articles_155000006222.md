Modified on: Fri, 29 Aug, 2025 at 4:40 PM

The Enable/Disable Deprecated Features settings lets you control access to legacy modules so teams adopt modern replacements.

# **What are Depreciated Features?**

Depreciated features are features in HighLevel that are no longer updated or supported by the engineering team and that are not offered to sub-accounts by default. Currently Campaigns and Triggers and the only depreciated features in this list. They are depreciated because workflows have completely replaced them as a significantly superior option ( [Click Here to learn more about Workflows and Automations](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002288)).

You can turn Depreciate Features on for your customers using the checkboxes, but be aware that you may run into issues or bugs with these features that may never get resolved by our team. Depreciated features are like that for a reason. They are getting "phased out" of the application.
