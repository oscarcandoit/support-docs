# Important Notes

1. **Permissions Required:** Only users with **Account Admin** or **Agency** Roles with **FULL** access to a Dashboard can set default dashboards. To learn more about Dashboard Permissions, [click here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001532-how-to-manage-permissions-for-a-dashboard)!
2. **Viewing Permissions:** All team members must have at least **VIEW** permission for the dashboard to be set as default.
3. **Non-Deletable Default Dashboards:** Once set as default, a dashboard cannot be deleted until another default dashboard is assigned.
4. **Distinguishing Default and Pinned Dashboards:** Default dashboards serve as the primary landing page for all users, while pinned dashboards are personal favorites that individual users can access quickly.
