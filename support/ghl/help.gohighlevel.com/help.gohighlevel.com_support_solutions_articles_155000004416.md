# **What is Conversation AI Bot Training?**

Bot training is the process of teaching your AI bot to provide accurate and context-specific responses to customer queries. Using tools like the Web Crawler and Custom Bot Responses, you can build a comprehensive knowledge base that supports seamless customer interactions. Whether your customers ask general or specific questions, a well-trained bot ensures their needs are met efficiently.

## **Key Benefits of Training Your Bot**

- **Improved Accuracy**: With access to relevant data sources, your bot can deliver precise responses tailored to customer questions.

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Automated responses reduce manual intervention, saving time for your team and customers.

- **Consistency**: Ensure customers receive the same high-quality information across all interactions.

- **Scalability**: Support a growing customer base without increasing resources.


* * *

## **Web Crawler**

The Web Crawler allows you to train your bot using information available across the internet, ensuring it can deliver accurate, context-specific responses. You can configure the Web Crawler to include data from exact URLs, paths, or entire domains, as well as Google Docs.

_![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155039825074/original/6LJg1GHQ3QSp6KEgbacL0CwQEcIRXnHGMg.jpeg?1736872923)_

### **How to Add URLs to Web Crawler**

Providing the bot with URLs is a critical step in creating a robust knowledge base. By adding URLs, you allow the Web Crawler to extract and utilize specific information from websites, ensuring the bot has access to accurate and contextually relevant data for customer interactions.

```
HighLevel Pro Tips: Here are some HighLevel Pro Tips and Best Practices to help you get the most out of training your bot with the Web Crawler!

Ensure that the URLs and documents are up-to-date and relevant.

Focus on commonly asked questions and high-priority topics.

Structure the content clearly for easier parsing.
```

### **Step 1:** Choose Domain Type and Enter Domain

There are multiple domain types that you can crawl when training your bot. The domain type that you choose will dictate how many URLs will be crawled to train your bot.

- **Exact URLs**: Crawls a specific webpage to use its data for training. For example, entering `https://www.gohighlevel.com/` limits the crawl to that exact webpage.


- **All URLs with Path**: Crawls all pages within a specific path. For example, entering `https://www.gohighlevel.com/marketing` includes all pages using that URL path, such as `/marketing/offers` or `/marketing/promotions``.`


- **All URLs in Domain**: Crawls all pages within a domain. For example, entering `https://www.gohighlevel.com/promo` includes all pages with the root domain `www.gohighlevel.com`.

### **Step 2:** Crawl URL

Once you select your URL type and enter your URL, click the "Get Data" button to begin crawling the URL or URLs. This process may take some time depending on how many URLs you are crawling for information.

### **Step 3:** Select Crawled URLs

All the crawled URLs will appear in a list, giving you the ability to select any number of the URLs to use as training data for your bot. You can **"select all" URLs**, or **select individual URLs** by clicking the checkbox next to the URL you want to add into your training data.

### **Using Google Docs to Train Bots**

Provide the bot with a Google Doc URL to use its content for training. This is ideal for uploading detailed documentation, FAQs, or service descriptions.

#### **Requirement for Using Google Docs for Training**

In order to use Google Docs to train your Conversation AI bot, you need to make the Google Doc **"Public"**. To do this, you need to set the Google Doc share setting to **"anyone with link"**.

1. Open your Google Doc

2. Click the **"Share"** button in the top right corner of your screen

3. Under **"General Access"**, select the option that reads **"Anyone with the Link"**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155039829734/original/3VKjAUTThq0ur38LW5KrCBwmTKRW4cD1Sw.gif?1736879557)

```
IMPORTANT: If you DO NOT change the share settings on your Google Doc, you will see an error message like the one shown in the screenshot below.
```

## **Custom Bot Responses (FAQs)**

Custom Bot Responses allow you to define precise answers for frequently asked questions. These responses ensure that the bot delivers consistent and accurate information, especially for critical customer queries.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155039825087/original/qUzTiAVc684gNegMV0Xa2FbhmjXC8HqZxw.jpeg?1736872947)

```
HighLevel Pro Tips: Here are some HighLevel Pro Tips and Best Practices to help you get the most out of training your bot with Custom Bot Responses!

Keep answers concise and to the point.

Anticipate variations of commonly asked questions.

Regularly update responses to match changing customer needs.
```

### **How to Add Custom Bot Responses**

Custom Bot Responses are essential for ensuring your bot delivers precise answers to frequently asked questions. By defining exact responses to common queries, you can improve the bot's consistency, accuracy, and ability to address critical customer needs effectively.

There are two ways you can add new Custom Bot Responses to your training data, manually adding the FAQs or providing feedback on bot responses in conversations:

**Adding FAQs Manually**:

- Click the **"\+ Add Q&A"** button

- Enter the question and define the exact response.

- Save the response for future use.

**AI Conversation Feedback**:

- Provide feedback during live conversations or from within your AI test environment by using **THUMBS-UP** or **THUMBS-DOWN** options under bot-generated responses.

- This feedback refines the bot’s future replies.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How often should I update my bot’s training data?**

Updating training data quarterly or after major changes to your services ensures accuracy and relevance.

**Q: Can I use multiple URLs for training the bot?**

Yes! Combining Exact URLs, Path-specific URLs, and Domain-level URLs helps build a comprehensive knowledge base.

**Q: How do I ensure my bot’s responses are accurate?**

Use the feedback mechanism and test your bot frequently by simulating customer queries. Regularly updating FAQs also ensures accuracy.

**Q: What happens if my bot cannot answer a question?**

Depending on its settings, the bot can ask for clarification or escalate the query to a human agent.

**Q: What types of information work best for Custom Bot Responses?**

Include precise and critical information, such as pricing, policies, or instructions, to address common customer needs effectively.
