### **Community group member leaderboard Level Changed (Trigger)**

- **Trigger**: This activates when a user’s leaderboard level changes.
- **Filters**: You need to set filters to specify which groups and levels the trigger applies to.
- **Use Case**: Automatically send congratulatory emails or award points when a user reaches a new level.

**How to use:**

- Navigate to the Workflow Setup Page.
- Choose the Trigger:Select "User Group Gamification Level Changed" from the list of available triggers.
- Configure Filters: Use filters to specify conditions, such as a particular group or level. This ensures the trigger activates only when these conditions are met. **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035497574/original/C9pi23EJRV3yn534k69lkToj7u0e5msCRg.png?1730046272)**

### **Grant community group leaderboard points - Action**

**1\. Gamification Points Allocation**

- **Action:** Ability to grant leaderboard points for any specific triggers.
- **Points to be Given:** Configurable via a dropdown in the workflow setup. You can specify the number of points and the group to which they apply.
- **Use Case:** Encourage user engagement by awarding points for completing desired actions, helping them climb the leaderboard.

**2\. How to use:**

1. Select the "Grant community group leaderboard points" Action:
   - Choose this action to award points to users who complete specific actions within the group.
2. Configure Points and Group:
   - Points: Set the number of points to be awarded.
   - Group: Use the dropdown to select which group this applies to. This ensures only users from the chosen group are awarded points.
3. **Note: If member is not part of group, the workflow execution will fail**
