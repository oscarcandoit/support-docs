A Group Calendar ID in HighLevel is a **unique identifier assigned to each group calendar you create**. It’s used in **integrations, workflows, and API calls** to reference that specific calendar.

- **Triggering workflows** based on calendar bookings.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use the same Calendar ID in multiple workflows?**

Yes! As long as the workflows are connected to the same Group Calendar, the Calendar ID can be reused in different workflows and integrations.

**Q: Are Calendar IDs the same for all users in the sub-account?** Yes. The Calendar ID is tied to the calendar itself and remains the same regardless of the user accessing it, as long as they have permission.

**Q: Will the Calendar ID change if I rename the calendar?**

No, renaming the calendar will not affect the Calendar ID. The ID remains constant regardless of the calendar’s display name.

**Q: What if the Calendar ID format changes?** HighLevel will notify users of any changes to calendar structures or URL formats. Bookmark this article to stay updated.

**Q: What if I deleted a calendar? Will the ID still work?**

No, once a calendar is deleted, its ID becomes invalid. Any references to that ID in workflows or integrations will stop functioning.

**Q: Can I use Calendar IDs to filter bookings in the API?** Yes, if you're pulling data from the API, you can use the Calendar ID to filter bookings or appointment data for a specific calendar.
