# **What is Linking Opportunities with Invoices and Estimates?**

Linking invoices and estimates to opportunities allows you to centralize sales and billing data. Whether you’re creating invoices manually or sending them via automation, each document stays connected to the relevant deal.

## **Key Benefits of Linking Opportunities with Invoices and Estimates**

Connecting billing documents directly to deals ensures nothing gets lost in the sales pipeline.

- Automatically associate every invoice or estimate with the relevant opportunity.

- Get a complete financial history for each deal.

- Reduce manual entry and potential for errors.

- Enable seamless automation using workflows.

- View billing details directly from the Opportunity record.

- Keep your team aligned with centralized deal and payment visibility.


## **How to Link Invoices and Estimates from an Opportunity**

Quickly link an invoice or estimate while managing an individual deal in the CRM.

1. Navigate to **Opportunities** and open a deal.

2. Click the **Payments** tab.

3. From the **Actions menu**, choose **Create Invoice** or **Create Estimate**.

4. You’ll be redirected to the invoice/estimate editor with the Opportunity already linked.

5. Complete the form and send when ready.


## **How to Link via the Payments Tab**

Use the main Payments area to manually associate invoices and estimates with deals.

1. Go to the **Payments** tab in your main menu.

2. Switch to **Invoices** or **Estimates** using the dropdown.

3. Click **Create Invoice** or **Create Estimate**.

4. Select a **Contact**.

5. In the document editor, choose the relevant **Opportunity** under “Link Opportunity.”


## **How to Automatically Link via Workflows**

Automate the entire process so your invoices and estimates are generated and linked without manual effort.

1. Go to **Workflows** and create a new one or open an existing one.

2. Use an **Opportunity-based trigger** (e.g., stage change or status update).

3. Add a **Send Invoice** or **Send Estimate** action.

4. The system will create, send, and automatically link the document to the opportunity.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I link multiple invoices or estimates to one opportunity?**

Yes, you can link multiple billing documents to a single opportunity to reflect multiple stages of payment or proposals.

**Q: What happens if I forget to link an invoice?**

You can manually edit the invoice later and link it to the correct opportunity from the Payments tab.

**Q: Can I unlink an invoice or estimate from an opportunity?**

Currently, unlinking is not supported after the document is finalized. Consider cloning and reassigning it if needed.

**Q: Do workflow-linked invoices appear in the Opportunity view?**

Yes, any invoice or estimate generated through a workflow and tied to an opportunity will be visible in that Opportunity’s Payments tab.

### **Next Steps**

- Explore the **Workflow Builder** to automate more sales actions.

- Customize your **Opportunity stages** to align with your billing steps.

- Use the **Reporting** feature to monitor revenue by deal.
