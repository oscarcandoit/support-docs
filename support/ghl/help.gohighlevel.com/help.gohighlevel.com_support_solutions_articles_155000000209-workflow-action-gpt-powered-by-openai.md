**3\. Temperature (Advanced options):** Sampling temperature refers to the parameter used in generating AI text with varying levels of randomness. It is set between the range of 0.1 and 1. Higher values, such as 0.8, result in more diverse and random output. In contrast, lower values, like 0.2, produce more focused and predictable responses. Adjusting the sampling temperature allows users to customize the level of creativity and control in the AI-generated content.

**Q. Are there any limitations or considerations when using the GPT Action?**

While the GPT action offers powerful capabilities, it's important to note that it relies on the underlying ChatGPT model. The responses generated by the AI may not always be perfect, and it's recommended to review and validate the output before sending it to customers. Additionally, extensive testing and monitoring are crucial to ensure the quality and accuracy of the generated responses.
