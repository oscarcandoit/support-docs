# **What are Active Transactions?**

**Transactions** are records where you are currently selling something to a customer. The parties, items and amounts have been recorded in a "transaction". An **Active** Transaction is simply a Transaction that has been started but hasn't been finished yet.

**Active Transactions** is a feature in the mobile app POS that **consolidates all your due and overdue** invoices, estimates, and appointment payments in one place. This helps you avoid missed payments and makes it simple to collect what you're owed — quickly and on the go. You don't have to hunt through all Transactions to find the ones that still need payment.

* * *

## **Manage Active Transactions**

How to use the Active Transactions feature in your mobile app:

1. **Login** to the HighLevel mobile app (or LeadConnector/whitelabel app) using your subaccount credentials.

2. **Tap on the POS icon** from the bottom navigation bar.

3. **Open the Active Transactions menu** (located in the POS bottom bar).

4. You’ll see all your due and overdue invoices, including:




   - Estimates

   - Documents & contracts

   - Appointment invoices
