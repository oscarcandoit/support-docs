## **Introduction**

**Round Robin Calendars** automate the distribution of appointments among a team of users. This feature ensures fair scheduling while optimizing availability, making it ideal for businesses that rely on team-based bookings, such as sales, customer support, and medical services.

With the **Round Robin Calendar** Type, you can provide customers with more available time slots while efficiently handling your team's workload. It automatically assigns new meetings to team members, eliminating the need for manual assignments and saving you time.

## **Appointment Distribution Methods**

Round Robin Calendars use 2 primary distribution methods: **Optimize for Availability** and **Optimize for Equal Distribution**. Choosing the right method depends on your business goals.

### **1\. Optimize for Availability**

This method prioritizes appointments based on the availability of team members. If a team member is available at the chosen appointment time, they will be assigned the booking.

- **Best for:** Businesses prioritizing immediate availability (e.g., customer support, urgent medical services).

- **Key Features:**

  - Assigns appointments to available team members first.

  - Ensures efficient use of available slots.

  - Reduces wait times for customers.

```
Important Note: The appointment distribution logic (for both methods) is calculated once every 24 hours. If you’re using “Equal Distribution,” the system won’t recalculate or rotate assignments in real time after every booking.
```

### **2\. Optimize for Equal Distribution**

This method ensures that appointments are evenly distributed across team members, regardless of immediate availability. It rotates assignments to maintain fairness.

- **Best for:** Sales teams, consultation services, or businesses that want equal workload distribution.

- **Key Features:**

  - Ensures no single team member gets too many appointments.

  - Maintains fairness across the team.

  - Works best when all team members have similar work hours.

## **Setting Team Member Priorities**

You can assign priority levels to team members to influence appointment distribution. Higher-priority members will receive bookings first if multiple team members are available.

If multiple team members are available simultaneously, priority settings can be applied to determine the assignment order.

The available priority levels are:

| **Priority Level** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **High Priority** | The team member will be selected first if available. |
| **Medium Priority** | The team member will be selected if no high-priority member is available. |
| **Low Priority** | The team member will be selected only if no high or medium-priority members are available. |

## **Selecting Meeting Location**

When setting up appointments, you can define a preferred meeting location for each team member. This allows flexibility in how and where meetings take place.

| **Meeting Location Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Zoom** | Select this option if the meeting will be conducted via Zoom. |
| **Google Meet** | Use this option to schedule Google Meet appointments. |
| **Phone** | Select if the meeting will be conducted over a phone call. |
| **Full Address** | Useful for in-person meetings requiring a physical location. |
| **Ask the Booker** | Allows the person booking to specify a meeting location. |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Choose this if the meeting will take place via Microsoft Teams. |
