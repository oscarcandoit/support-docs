# **What is Manual Call Action?**

Manual Call Action is a type of Manual Action used in HighLevel workflows. It allows you to assign outbound call tasks to a team member based on workflow triggers such as tags, form submissions, or appointments. Once the workflow is triggered, the contact appears under the Manual Actions tab in the Conversations section.

## **Key Benefits of Manual Call Action**

- **Automation Flexibility**: assign call tasks automatically from workflows.

- **Workflow Efficiency**: enable reps to manage outbound call queues from one tab.

- **Task Tracking**: check statuses like _Yet to Call_ or _Completed_ for clear follow-up.

- **Custom Triggers**: trigger based on contact tags, form fills, pipeline stage changes, and more.
