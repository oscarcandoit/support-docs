# **What is Live Streaming & Video Calling?**

Media Core Live Streaming & Video Calling is HighLevel’s end-to-end solution for real-time video. It adds Interactive Video Rooms for multi-participant collaboration and a Live Streaming Engine for one-to-many broadcasts—on the same infrastructure that already stores your on‑demand images and videos.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Live Streaming & Video Calling**

These benefits focus on enabling efficient, high‑quality live video while reducing tool sprawl, simplifying setup, and giving you control over performance, costs, and brand presentation.

- **One unified platform**: Store assets, run video calls, and live stream from a single media hub inside HighLevel.

- **Zero external licenses**: Eliminate separate Zoom/StreamYard/OBS hosting fees by using native experiences.

- **Built for engagement**: Raise hands, share reactions, chat in real time, and switch layouts to spotlight speakers.

- **Recording & replay**: Turn every call or stream into on‑demand content for members who couldn’t attend live.

- **Resource protection**: Automatic session shutdown prevents runaway costs when connection‑minute thresholds are exceeded.

- **Integrated analytics**: Track connection minutes, bandwidth usage, participant counts, and join/leave times.

- **Simple developer experience**: Drop in Vue components—state, connections, and real‑time events are handled for you.

* * *

## **Interactive Video Rooms**

Use Interactive Video Rooms for collaborative work—client meetings, coaching, classrooms, and team huddles. Controls help hosts moderate access, maintain order, and keep engagement high without juggling multiple tools.

- **Preview Mode**: Let attendees test camera and mic before joining for smoother starts.

- **Dynamic Layouts**: Automatically switch between **Grid View** (everyone visible) and **Speaker View** (active speaker spotlight).

- **Granular Host Controls**: Mute/unmute participants; grant or revoke **mic**, **video**, or **screen share** access; **remove** attendees if needed.

- **Participant Limits**: Configure the maximum number of participants per session.

- **Raise Hand**: Attendees can request to speak without interrupting.

- **Emoji Reactions**: Floating reactions boost energy without breaking flow.

- **Recording & Replay**: Record the call and optionally share a replay link for those who missed it.

* * *

## **Live Streaming Engine**

Use the Live Streaming Engine for one‑to‑many broadcasts—webinars, launches, town halls, and live announcements. Choose your production style—from quick webcam sessions to external encoder setups—while keeping the experience native to HighLevel.

- **Stream Software Mode**: Generate a **Stream Key & URL** (RTMP) and broadcast from tools like OBS, Zoom, or StreamYard.

- **WebCam Mode**: Go live directly in your browser—no external software required.

- **Professional Ingest**: Bring your studio or encoder feed directly into HighLevel for a polished broadcast.

- **Role‑Based Access**: Separate **Host** (broadcaster) and **Attendee** (viewer) roles for security and clarity.

- **Live Interaction**: Viewers can watch, **chat**, and **react** in real time—with a **live participant count** visible to hosts.

- **Recording**: Capture broadcasts to create on‑demand videos from your live event.

* * *

## **Build Your Own Experience (Composable Components)**

Media Core’s component‑based architecture gives you granular building blocks—so you can match your brand, rearrange UI, and create specialized layouts for collaboration or broadcasting.

- **Composable by design**: Use "<Player>, <ControlBar>, <Chat>" and other granular pieces to craft any layout.

- **Fully customizable**: Style and arrange components for minimalist tiles or complex multi‑column stages.

- **DX advantage**: Connection logic, state management, and real‑time events are handled for you.

* * *

## **Integrated Analytics & Resource Protection**

Built‑in analytics help you understand engagement and capacity planning across calls and streams, while safeguards control spend automatically when usage exceeds your limits.

- **Analytics captured**: Connection minutes, bandwidth usage, participant counts, and join/leave timestamps.

- **Usage protection**: Sessions that exceed connection‑minute thresholds automatically enter a grace period and then end, preventing overages.

- **Operational insight**: Use metrics to right‑size participant caps, optimize encoder bitrates, and schedule replays.

* * *

## **Courses & Communities — Battle‑Tested in Beta**

Real‑world testing ensures reliability. Media Core’s live video has already powered coaching sessions, classroom meetings, and community events at scale during beta.

- **Proven at scale**: Successfully rolled out to select beta users in **Courses** and **Communities**.

- **Seamless publishing**: Share replays in communities or course lessons to extend value beyond the live moment.

* * *

## **Embedding & Sharing Replays**

Make live content discoverable after the event. Share watch links, embed replays on sites/dashboards, or attach links in Conversations to keep engagement going.

- **Watch Page link**: Share the auto‑generated watch link with your audience.

- **Website embed**: Use an iframe snippet on funnels, websites, or dashboards. See **Embed External Content on a Dashboard** (blue) and **Embed Media from Third‑Party Platforms in Posts** (blue).

- **Library management**: Recordings appear in your Media Library with your other videos. See **Media Storage & File Upload Limits** (blue) for file specs.
