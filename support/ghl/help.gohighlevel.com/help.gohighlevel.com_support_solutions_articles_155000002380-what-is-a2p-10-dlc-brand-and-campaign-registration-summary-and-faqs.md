# **What is A2P 10DLC and the TCR?**

A2P10 DLC is a phone number registration process mandated by the United States government, specifically through The Campaign Registry (TCR). It is a required registration process for any business or individual engaging with a U.S. audience via outbound SMS. The purpose is to ensure legitimacy and adherence to guidelines when sending marketing and promotional text messages.

**“A2P” is short for Application to Person**. In this case, HighLevel is the application, and the recipient you wish to send SMS or MMS to is the person.

**“10 DLC”** is short for 10 Digit Long Code. This is both the number of digits US phone numbers contain as well as the name of the new standard.

**"The Campaign Registry (TCR)"** works with North American mobile operators and companies that are in the messaging business to register Application-to-Person (A2P) text messaging Campaigns. The registry supports a sanctioned A2P 10 Digit Long Code (10DLC) text messaging Campaign ecosystem and provides visibility into the messaging source and content, allowing mobile carriers to provide a more reliable and simple messaging service for Campaign Service Providers (CSPs) and Brands.

* * *

## **What do I need to do?**

If you do not send any messages to users in the United States using long code numbers, you do not need to do anything. If you send messages to the United States using long code numbers, you have the following registration options based on your Tax ID status, volume, and use case.

* * *

## **Types of Brand Registration**

There are four main types of Phone Registration and each have a specific use-case and pros and cons.

1. Toll-Free Number
2. Sole Prop
3. Low Volume Standard
4. Standard


|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Registration Type** | **Key Features & Description** | **Eligibility/Requirements** | **Daily Sending Limit** | **Additional Notes** |
| **Toll-Free Number** | Simpler registration process; no Tax ID requirement, no registration fees, and no daily sending limit | Open to all users; no specific business address required | None | May have lower open/pick-up rates compared to local ones |
| **Sole Prop** | Local number option for very small businesses | Businesses without a Tax ID and only one employee; requires a US or Canada business address; customers with an EIN or 2+ employees are not eligible | 3,000 segments | Only one phone number permitted |
| **Low Volume Standard** | Suitable for businesses with a Tax ID sending lower message volumes | Businesses with a Tax ID sending less than 6,000 segments per day | 6,000 segments |  |
| **Standard** | Designed for higher volume messaging | Businesses with a Tax ID sending more than 6,000 segments per day | No set limit (restrictions may apply above 200,000 segments) |  |

```

```

## **How does A2P 10DLC work?**

There are two important requirements under the new A2P 10DLC system:

1. Businesses must identify **who** they are to the carrier networks ( [**Brand registration**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001225526)).

2. Businesses must register **what** type of messages they send, i.e., notifications ( [**Campaign registration**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004539)).


Registration is done entirely through Phone System Trust Center. We have integrated with The Campaign Registry (TCR) to meet carriers' requirements while making it easy for businesses to onboard.

## **The Registration Process**

There is a three-step process to having your numbers vetted and approved before you can send SMS. Let's get a quick rundown of the process.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042928546/original/Wyz3AI2msBiyJM7O1WYJM_pcKE1rXRV7Xg.png?1741586817)

In-App registration process, learn more here: [Trust Center](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001225526)

**Brand Registration**

The client will submit business information to be reviewed. Failed or rejected Brand Submissions will need to be updated and resubmitted. Your Brand Submission must be approved before your Campaign submission is vetted.

**Campaign Registration**

After your Brand is approved, your Campaign Submission is reviewed. A campaign submission provides the TCR with the specifics of your messaging and business usage of SMS/MMS. Failed submissions will need to be updated and resubmitted.

**Carrier Propagation**

After Brand and Campaign approval, it can take up to 3 business days or longer for all carriers to receive this new information. While you can get sending immediately following approval, you may find some messages will fail - appearing with an error code saying no A2P approval is found. Rest assured! This is normal and common as it can take several business days for all carriers to receive your registered information. If the issue persists for more than 4 business days, contact HighLevel Support.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Pro Tip:** Submit both a Toll-Free then a Non Toll-Free Number registration to try to get sending faster!<br>Number registration takes 4–6 weeks, but Toll-Free approval can take as little as two days (not guaranteed). Start with Toll-Free Registration, then submit your Sole Prop, Low Volume Standard, or Standard Campaign. This often lets you start sending sooner. Once approved, you can switch to your local number. | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042928617/original/v04-8zJwl-C_2WhJYQPUPnd0M20z-px6zg.png?1741586910) |

## Required information for United States A2P 10DLC registration

### **Standard and Low Volume Standard Brands**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Business Information** | - Business Name<br>- Physical Address (Street, City, State/Province/Region, Postal Code, Country)<br>- Business Identity (Direct Customer or ISV/Reseller/Partner)<br>- Business Type (Sole Proprietorship/Partnership/Corporation /Co-Operative/LLC/Non-Profit)<br>- Company Status (Private/Public)<br>- Stock Ticker & Exchange (if Public)<br>- Business Registration Number & Type (EIN for US-based companies, other business identifiers for non-US companies)<br>- Industry<br>- Website<br>- Regions of Operations<br>- Points of Contact |

**Sole Proprietor Brands**

Sole Proprietor registration is available now. The following requirements will apply.

**No Tax ID (EIN):** To qualify for Sole Proprietor registration, you must not have an EIN (Employer Identification Number). Any business with a Tax ID (EIN) is not eligible and should instead register for a Low Volume Standard Brand.

**US or Canada only:** Sole Proprietor Brands are limited to individuals in the US and Canada.

Information required for registration:

- Brand or business name
- First name
- Last name
- Email address
- Mobile phone number (in US or Canada)
- Physical address (in US or Canada)

```
Each mobile phone number can only be used to validate up to 3 brands. Each email or physical address can only be used to validate up to 10 brands. This limit applies for all A2P registrations within the ecosystem, even brands registered outside of LeadConnector.
```

## **What’s a campaign use case?**

This represents a messaging use case, for example, sending account notifications or conducting marketing. In carrier terminology, these are called "Campaigns." For more specificity, Phone System is calling them campaign use cases.

Some companies may only need to register one campaign use case; in other scenarios, you may have multiple. For example, if you are a company that sends authentication codes to validate new users but also sends marketing messages, you should register two campaign use cases.

## **What does the campaign use case options mean?**

Your campaign use case describes the type of messaging you plan to send. This will influence the price you pay per message.

Use cases vary from notifications and fraud alerts to customer care to social updates. For more information on Campaigns and a full list of campaign use cases, please see: [List of Campaign Types and Use Case Types for A2P 10DLC registration](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000235).

## **FAQs**

## **Is Cold Texting Allowed?**

Cold Texting is when someone sends an SMS to a recipient who did not opt-in or agreed for you to message them. In other words, you are sending an SMS to someone who did not want to receive a message from you. This breaks TCR guidelines, carrier guidelines, and Phone System messaging policy. If you have not received explicit consent to message someone via SMS, do not message them. Those found cold messaging may not be approved for increased sending limits and are at a high risk for [SMS Suspension](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000079-best-practices-for-sms-deliverability-and-avoiding-sms-restrictions).

## **What information is required for registration?**

You will need information about each business and brand to register businesses, brands, and use cases. The required info includes the business name, physical address, and business type (LLC, partnership, etc.).

## **Do I need to go directly to The Campaign Registry or any other non-LC Phone System website to complete registration?**

No. Registration can be completed entirely through Phone System. Phone System has integrated directly with The Campaign Registry (TCR) to facilitate registration for our customers.

## **What if I do not have a valid Tax ID, how do I register my phone number?**

Toll-Free will be the best option to begin with, for any user, especially those without a Tax ID and/or without a US or CA Business Address.

Many Businesses attempt a Sole Prop after a US or CA Business Address.

In addition, some businesses choose to get a Tax ID or International Business Registration and then attempt Low Volume Standard or Standard. There are always restrictions and acquiring a US and CA Business Address or valid Internation Business Registration does not guarantee approval.

Consulting legal counsel is always the best option when navigating legal needs.

## **When submitting my Contact or Business Phone (OTP), can I reuse a number or use my HighLevel Number?**

You cannot use a number purchased within the HighLevel platform (or CPaaS phone number such as one obtained from Twilio.) Please provide a mobile number that you have access to confirm OTP verification.

Only US/Canadian numbers will be accepted.

You cannot use the same mobile number to register more than 3 Sole Proprietor brands.

This limit is managed at the TCR level.

## **Is MMS messaging affected by A2P 10DLC?**

Yes, MMS messaging via long code is subject to carrier fees as part of A2P 10DLC. We also expect registered MMS traffic to ultimately benefit from reduced carrier filtering. However, long code MMS messaging remains subject to throughput limits due to limited carrier capacity. A short-code is still the best option for high-volume MMS use cases in the United States.

## **Is WhatsApp messaging affected by A2P 10DLC?**

No. WhatsApp messaging is unaffected by any of these changes. WhatsApp messages are transmitted over the Internet rather than through carrier networks like SMS and MMS.

## **What if your address has changed since you received the CP 575 form?**

Suppose your address has changed since you received the CP 575 form, which is the form issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to assign an Employer Identification Number (EIN). In that case, updating your address with the IRS is important to ensure they have your current contact information.

To update your address with the IRS, you can follow these steps:

1. Fill out Form 8822, "Change of Address," which is the official form to notify the IRS of your new address. You can obtain this form from the IRS website or by contacting the IRS directly.
2. Provide your updated address information on Form 8822, including your EIN, old address, and new address.
3. Sign and date the form.
4. Mail the completed Form 8822 to the appropriate IRS address as specified in the form's instructions. Make sure to send it to the correct IRS office based on your location and the type of entity you are (e.g., individual, corporation, partnership).

By updating your address with the IRS, you ensure that they have accurate information for your business and can send important correspondence and documents to the correct address.

It's also a good practice to update your address with any other relevant entities, such as your state or local tax authorities, business partners, and service providers, to ensure they have your current contact information.

## **What is a Trust Score, and how does it affect me?**

When you complete the registration of your Brand and Campaign(s) for A2P Messaging through the Phone System Console, that information is sent from Phone System to The Campaign Registry (TCR), a 3rd party at the center of this new registration system. Phone System automatically submits your Brand for secondary vetting, which uses a reputation algorithm to review specific criteria relating to your company and assign a Trust Score to determine your messaging throughput and T-Mobile daily message limits.

## **How do Trust Scores influence message throughput?**

Trust Scores are grouped into three levels, from lowest to highest. Your Trust Score level and Campaign Type will determine the message throughput allocated to your campaign use case.

For details, see [Message throughput (MPS) and Trust Scores for A2P 10DLC in the US.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004527)

## **Can I buy new phone numbers to use this A2P 10DLC service?**

Buying new numbers is unnecessary if you already use long code numbers. Following the registration process will enable your existing numbers to use the new A2P 10DLC service.

## **What pricing and fees are associated with the A2P 10DLC service?**

For an overview of registration costs and per-message carrier fees associated with A2P 10DLC, please see the [pricing and fees associated with the A2P 10DLC service.](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803965530-What-pricing-and-fees-are-associated-with-the-A2P-10DLC-service-)

## **How long does it take to get registered?**

A2P 10DLC registration is a multiple-step process that includes registering a Business Profile, a US A2P Brand, and a [Campaign use case.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000235)

Brand registration can typically be completed in a few minutes if you've collected all the required information. For example, when registering a US-based business, you should ensure your Employer Identification Number (EIN) is ready when you begin registration. However, in the event that there is a discrepancy with the information you provide, a manual review may be required for Secondary Vetting, which can take up to 7 days. To avoid this, please see [A2P 10 DLC Brand Approval Best Practices](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405758341659-A2P-10DLC-Brand-Approval-Best-Practices)

## **Once I complete registration, how do I ensure my phone numbers use 10DLC?**

Once your Brand(s) and Campaign(s) are approved, you must link each of your A2P Campaign Use Cases to a Messaging Service and add phone numbers to that Messaging Service. Any numbers that you add to that Messaging Service will be automatically associated with the Campaign that you linked to that Messaging Service.

## **What message-sending throughput (MPS) do I get?**

Message throughput (MPS) will be allocated per registered Campaign Use Case. For many customers, A2P 10DLC will offer much higher throughput than the traditional 1 MPS for long code messaging without requiring additional numbers to get higher throughput.

For details, see [Message throughput (MPS) and Trust Scores for A2P 10DLC in the US.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004527)

## **Can I start texting the same day I register?**

Yes, but they will get filtered after a couple of messages are sent and will receive a [30007: Message filtered.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30007) A workaround until the brand is approved would be to get a toll-free number.

## **Does this A2P Registration differ if we are using Twilio numbers through GHL?**

Yes, if you use your own Twilio account directly, you will complete the registration through your Twilio console. however, it is still necessary to have done, even if you are not using Lead Connector.
