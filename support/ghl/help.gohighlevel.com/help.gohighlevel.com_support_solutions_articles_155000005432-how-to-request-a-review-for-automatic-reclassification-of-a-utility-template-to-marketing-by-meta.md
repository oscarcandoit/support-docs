# How to Request a Review for Automatic Reclassification of a Utility Template to Marketing by Meta

Modified on: Wed, 4 Jun, 2025 at 6:24 AM

### **Overview**

When submitting a WhatsApp message template under the **Utility** category, it may initially get approved as expected. However, Meta may **automatically reclassify** the template as **Marketing** after their internal review. This change can occur either instantly or over time,

`
`

This can happen if Meta’s automated systems determine that the content aligns more with promotional messaging than transactional or service-related communication.

### **Good News: You Can Request a Review**

Meta provides a **45-day window** to **manually appeal** this reclassification. If your appeal is approved, the correct classification (`utility`) will be restored, and the API will then show:

### **Steps to Raise a Review Request with Meta**

Follow these steps to submit a review request via WhatsApp Manager:

#### 1\. **Go to WhatsApp Manager**

Visit [Meta's WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/message-templates) and log in with your Business Manager credentials. and **Go to Manage Template tab** for affected facebook business account.

2: Go to **Review category updates in Business Support Home** as highlighted in below screenshot

3: Select the template you wish to appeal, then click the **"Request Review"** button to submit it for evaluation.

4: After the review request is submitted, the template will appear under the **"In Review"** tab. Meta will then evaluate the request and, if approved, update the template to the correct category.

### **Best Practices to Avoid Reclassification**

- Ensure your template content is strictly transactional or service-related

- Avoid any promotional language or call-to-action that might seem like marketing

- Use clear, concise wording focused on the user’s request or account status
