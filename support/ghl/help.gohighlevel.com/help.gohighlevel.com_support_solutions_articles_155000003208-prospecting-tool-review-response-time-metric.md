## **What's New:**

Introducing an enhancement to our Prospecting Tool! We’ve added functionality to calculate the review response time for reviews with replies and display this information in the audit report.

## **Key Feature:**

Prospecting tool now includes the Average Review Response Time metric in the audit report for reviews received on Google and Facebook for prospects. This vital information is seamlessly incorporated into the marketing audit report, ensuring you have all the crucial insights about the prospect's review management.

## **Benefit For Users:**

1. As an Agency, this helps me identify if Prospect has any review response automation already in place.
2. As an Agency, I can use this data as a strong selling point in marketing/sales and offer my solution/services.

**Note:**

- For older prospects, access this information by refreshing the reports.
- More value addition to Marketing Audit Report.
