# **What are Granular Permission Controls for Voice AI  Agents?**

Granular permission controls for Voice AI Agents give teams the flexibility to assign role-specific access while protecting sensitive configurations and workflows. Using four distinct toggles, you can govern different parts of the Voice AI experience. Instead of an "all‑or‑nothing" approach, you can decide who creates agents, who tweaks their goals, and who sees performance data.

With these settings, users can:

- Control who can view or manage agents

- Define access to goal configuration features

- Separate dashboard visibility from editing privileges


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Voice AI Granular Permissions**

Fine‑tuned permissions help you balance security with productivity.

- **Protect AI Agent Edits:** Prevent unintentional edits to AI agent logic by giving users only the access they need

- **Ensure Operational Clarity:** Separate permissions for dashboards, goals, and agent configuration to ensure each user understands their specific scope

- **Support Scalable On** **boarding:** Easily assign appropriate access for support, training, and admin as your team or agency grows

* * *

## **How  to  Configure Granular Permissions**

Setting up granular Voice AI permissions uses the Roles & Permissions panel. Follow these steps to configure the granular permissions:

- From your sub-account, click **Settings** in the lower left corner

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Are these permissions available at the agency level?**

Granular Voice AI permissions are set per sub‑account.

**Q: Can I copy the same permission set to multiple users?**

Yes. Go to **Settings > My Staff** and select the user you would like to apply the new permissions to. Click **Copy Permission** in the top right copy and select the user to copy the permissions from. This will affect all permissions, not only Voice AI Permissions.

**Q: How can I safely test a custom Voice AI permission set?**

Create a temporary user, apply permissions then verify that the visibility matches your expectations before rolling out to the wider team.

**Q: Do these toggles affect Conversation AI chatbots?**

No. They only govern Voice AI phone agents. Conversation AI has its own permission set.
