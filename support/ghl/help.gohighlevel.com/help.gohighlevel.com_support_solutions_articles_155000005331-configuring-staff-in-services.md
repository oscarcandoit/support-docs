# **Overview of Configuring Staff in Services**

The Staff panel allows you to manage the individuals responsible for delivering services. Whether you’re working solo or running a team, staff profiles are critical to booking functionality. Only services assigned to active, available staff members can be booked by customers.

You can define staff details, assign services, set working hours, and configure availability with precision to ensure smooth scheduling.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Configuring Staff**

Organizing staff at the Services level ensures bookings follow the right person’s schedule and options.

- **Staff Visibility:** Assign services to make a staff member appear in the booking flow for specific services.

- **Centralized Availability:** Manage each staff member’s hours and availability in one place.

- **Flexibility:** Create multiple time slots per day to accommodate changes such as breaks.

- **Service-Specific Pricing:** Define pricing at the staff level for assigned services.

- **Appointment Limits:** Limit how many appointments a staff member can receive per day.

- **Quick Management:** Edit staff details and options anytime.


* * *

## **Accessing the Staff Panel**

To access the staff panel, navigate to **Calendar > Calendar Settings > Services > Staff**

From here, you can:

- View a list of staff with their **name, email, phone number, and role** (admin/user).

- Use the **search bar and sorting options** to quickly find staff.

- Add new staff or manage existing ones.

- Share a staff member’s booking page link.

## **Adding a Staff Member**

When adding or editing staff, you'll see the following fields:

Basic Details:

- **Profile Picture** – Upload an image to represent staff on booking/scheduling pages.

- **First & Last Name** _(required)_ – Shown internally and on the booking interface.

- **Email** _(required)_ – Must be unique; used for login and notifications.

- **Phone Number** – Optional.

- **Timezone** – Determines the timezone the staff member works in.

- **Custom URL** – Generate a unique booking link for the staff member.

- **Default Availability** \- Configure base working hours (e.g., 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM).


**Default availability** is the baseline schedule applied to a staff member whenever they are added to a service. Think of it as the “starting point” for their working hours.

- Without availability, services assigned to a staff member cannot be booked — so setting it up is essential.

- Default availability ensures that the staff member is bookable across all services right away.

- You can **override or refine** this schedule later using **Weekly Working Hours** (for recurring patterns) or **Date-Specific Hours** (for one-off adjustments).


**Example:**

If Hannah’s default availability is set to **Mon–Fri, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM**, then whenever she’s assigned to a service, those hours will automatically be used. You can later edit her schedule if she works shorter hours for a specific service or takes a day off.

## **Editing a Staff Member / Advanced Settings**

Click the pencil icon next to any staff member to edit. You can update their profile, assign services, configure availability, and set advanced options.

#### **1\. Basic Details**

This tab allows you to make changes to the staff member's core profile fields:

- Update name, email, phone number, or profile picture

- Adjust the staff member’s timezone

- Set or change the custom booking URL

- Configure their default availability

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155052231641/original/tl2eSakY-aHCRL7QXld4ORkHS4oBhGkyRQ.png?1756023742)

#### **2\. Assigning Services**

In the **Assign Services** tab, you can select one or multiple services the staff member will provide

- **Service-Specific Pricing (New):** Adjust prices for each service if this staff member charges differently.
- **Appointment Limits (New):** Optionally cap the number of appointments per day/week/month that can be assigned to this staff member.

```
Note: Assigning services is mandatory for the staff to appear in the booking flow.
```

The **Weekly Working Hours** tab allows you to configure the staff member’s regular availability:

- Set the working days in a week

- Add multiple time slots per day

- Assign services which would be provided during these slots

- Assign locations wherein the service would be provided during these slots


Breaks can be created by inserting separate work periods (e.g., 9:00–11:00 and 12:00–5:00).

#### **4\. Date-Specific Hours**

Override weekly hours for special days:

- Mark the staff as available or unavailable for any specific time/day

- Define custom time blocks for specific dates

- These can be configured for specific services and locations as well


Use this for one-off adjustments like holidays, special events, or ad hoc scheduling changes.

## **Understanding Availability**

There are **three levels of availability** you can set for staff:

- **Default Availability**: A baseline schedule that’s applied automatically whenever a staff member is assigned to a service for the first time. Think of it as a quick-start helper.

- **Weekly Working Hours**: The staff member’s **actual recurring schedule**. This is what truly controls when they’re bookable week after week.

- **Date-Specific Hours**: One-off overrides for special cases like holidays, events, or temporary changes.


| **Type** | **What It Means** | **When It’s Used** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Default Availability** | A template schedule applied **across all services** when staff are first assigned. It auto-fills weekly hours so services are bookable immediately. | To avoid adding the same schedule manually every time a staff member is added to a service. | Hannah’s default is Mon–Fri, 9 AM–5 PM. When she’s added to any service, those hours appear automatically. |
| **Weekly Working Hours** | The staff member’s **real weekly schedule**, which can be edited per service. This is what determines ongoing bookability. | To customize availability for each service, or adjust to reflect the staff’s actual working routine. | Hannah changes her weekly hours so she works Mon–Thu, 10 AM–4 PM for Massage, but Fri 12–6 PM for Hair Cut. |
| **Date-Specific Hours** | One-time overrides that replace weekly/default availability for a given date. | To handle exceptions like holidays, time off, or temporary extra shifts. | Hannah marks herself unavailable on May 27th for a personal event. |

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- Always **assign staff to at least one active service and location** for them to be bookable.

- **Ensure** that the staff has **availability set** for the assigned services for them to be bookable.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do I set lunch breaks or mid-day gaps?**

In Weekly Working Hours, add multiple time slots for the day (e.g., 9:00 AM–12:00 PM and 1:00 PM–5:00 PM).

**Q: How do I let customers pick which staff member to book with?**

Turn on **Allow customers to pick who they book with** in **Global Settings → Booking Page**.

**Q: If I set both Weekly Working Hours and Date-Specific Hours, which one wins?**

Date-Specific Hours override Weekly Working Hours for the selected date(s). Use this for holidays, special events, or one-off exceptions
