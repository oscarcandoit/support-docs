# **What is the Hide Countdown Timers in Apple Mail feature?**

Apple Mail on iOS 15+ preloads email content, freezing countdown timers at the moment of delivery. The “Hide for Apple users” feature prevents these timers from displaying at all in Apple Mail, ensuring customers don’t see expired or misleading countdowns.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Hide Countdown Timers in Apple Mail**

This feature helps preserve the credibility of your time-sensitive promotions by preventing outdated countdown visuals in Apple Mail clients. Here's how it helps:

- **Accuracy:** Ensures Apple Mail users don't see frozen or expired timers.

- **Trust:** Reduces confusion that might lead users to distrust your campaign’s urgency.

- **Simplicity:** One-click enablement in the timer settings.

- **Broad Compatibility:** Only Apple Mail is affected, all other clients still see the timer.

- **Fewer Support Issues:** Avoids complaints or questions about incorrect timers.

## **How To Setup Hide Countdown Timers in Apple Mail**

Properly enabling this setting prevents visual inconsistencies for Apple users while maintaining functionality for everyone else. Here's how to set it up:

#### **Step 1:** Edit an Existing Timer or Create a New One

1. From your HighLevel dashboard, navigate to **Marketing → Countdown Timers**

2. Either click the **Pencil** icon to edit an existing timer or click **\+ New** to create a new one

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why are timers inaccurate in Apple Mail?**

Apple Mail caches content to protect privacy, so timers freeze at delivery time rather than updating live.

**Q: What happens if I don’t enable this feature?**

Apple Mail users will see outdated timers, reducing urgency and potentially harming trust.

**Q: Do timers still redirect after expiry even if hidden?**

Yes, as long as you're using a dynamic link in a button, expiry redirection still works.

**Q: Will other email clients still display the timer?**

Yes, this setting only affects Apple Mail clients.

**Q: Can I enable this for an existing timer?**

Absolutely. Edit the timer, check the box in the Styling tab, and save.
