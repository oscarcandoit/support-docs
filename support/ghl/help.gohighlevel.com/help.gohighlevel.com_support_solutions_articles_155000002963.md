What's new?

- You can now add recurring products to your product list in Document Builder

![Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155030366152/original/nRDGDbXV-Wl5QPq4xFEgnX6IHKriBMJG1w.png?1722612238)

- If your product has a set up fee associated, it would show up as a separate row item

![Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155030366154/original/pMvXR0AqH_DjLSpK2UVodI82SkACe6ybqQ.jpeg?1722612239)

- If you add a one time product and recurring product together in the list, the one time product will only be charged to the user in the first invoice.
- You can also add a recurring schedule to your Document templates
with capability to assign start date as the completed date of the document.

How to use?

- Add a product list to your document

![Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155030366153/original/wyYHwwPV7EiG8ZtrNhy5y_m-1XeuR0rMgg.jpeg?1722612239)

- Add recurring as well as one time products in the product list
- If a recurring product is added, add a schedule from the product list properties and set invoice sending date as document completed date or a custom date. (Enabled in templates as well)
- Once the document is completed, an invoice will be sent (recurring if at least 1 recurring product was added, One time if none was added)
- Set up fee associated with a product is shown separately in the product list

Why did we build it?

- In our effort to streamline acceptance of invoices after Document Signature, recurring products and set up fee of products were stopping a lot of you from using contracts. No longer.

What's next on Payments via Documents and Contracts

- 2 In 1 Documents: Showing invoice directly after primary signer signs the document
- One time Deposit: Collecting a %age of the total product value in the invoice
