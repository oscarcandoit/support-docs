# Smart Prompts for Bulk SaaS Enablement

Modified on: Fri, 27 Jun, 2025 at 12:02 PM

Unlock more value from your sub-accounts by identifying all clients who aren’t yet on SaaS and giving you a guided workflow to enable them all in bulk.

* * *

```
Conditions for Guided Bulk SaaS Activation:
- Agency on the $497/mo Pro plan
- Smart Prompts for SaaS Enablement enabled in Labs
- Have more than 10 subaccounts
- At least 1 subaccount not on SaaS

Results of Bulk SaaS Activation:
- Specified subaccounts will automatically be converted to SaaS
- If a subaccount has a card on file, there will be no interruption
- If a subaccount does not have a card on file, then the subaccount will be locked until the client adds a card
```

## **How To Use Guided Bulk SaaS Activation**

**Step 1: Navigate to Sub-Accounts and click the Prompt**

On your Agency Account > Sub-accounts page, if the conditions are met, you will see the prompt in yellow. Click the words "Click here to enable SaaS".
