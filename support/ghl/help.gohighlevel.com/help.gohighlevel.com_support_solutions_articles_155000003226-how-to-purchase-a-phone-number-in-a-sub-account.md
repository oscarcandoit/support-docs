## **Can't Find a Number with Your Desired Area Code?**

### **1\. Why This Happens-**

| Cause | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Limited Inventory** | - HighLevel sources phone numbers via **Twilio**, and Twilio’s inventory of available numbers changes regularly.<br>  <br>- If no numbers are currently available in your selected area code, it will not appear as an option. |
| **High-Demand Area Codes** | - Some area codes, especially in **highly populated or legacy regions**, may have limited or no availability due to demand.<br>  <br>- This is common in areas like New York (212), Los Angeles (310), and San Francisco (415). |

### **2\.  Workarounds and Solutions-**

1. **Try Nearby Area Codes:** Search for nearby or overlay area codes (e.g., if 310 is unavailable, try 424 in Los Angeles).

2. **Use Toll-Free or National Numbers:** If local presence isn’t critical, consider a toll-free (e.g., 888, 877) or national number, which often have more availability.

3. **Contact HighLevel Support to request availability or notification**


**Note-  If you don't find any international number to purchase, follow this guide- [How to request a number that is not available](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001231625-how-to-request-a-number-that-s-not-available-)**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I purchase multiple phone numbers for the same sub-account?**

Yes, you can purchase multiple numbers. This is helpful for managing different departments, services, or geographic regions within the same sub-account.

**Q: Do I need a separate number for each user?**

Not necessarily. One number can serve multiple users if routed correctly, but for personalized outbound messaging and tracking, dedicated numbers per user are recommended.

**Q: What should I do if I can’t find a number with my preferred area code?**

If no numbers are available in your preferred area code, try refreshing the results to see new available options. Phone number availability changes frequently. You can also search using broader filters or nearby area codes. If you still don’t see what you need, contact HighLevel Support to request assistance or check on availability for your region.

**Q: Will I be charged monthly for purchased phone numbers?**

Yes. you will be charged a small monthly rental fee for each number. Rates vary based on the type (local or toll-free) and region.

**Q: Can I import a phone number I already own in Twilio?**

Yes! You can import existing Twilio numbers. Follow this guide: [Import Existing Twilio Numbers into HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000981421)
