# How to redirect a user to a specific page after signing a contract?

Modified on: Thu, 20 Feb, 2025 at 12:14 AM

### Overview

You can now redirect customers to a specific web page after they’ve signed your Document or completed a payment on an invoice generated via the Document. This helps create a seamless, branded experience—whether that’s showing them a thank-you page, leading them to a scheduling link, or upselling additional services.

### 1\. Enable Global Custom URL Redirection

1. **Navigate to Documents & Contracts**
   - In the left menu, go to **Payments** → **Documents & Contracts**.
2. **Open Settings**
   - Click the **Settings** button at the top-right (gear icon).
   - Select **Document Settings** from the sidebar.
3. **Toggle on “Redirect to a Custom URL”**
   - Flip the switch to enable it globally for all Documents.
   - Enter the URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
   - Choose **Open in Existing Tab** or **Open in New Tab**.
4. **Save Your Changes**
   - Click **Save** to confirm.

> **Note:** Global settings will not override a custom URL added directly to a specific Document or Template.

### 2\. Set Up a Custom URL Per Document

1. **Create or Edit a Document**
   - From **Documents & Contracts**, open any existing Document or click **\+ New** to create one.
2. **Document Settings**
   - At the top, click **Settings** → **Document Settings**.
3. **Enable Redirect & Enter URL**
   - Toggle on **Enable redirection to custom URL**.
   - Enter the desired URL.
   - Select if it should open in the same tab or a new tab.
4. **Save Your Document**
   - Click **Save** or **Send** as needed.

### 3\. Redirection After Payment

If you’ve enabled a Payment option within your Document, the same redirect settings apply once payment is made:

- **Global Setting**: If enabled, your customers are automatically redirected after their payment is processed.
- **Document-Level Setting**: If you’ve enabled and specified a URL here, it takes priority for that specific Document.

### 4\. Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Test Before Sending**: Use the **Preview** option in Documents to confirm that the redirect works as expected.
- **Override Logic**: Document-specific redirects will override global redirects. Turn off or remove the Document-level setting if you want to rely solely on the global redirect.

### 5\. Common Use Cases

- **Thank-You Pages**: Direct new signers/payers to a personalized thank-you or confirmation page.
- **Onboarding**: Prompt customers to complete onboarding steps immediately after signing.
- **Upsells**: Show complementary offers or scheduling pages to drive further engagement.
- **Reviews:** Get reviews from your users after they've signed a completion agreement.
