# Why does my Domain not show the Edit Button?

Modified on: Fri, 9 Oct, 2020 at 3:38 PM

Edit button is only shown on one location, where you first add the domain. It will not be shown in other locations since the default page can only have one value.

Why is my Domain not showing the Edit Button?

I"ve done this, as I did with your representative on the chat, and previously said that this is not the issue. Thank you.

I know this. I have checked every other sub account. This domain is not there.

Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.
