### **Step 2: Locating the Opportunity to Edit**

- Once you're in the Opportunities section, locate the opportunity you wish to edit.
- You can use search filters or browse through the list of opportunities to find the specific one you need to update.
- Click on the name or title of the opportunity to open its details page.


### **Step 3: Opening the Opportunity Details Page**

- In the opportunity details page, you'll find fields containing information about the opportunity.
- Update any relevant details such as the contact's name, contact information, opportunity value, and opportunity source.
- You can also modify pipeline stages, owners, tags, or any other custom fields associated with the opportunity.

### **Step 4: Adding Notes and Attachments**

- If necessary, add new notes or additional information about the opportunity by clicking on the "Notes" option in the left sidebar.
- All notes added here will also reflect in the corresponding contact's notes also. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020571657/original/tC5JO6oMJNYfGXoMSzLLcLhbaBgk2Rg3xA.png?1707937616)

### **Step 5: Setting Tasks and Reminders**

- If there are specific tasks or follow-up actions associated with the opportunity, set tasks and reminders as needed by opening it from the sidebar.
- Assign tasks to yourself or team members, specifying due dates and priority levels.
- Similarly, you can also add appointments in the same way.
- Tasks and appointments added this way will also reflect on the contact's end.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020571868/original/S4Qjo6xl8H4zY3zSXkRicd3bLz0_sXsdLA.png?1707938062)

**Step 6: Managing Pipeline Stages**

- Adjust the pipeline stage of the opportunity to reflect its current status in the sales process.
- Move the opportunity through different stages as it progresses towards closure, updating its status accordingly.

### **Step 7: Managing Opportunity Status**

- Drag and drop the opportunity to any status as seen in the bottom to update it's status.
- Possible statuses for an opportunity are "Open", "Won", "Lost" and "Abandoned". Default status for a new opportunity is "Open".
- Marking an opportunity lost also allows you to add a lost reason for the same.
