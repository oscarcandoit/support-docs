# Phone Number Edit Configuration (Incoming Calls Settings)

Modified on: Fri, 31 Oct, 2025 at 7:35 PM

The “Incoming Call Settings” interface puts every factor that routes an inbound call into one set of settings. With quick-edit controls and handy links to advanced pages, you can diagnose call-flow issues and update settings in seconds, without hunting through multiple menus.

## **What is Edit Configuration (Incoming Call Settings)?**

This redesigned interface consolidates every element that can intercept or redirect an incoming call (IVR, forwarding, AI, etc) into a single, easy-to-read window. Each row shows (1) whether the factor is enabled, (2) which record is responsible, and (3) an Edit action or deep link so you can adjust the setting immediately. By visualizing priority order, the screen eliminates guesswork when a call doesn’t ring where you expect.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Incoming Call Settings**

- Full transparency - see exactly which rule will answer first, second, and third.

- Inline editing - toggle or update most settings without leaving the page.

- Clear Priority - learn the fixed order the system follows.

- Troubleshooting speed - quickly spot mis-configured numbers or missing users.

- Fewer missed calls - optimize routing so prospects always reach a person.

- Time savings - no more digging through separate menus for each feature.


* * *

## **Access Phone Number Edit Configuration**

## **Understanding Call-Flow Priority**

The simplified UI lists factors top-to-bottom in the exact order the system evaluates them:

1. Workflow, IVR, or other Automation attached to the number
2. User assigned to the phone number
3. User assigned to the contact record
4. Ring Incoming Call to Multiple Users (Ring-All)
5. Forwarding Number

Each option will have a badge on it like "1st priority", "2nd priority", etc. Only one option will ring. The system will ring the highest priority that is available. For example, if user Andy Anderson is 1st Priority, but is not logged in to any systems and has no phone number, then the system would check 2nd Priority.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Who can access the simplified settings?**

A: Any user with permission to manage Phone Numbers can view and edit this screen.

**Q: Does enabling the new UI change my existing call logic?**

A: No. It only surfaces and lets you modify the rules already in place.

**Q: Can I still reach advanced options like Whisper Messages or Call Recording?**

A: Yes—click the deep-link next to “Forwarding Number” or open the full Edit Configuration page for the number.

**Q: What happens if multiple rules are active?**

A: The system follows the fixed priority order shown on the screen; lower items are ignored once a higher rule answers.

**Q: Is Ring-All still limited to seven users?**

A: Yes—the modal enforces the current platform limit of seven simultaneous rings.
