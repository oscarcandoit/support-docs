# **Overview of Adding Guests in Calendar Bookings**

The Add Guests feature allows customers to include additional attendees during the appointment booking process. This ensures the business has a complete list of all individuals participating in the session. With recent enhancements, Add Guests now supports mandatory guest entry and automatic payment calculation based on total attendee count.

These upgrades are especially useful for businesses where multiple attendees are standard, such as therapy practices, fitness classes, group consultations, or restaurants.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Add Guests to Bookings**

Gain greater control over group bookings while minimizing errors in guest data and payment processing.

- Collect accurate payments based on the total number of attendees

- Ensure required guest details are captured at the time of booking.

- Display complete guest lists in appointment records.

- Optionally collect guest email addresses for communications.

- Track attendance and group sizes more effectively.

- Minimize payment confusion and reduce support inquiries.

* * *

## **How To Enable Add Guests Features**

Use the Calendar settings to activate both guest collection and attendee-based payment options.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Calendars** in your HighLevel dashboard.

## **Require Guests for Booking**

This setting is useful for businesses that depend on the participation of more than one individual in each session. When enabled, it ensures that the user cannot proceed with the booking unless at least one guest is added.

Guest details, such as name and optionally email, must be provided before the booking can be submitted. This helps businesses like therapy practices, group fitness instructors, or event venues maintain clear attendance records and ensure operational readiness.

* * *

## **Collect Payment for All Attendees**

This feature enables businesses to automatically charge the customer based on the total number of attendees, including the primary booker and any added guests.

Instead of charging a fixed fee per booking, the system multiplies the per-person rate by the number of attendees. This provides more accurate billing for services that are priced per participant.

**Use cases include:**

- Workshops and training events

- Group consultations or treatments

- Restaurant or event bookings

- Any service priced on a per-person basis


**How it works:**

- The total price is calculated as: Service Price × (1 booker + number of guests)

- The booker is charged the total amount at the time of booking via the connected payment gateway.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I collect email addresses for each guest?**

Yes. You can configure your form to collect guest names and email addresses, which is helpful for sending confirmations and reminders.

**Q: Is it mandatory to enable both features?**

No. You can enable each setting independently. You may choose to require guests without enabling per-attendee payments, or vice versa.

**Q: What happens if a guest cancels but the booker still attends?**

Refunds or changes must be handled manually, as the payment is collected based on the booking form at the time of submission.

**Q: Do guests receive confirmation emails?**

Guests will only receive confirmation emails if their email addresses are collected and guest-specific notifications are configured using workflows or triggers.

**Q: Can the booker add multiple guests?**

Yes. The booking form supports multiple guest entries. The number of guests can be configured based on your service or appointment type.
