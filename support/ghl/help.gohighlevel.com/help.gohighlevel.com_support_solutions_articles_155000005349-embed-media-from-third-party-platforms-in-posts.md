# Embedding Media from Third-Party Platforms in Posts

## ✨ Overview

You can now enhance your posts by embedding media directly from popular third-party platforms. Whether it’s a **video, podcast, demo, or track**, you can embed it using either a **media link** or an **embed code**—no uploads required.

This makes your content more dynamic, interactive, and efficient to manage.

* * *

## ✅ Supported Platforms

We currently support media embedding from:

**For** **Video,**

- **YouTube**

- **Vimeo**

- **Loom**


**For Audio,**

- **SoundCloud**

- **Wistia**

- **Spotify**

- **Mixcloud**


You can use **iframe embed code** from these platforms.

* * *

## ?️ How to Embed Media

1. Go to the **Post Edit Page**.

2. Select "Upload Audio/Video" Option.

3. Click on **Embed Media**.

4. Paste code from a supported platform.

5. The media will render in your post preview instantly.


This method is ideal for quick use and supported platforms.

### **Getting an Embed Code (iframe)**

1. Go to the desired media on the third-party platform.

2. Look for the **"Share"** or **"Embed"** option (typically found under the media).

3. Copy the provided **iframe embed code** (it will start with `<iframe...>`).

4. Paste the iframe code in the **Embed Media** modal on the Post Edit Page.


? **Note:** Width and height are **automatically adjusted** to fit your post layout, so you don’t need to modify the embed code.

* * *

## ⚖️ Copyright & Usage Compliance

> ❗ **Reminder:** You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to embed third-party content.

Before embedding, confirm:

- The content is **public** or **permissioned for sharing**.

- You have the **legal right** to display the content.

- You are complying with the source platform’s **terms of service** and **usage guidelines**.


? Do not embed content that’s private, licensed without permission, or marked as non-shareable.

* * *

## ? Best Practices

- Always test your post using the **preview** feature to ensure embeds load correctly.

- Avoid shortened or redirected links; use **official embed codes**.

- Educate your team on content licensing to avoid violations.
