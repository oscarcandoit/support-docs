# Association Limits

Modified on: Wed, 15 Oct, 2025 at 1:38 AM

## What Are Association Limits?

Association limits let you control how many records can be linked together between objects. These rules ensure data remains organized, prevent over-association, and are now visually enforced in the UI.

## What Are Association Limits?

-  Avoids over-linking between records.

- Helps keep data structures clean.

- Reduces user confusion when the limits are reached with clear UI feedback.


## Supported Relationship Types

### For multi-label associations:

- One-to-One (1:1)

- One-to-N (where N ≤ 1000)

- One-to-Many

- Many-to-Many


### For single-label contact-to-contact associations:

- One-to-One (1:1)

- Many-to-Many

- Custom N-to-N


Note: Limits are enforced per label and reflected in the user interface.

## How to Set Up Association Limits

1. Go to your sub-account, Navigate to Settings > Objects

2. Select any Custom Object or Contacts![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047099121/original/j94NQGkBL1lsLO6m8jvWXcoDH_MzVAAOEQ.png?1747948523)

3. Go to the Associations tab, Click Create Association or edit an existing one

4. Choose either a single label or a pair of labels.

5. Under Configure Relationship, select the type (e.g. 1:1, 1:N) and define limits if applicable

6. Use the Preview section to confirm constraints before saving.

7. The configured associations are also shown in the associations tab.

## Example: Real Estate Management

A real estate agency wants to ensure that each Agent manages no more than 50 Properties:

- Create a one-to-N relationship from Agent to Property

- Set the limit as N = 50

- When an agent hits this cap, users will see a UI warning and can no longer assign more properties, ensuring balanced workloads.


## Association Limits:

- If you try to associate beyond the allowed count, an error message will be shown instantly, this helps in clear and efficient management of the data-structures
