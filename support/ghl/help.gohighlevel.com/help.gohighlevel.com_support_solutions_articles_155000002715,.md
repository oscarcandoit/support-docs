## **Improve Customer Experience with a Marketing Opt-Out Button**

You can now add a **Marketing Opt-Out button** to new promotional WhatsApp templates—giving your customers greater control over how they receive communications from your business. This optional feature offers several strategic benefits and supports a more personalized, compliant, and scalable marketing experience.

* * *

**Why Add a Marketing Opt-Out Button?**

**1\. Reduce Block Rates**

Customers often block businesses if they cannot easily opt out of marketing messages. Including an opt-out button gives users a non-intrusive alternative, helping you:

    •    Avoid high block rates

    •    Prevent campaign suspensions

    •    Protect your phone number’s quality rating

**2\. Enable Faster Campaign Scaling**

As you expand your marketing outreach on WhatsApp, quality metrics become increasingly important. Offering an opt-out button:

    •    Helps maintain high-quality scores

    •    Minimizes template rejection due to user blocks

    •    Supports quicker increases in messaging limits

**3\. Respect Customer Preferences**

Adding an opt-out option helps ensure:

    •    Customers receive only the content they’re interested in

    •    You can continue sending critical service or transactional messages

    •    Trust and transparency are built into every interaction

**4\. Gain Actionable Customer Insights**

When customers opt out (instead of blocking), you gain visibility into their behavior and preferences. This feedback loop helps:

    •    Improve your messaging strategy

    •    Tailor future marketing campaigns

    •    Understand why customers disengage

* * *

**Best Practices for a Seamless Opt-Out Experience**

**Honor Opt-Out Requests**

Once a customer opts out, stop sending marketing messages across **all of your WhatsApp numbers**. Continued marketing communication after opt-out can lead to negative feedback and blocked numbers.

**Send Confirmation Messages**

After an opt-out, send:

    •    A confirmation message acknowledging the request

    •    A re-subscribe link or option in case they change their mind

    •    A short feedback request to understand their decision

**Use the Button Strategically**

Avoid overuse of the opt-out button to prevent unnecessary disengagement. Instead, include it in:

    •    The **first marketing message** you send to a new contact

    •    Messages sent **after a long pause** in communication

    •    Campaigns targeting **low-engagement users**

By integrating the opt-out button thoughtfully, you’ll boost customer satisfaction, safeguard your messaging performance, and maintain compliance with WhatsApp’s best practices.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1: Is the opt-out button mandatory for marketing templates?**

**A:** No, the opt-out button is optional. However, it’s recommended for better customer experience and to reduce the chances of your messages being blocked.

**Q2: Can customers still receive service messages after opting out?**

**A:** Yes. Opting out applies only to marketing messages. Customers will still receive essential service, transactional, or support-related messages.

**Q3: What happens if a customer blocks my number instead of opting out?**

**A:** Blocks affect your phone number’s quality score and can limit your ability to scale messaging. Using the opt-out button offers a less harmful alternative for disengaged users.

**Q4: Should I include the opt-out button in every message?**

**A:** No. Overuse may encourage unnecessary opt-outs. Add it only where strategic—such as in first messages or re-engagement campaigns.

**Q5: Will I be notified when someone opts out?**

**A:** Yes. You will receive webhook notifications, allowing you to track and manage opt-outs effectively and adjust your campaign accordingly.
