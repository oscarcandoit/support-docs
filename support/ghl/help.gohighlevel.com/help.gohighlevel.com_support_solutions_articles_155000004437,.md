# **What is the Quiz Submitted Trigger?**

The Quiz Submitted trigger is a workflow entry condition that activates whenever a contact finishes and submits a published quiz in HighLevel. This feature helps businesses, educators, and marketers streamline engagement, automate responses, and optimize quiz-based interactions. By adding this trigger you can automatically enroll contacts into any workflow the instant their quiz data is recorded, enabling real‑time engagement and tailored journeys.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Quiz Submitted Trigger**

The Quiz Submitted trigger equips you to react quickly and at scale whenever someone completes a quiz.

- **Real‑Time Engagement:** Respond the second a participant submits their quiz, boosting open rates and conversion

- **Advanced Filters**: Configure conditions such as quiz name, specific scores, or custom fields to target specific audiences

- **Custom Actions**: Automate personalized follow-ups, like sending emails, SMS notifications, or assigning tasks based on quiz outcomes

- **Operational Efficiency:** Remove manual exports and spreadsheet work—scores flow directly into your automations

- **Scalable Workflows:** Combine with conditional steps, wait times and IF/ELSE logic to build complex nurture sequences effortlessly

* * *

## **Filters Options**

Filters tell HighLevel when the trigger should fire, giving you fine‑grained control over which quiz submissions activate a workflow. Advanced filters let you configure precise conditions, such as quiz name, overall or category score thresholds, or custom fields, so you can target specific audiences and decide exactly when the trigger activates.

Below is a breakdown of each available filter type:

- **Quiz Name:** Select a specific quiz, use Any to include all quizzes or use Is Not to rule out specific quizzes

- **Overall Score:** Create rules such as is greater than 80 or between 50 and 70 to segment by total score

- **Category Score:** Target learners who excelled (or struggled) in a particular section

- **Custom Field:** Reference custom score fields you created when designing your quiz

* * *

## **Use Case Examples**

- **Personalized Feedback for Learners:** Automatically send feedback emails to students based on their quiz scores, helping them improve their learning experience.

- **Lead Scoring and Segmentation:** Segment quiz takers into different categories based on scores and update CRM records accordingly for targeted marketing campaigns.

- **Course or Product Recommendations:** Suggest relevant courses or products to users based on their quiz performance, increasing engagement and conversions.

- **Automated Follow-Ups for Sales Teams:** Assign high-scoring quiz takers to the sales team for personalized outreach and follow-ups.

- **Event Participation Tracking:** Trigger an action to send event certificates or rewards based on quiz completion and score thresholds.

* * *

## **How To Setup Quiz Submitted Trigger**

- **Conditional Filtering:** Apply conditions such as quiz name, score thresholds, or category-based scores
