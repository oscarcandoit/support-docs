# Cloning Certificate Templates Across Locations

Modified on: Thu, 27 Feb, 2025 at 10:06 AM

## **Overview**

Users can now clone certificate templates from one location to another, making it easier to replicate and reuse designs. This feature allows cloning for up to **three locations at a time** while ensuring all associated elements are transferred seamlessly.

### **Key Highlights:**

✔ Clone certificate templates across multiple locations (up to 3 at a time).

✔ Automatically migrates all media files and images associated with the template.

✔ Retains all template configurations and version history.

✔ Option to clone within the same location as well.

## **How to Clone a Certificate Template**

1. **Navigate to:**

   - Go to **Memberships** \> **Certificates**.
2. **Initiate Cloning:**

   - Click on the **three-dots (⋮)** next to the template you want to clone.
   - Select **Clone** from the menu.
3. **Configure Cloning Settings:**

   - **Edit the Template Name** (if needed).
   - **Select the locations** where you want to clone the template (up to 3 locations).
4. **Complete the Process:**

   - Confirm your selection, and the system will replicate the template along with all media files, configurations, and version history.

**Note:**

You can also **clone a certificate template within the same location** if needed.
