#### **What You Need to Do**

Claim and verify your Google Business Profile, define your service areas, and integrate call tracking and automated review strategies to boost your local search ranking.

- **Claim & Verify Your Google Business Profile (GMB):** If you haven’t done this, you may be invisible to potential customers. Follow our [Google Business Profile setup guide](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177?hl=en) to get started.

- **Set Up Service Areas:** List all the cities and neighborhoods you serve to appear in local search results.
