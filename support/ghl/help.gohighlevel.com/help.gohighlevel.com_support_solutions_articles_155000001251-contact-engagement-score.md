# Contact Engagement score

Modified on: Wed, 5 Mar, 2025 at 6:07 AM

The Contact Engagement Score is a metric that helps businesses track, prioritize, and engage with leads based on their level of interaction. By assigning scores to actions like email opens, form submissions, and purchases, businesses can focus on high-score leads ready for conversion while nurturing low-score leads to improve engagement. In this article, you’ll learn how to set up engagement scoring, where to view scores in the platform.

# **What is Contact Engagement Score?**

The Contact Engagement Score is a numerical value that tracks how actively a contact interacts with a business. Each interaction impacts the score based on predefined rules. Positive actions like link clicks or payments increase the score, while negative actions like email bounces or unsubscribes reduce it. This ensures the score accurately reflects a contact’s engagement level.

By assigning points to actions like email opens, form submissions, and purchases, businesses can prioritize high-value leads while identifying those needing more nurturing.

* * *

## **Where to View Contact Engagement Scores**

Users can access engagement scores in different sections of the platform to quickly gauge a contact’s level of interaction. Below are the two primary locations where these scores can be found.

### **Contacts Section**

Inside an individual contact’s profile within the Contacts section, you need to scroll down to find the Contact Engagement Score dropdown among other details.

### **Conversations Section**

In the Conversations section, you can see the engagement score of the contact you are actively communicating with. As shown in the screenshot, the score can be viewed and edited from the "Contact Enagement Score" dropdown at the right hand side.

## **Understanding Action Types in Engagement Score Rules**

When setting up a new engagement score rule in Manage Score, you have multiple options as an action type that determines when the rule is triggered. Below is a breakdown of all available action types and how they can be used to track engagement effectively.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042671926/original/O_nqauhVV0ITGnbTG6LrClmuqtCkhJOZQw.gif?1741163161)

**Email Events:** When a contact interacts with an email, like opening it or clicking a link, their engagement score can increase, making it easier to track who is actively engaging with your emails and who might be interested in your offers.

**Contact Changed:** If a contact’s details change, such as when a custom field is updated, their engagement score can be adjusted accordingly, helping businesses track engagement based on profile updates, like when a lead moves from “New” to “Qualified.”

**Contact Tag:** Adding or removing a contact tag can also impact the engagement score, so if a contact is tagged as a “VIP Customer”, they might receive additional points, allowing businesses to prioritize engaged and high-value customers.

**Payment Received:** Whenever a payment is received, engagement points can be added to reflect a higher level of interaction, making it easy to differentiate between leads who are just browsing and those who have made a purchase.

**Contact Replied:** If a contact replies to a message, whether it’s an email, SMS, or chat, their engagement score can increase, helping businesses identify which contacts are actively responding and are more likely to convert.

**Form Submitted:** Submitting a form, like a lead generation or contact request form, can add points to a contact’s engagement score, allowing businesses to track which leads are showing strong interest and may need a follow-up.

**Order Form Submission:** When a contact submits an order form, it’s a sign that they are interested in making a purchase, so adding engagement points can help businesses identify sales-ready leads.

**Order Placed:** If a contact places an order, their engagement score can increase, making it easy to track customers who have gone beyond interest and taken action by purchasing a product or service.

**Survey Submitted:** Submitting a survey can also be a sign of engagement, so awarding points when a contact provides feedback helps recognize those who are actively participating and providing valuable insights.

**Trigger Link Clicked:** Clicking on a trigger link, such as a promotional or special offer link, shows interest in specific content, so adding points can help track contacts who engage with key calls to action.

**Appointment Booked:** When a contact books an appointment, like scheduling a demo or consultation, it’s a strong sign of intent, so increasing their engagement score can help businesses prioritize follow-ups with contacts who are ready to take the next step.

**Appointment Status Changed:** Appointment status changes, such as confirmations or cancellations, can also affect engagement scores, helping businesses track which contacts follow through on scheduled meetings and which ones might need a reminder or re-engagement.

## **How to Set Up and Manage Score**

Score rules define how points are assigned based on contact interactions, helping businesses measure engagement effectively. In this section, you’ll learn how to create, customize, and manage score rules. Keeping these rules updated ensures that engagement tracking stays accurate and useful.

**Access Manage Scoring Menu**

To get started, head over to Settings > Manage Scoring menu. This is where you’ll find all the existing scoring rules and have the flexibility to create new ones.

**Draft vs. Publish Toggle**

The Draft Mode allows you to make changes to engagement scoring rules without affecting live data. This is useful when setting up new rules or making adjustments before applying them to contacts. Once ready, switching to Publish Mode makes the score system active for all contacts, ensuring engagement tracking is updated in real-time.

**\+ Add New Rule Button**

Clicking the + Add New Rule button allows you to create custom engagement rules based on specific actions. This helps you tailor the engagement scoring to fit your needs by defining which interactions contribute to or reduce a contact’s score.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042676303/original/lfYFu5oHfIEtrtAxMa-8k9yV6c5KJv6fvg.gif?1741165444)

**Scoring Rules Table**

The Scoring Rules Table displays all existing engagement score rules, helping you track and modify your engagement tracking setup.

- **Action Column:** This column lists the conditions that trigger score adjustments, such as “if an email is opened” or “if a contact books an appointment.”
- **Calculation Column:** Shows how many points are added or subtracted based on the selected action.
- **Three-Dot Menu (⋮) for Each Rule:** Each rule includes a three-dot menu that allows users to edit or delete existing rules. This ensures flexibility in modifying scoring criteria as engagement strategies evolve.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can I apply different engagement score rules to different contact segments or lists?**

Yes, but not directly within the Manage Score section. Engagement scoring applies to all contacts globally. However, you can create smart lists or use tags and custom fields to segment contacts and apply engagement-based workflows that trigger different actions based on specific criteria.

**Q. Does the engagement score automatically decrease over time if a contact stops interacting?**

No, HighLevel’s engagement score does not include an automatic score decay feature. If you want scores to decrease for inactive contacts, you’ll need to set up an automation workflow using timed triggers that subtract points when a contact hasn’t interacted within a certain period (e.g., no email opens or replies in 60 days).

**Q. Can I assign different weightings to the same action based on different conditions?**

Currently, the Manage Score section does not support condition-based weightings for the same action. However, you can create multiple rules for similar actions with different triggers. For example, you can assign +5 points for clicking a regular email link but +10 points for clicking a high-priority promotional link using different trigger conditions.

**Q. How does the engagement score affect automated workflows, and can I trigger multiple workflows based on score changes?**

Yes! Engagement scores can be used as workflow triggers in the Automations section. You can create workflows that launch when a contact’s score crosses a threshold (e.g., greater than 20) to trigger sales outreach, email sequences, or nurture campaigns. Multiple workflows can be triggered based on different score levels to automate lead qualification and engagement strategies.

**Q. Can I track historical engagement score changes to see how a contact’s engagement evolves over time?**

Currently, HighLevel does not provide a built-in historical log for engagement score changes. However, you can work around this by logging engagement score changes in a custom field or using an automation workflow to store score snapshots at regular intervals. This allows you to track engagement trends and analyze how a contact’s interaction level changes over time.
