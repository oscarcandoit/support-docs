# Add-ons in Services

Modified on: Thu, 11 Sep, 2025 at 3:37 PM

# **What are Add-ons?**

Add Ons allow users to enhance services by offering additional features or upsells, providing customers with options to customize their booking experience. These add ons can be supplementary services or products related to the main service. For example:

- A spa might offer an "Aromatherapy Upgrade" that can be added to a massage session.

- A personal trainer could offer "Nutritional Consultation" as an extra option to a workout plan.

- A photographer might include "Additional Edited Photos" as an add on to a photoshoot package.

These offerings can increase revenue and enhance customer satisfaction by giving clients more personalized service options during the booking process.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Add-ons**

- **Upsell Revenue:** Offer upgrades at the moment of booking so more revenue is captured without extra follow-up

- **Personalized Bookings:** Customers choose relevant extras, leading to services that fit their needs and expectations

- **Transparent Pricing at Checkout:** Quantity-based pricing calculates the exact cost based on the services the customer selects

- **Service-Specific Relevance:** Add-ons appear only on services they’re assigned to, keeping choices focused

- **Faster Setup Across Offerings:** Create add-ons once and assign them wherever they apply, avoiding duplicate work.


* * *

## **Where to Create Add-ons**

You can access add-ons in two places:

- **From the Add-ons Tab:** Centralized list of all add-ons across services

- **Directly from a Service:** Add-ons created here are automatically added to that specific service.

* * *

## **Assigning Add Ons to Services**

Creating an add-on doesn’t make it available everywhere. Assign add-ons to each service where you want them to appear so customers see relevant options during booking.

- Add-ons can be linked to one or more services

- Add-ons will only appear on the booking page for the services they are linked to

- Customers see the add-on as an optional extra during booking


#### **Step 1:** Open Service Editor

- Navigate to the Services Panel ( **Calendar** \> **Calendar** **Settings** \> **Services**)

- Open the Service Editor for the service you would like to assign the add-on to ( **Three**- **dot** **(⋮)** \> **Edit**)

#### **Step 3:** Select Add-ons

## **How to Create Add-ons**

Proper setup ensures add-ons display with the right time, price, and visibility. Follow these steps to create a new add-on:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to + New Add-on

- Navigate to the Services Panel ( **Calendar** \> **Calendar** **Settings** \> **Services**)

- Open the **Add-ons** tab from the secondary navigation ribbon on the top

- Click the **\+ New Add-on** button in the upper right corner

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053202073/original/f2kcOphbYDDXyc48UieKmKcgOp2HOPzBWw.png?1757104691)

#### **Step 2:** Fill in Add-on Details

- Fill in the details for the add-on. These details include:




  - **Add-on Image:** Upload an image to represent the add-on visually

  - **Name:** Enter a clear name (e.g., _Lavender Massage Oil_)

  - **Price:** Set the cost of the add-on

  - **Duration:** Check the box if your add-on has its own duration. When enabled, this duration will be included in the total service time for customers

  - **Maximum Quantity:** Define how many units can be selected per appointment

  - **Multiple Price with Quantity:** If enabled, price is multiplied by the number of units (e.g., $20 × 2 qty = $40)

  - **Description:** Add details to explain the value of the add-on

  - **Hide from Booking Page:** Keep the add-on internal, so only staff can apply it
- Once all details have been added, click the **Create Add-on** button to save


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053202224/original/D3sjENtj0hBWuSPbchoBBUEr6xVkcfIQpA.png?1757105067)

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- Use clear names and images so customers instantly understand the add-on

- Limit maximum quantities when tied to physical stock (e.g., products, consumables)

- Bundle popular add-ons with services to increase upsell opportunities

- Use hidden add-ons for staff-only internal adjustments

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do add-ons automatically appear for all services?**

No. Add-ons must be manually assigned to each service where you want them available.

**Q: Will an add-on’s duration change the total service time?**

Yes. When Duration is enabled for add-ons, that time is added on top of the service duration to calculate the new in the overall service time.
