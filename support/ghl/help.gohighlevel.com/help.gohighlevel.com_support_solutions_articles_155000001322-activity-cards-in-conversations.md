# **What are Activity Cards?**

Activity Cards provide real-time updates on key interactions within the platform, eliminating the need to switch between different sections. Whether a new opportunity is created, an appointment is rescheduled, or an invoice is sent, these cards keep your team informed and allow instant access to relevant actions with just a click.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Activity Cards**

- **Real-Time Notifications:** Instantly view important updates about client interactions.

- **Seamless Workflow Management:** Edit and manage opportunities, appointments, DND status, and invoices without navigating away from conversations.

- **Enhanced Team Collaboration:** Ensures that all team members stay aligned on critical updates.

- **Faster Decision-Making:** Access necessary actions within a few clicks, improving response time and efficiency.

* * *

## **Where Do Activity Cards Appear?**

Activity Cards appear directly in the Conversations Panel, ensuring that you receive relevant updates in real-time. Instead of manually checking different sections of the platform, you can monitor and respond to important changes directly within your ongoing conversations. This feature enhances visibility and allows teams to manage client interactions more effectively.

## **Different Types of Activity Cards**

### **Opportunities**

Activity Cards related to opportunities appear whenever a new opportunity is created, updated, or deleted. This ensures that you stay informed about potential leads right from the beginning. Clicking 'View Opportunity' on the card allows you to make real-time modifications without leaving the conversation panel.

#### **View Opportunity**

When you click **“View Opportunity”** on the Activity Card, a detailed Opportunity Edit Panel opens as a pop-up window, providing access to all relevant opportunity details. This panel allows you to review, modify, and manage opportunity-related information without navigating away from the conversation panel.

Inside the Opportunity Edit Panel, you can:

- **View and Update Contact Information:** Edit the primary contact’s name, email, and phone number associated with the opportunity.
- **Modify Pipeline and Stage Information:** Quickly adjust the pipeline and opportunity stage to reflect progress.
- **Update Status and Opportunity Value:** Change the status of the opportunity (e.g., Open, Won, Lost) and update the deal value.
- **Manage Linked Tasks and Appointments:** Access and modify any tasks or scheduled appointments linked to the opportunity.
- **Check Audit Logs and Assigned Users:** Review ownership details, modification history, and user assignments for better tracking.

After making the necessary updates, just click the **“Update”** button at the bottom so the changes are saved.

### **Appointments**

Whenever an appointment is created, rescheduled, or canceled, an Activity Card appears in the conversation panel. This ensures that you are able to track appointment status without switching screens. Clicking 'View Appointment' lets you edit details directly within the conversation panel.

#### **View Appointment**

When you click **“View Appointment”** in the Activity Card, a detailed appointment panel opens right within the conversation screen—no need to navigate away. This panel gives you full control over appointment details, allowing you to review, update, and manage everything in one place. Here’s what you can do inside the View Appointment panel:

- **Get a Quick Overview:** Instantly see the appointment title, date, and time so you know exactly when and what the appointment is for.
- **Check Who’s Involved:** See the assigned team member handling the appointment and the primary contact associated with it.
- **Access Meeting Links & Calendar Info:** If the appointment is virtual, you’ll find a direct meeting link to join instantly. Plus, you can check which calendar it’s linked to for better scheduling.
- **Know Where the Appointment Was Created:** Whether it was booked through a conversation, a funnel, or manually added, you’ll see the source of the booking along with who scheduled it.
- **Update Appointment Status:** Need to confirm, cancel, or reschedule? You can do it right here, ensuring your team and client stay in sync.

### **Do Not Disturb (DND)**

Activity Cards notify users when a contact is marked as Do Not Disturb (DND) or removed from the DND list. These notifications help maintain clarity on communication preferences, ensuring that users interact with contacts in the most appropriate manner.

### **Invoices**

When an invoice is sent to a contact or a payment is received, an Activity Card is displayed. Clicking 'View Invoice' seamlessly redirects you to a detailed view of the invoice, providing immediate access to payment status and transaction details.
