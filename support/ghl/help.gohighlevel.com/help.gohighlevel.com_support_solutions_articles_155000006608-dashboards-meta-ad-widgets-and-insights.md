# **What are Meta Ad Widgets?**

Meta Ad Widgets are ready-made, visual reporting blocks that pull metrics from a connected Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ad account into the Sub-Account Dashboard and Custom Reports. They eliminate manual exports so you can monitor paid‑traffic performance in the same workspace where you manage funnels, automations, and CRM data.

Understanding what Meta Ad Widgets are—and where they live—helps you centralize marketing and sales analytics. By viewing ad performance next to pipeline and revenue metrics, you can make faster, data‑driven decisions without bouncing between platforms.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Meta Ad Widgets**

Meta Ad Widgets are designed to simplify daily monitoring and speed up optimization. Use the benefits below to align dashboards to your goals and spot issues before they impact spend or results.

- **Single‑pane visibility:** View ad spend, conversions, reach, CTR, and more alongside sales and CRM KPIs.

- **Faster optimization:** Identify rising CPCs or falling efficiency early so you can adjust budgets or creative.

- **Campaign drill‑downs:** Table widgets rank campaigns by spend, purchases, clicks, or impressions for quick winners/losers analysis.

- **Trend tracking:** Line and bar charts reveal movement in cost‑per‑conversion, reach, and other metrics across any date range.

- **Custom themes & filters:** Match your brand theme and slice data by campaign, ad set, or date to tailor insights to each audience or client.


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Access**

Before adding widgets, confirm your plan access and connection status so data appears as expected.

- A **Meta ad account must be connected** in **Settings → Integrations → Facebook** (LeadConnector).

- Ensure **LeadConnector permissions** are granted for the Business Manager, ad account, and pages you intend to report on.

- **Dashboards & Reports access**: verify users have permission to view or edit dashboards and to create/schedule reports.


* * *

## **Meta Ad Performance Metrics**

These widgets visualize the core numbers advertisers use to gauge success. Pair spend-based metrics with outcome metrics to keep efficiency front and center.

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Website Purchases | Purchases completed on your website from users driven by social ads traffic. |
| Conversions | Actions attributed to your ads (e.g., purchases, sign-ups) as defined by your Meta setup. |
| Meta Ad Clicks | Total clicks on your Meta ads. |
| Amount Spent | Total ad spend in the selected date range. |
| Average CPC (Cost Per Click) | Average amount paid per click. |
| Cost Per Conversion | Average cost to generate one conversion. |
| Ad Impressions | Total number of times your ads were shown. |
| Reach | Unique users who saw your ads. |
| Average CPM (Cost Per Mille) | Average cost per 1,000 impressions. |
| CTR (Click-Through Rate) | Percentage of impressions that resulted in a click. |

* * *

## **Top Campaigns Widgets**

Table‑style widgets automatically rank campaigns so you can double‑down on what works.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Widget** | **Definition** |
| Top Campaigns by Ad Spend | Campaigns ranked by the highest advertising spend. |
| Top Campaigns by Conversions | Campaigns that drove the most conversions. |
| Top Campaigns by Website Purchases | Campaigns that resulted in the most website purchases. |
| Top Campaigns by Ad Clicks | Campaigns that generated the most clicks on ads. |
| Top Campaigns by Impressions | Campaigns with the highest number of ad impressions. |
| Top Campaigns by Reach | Campaigns that reached the most unique users. |

## **Dashboard Widgets vs. Custom Report Widgets**

Both environments use the same Meta metric library; choose based on how you need to consume and share insights.

- **Dashboard** — Best for at‑a‑glance monitoring throughout the day. Widgets live on a sub‑account dashboard and **update automatically**.

- **Custom Reports** — Best for scheduled email delivery and packaged insights. Build layouts with Meta Ad widgets, then schedule to stakeholders as needed. (Note: exported formats and email previews may differ based on content types.)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Do I need a separate Meta connection for every sub‑account?**

Yes. Each sub‑account dashboard pulls data only from the Meta ad account connected inside that sub‑account.

**Q. How often do Meta Ad Widgets refresh?**

Widgets **update automatically**; no manual refresh is required.

**Q. Why is my widget blank after I add it?**

Common causes include an overly narrow date range, restrictive campaign filters, no eligible ad account selected, or missing LeadConnector permissions. Remove filters, widen the range, and verify the connection.

**Q. Which roles can connect Meta and add widgets?**

Users need permission to manage **Ad Manager** connections and to **Edit** dashboards or **Create** reports. View‑only users can see shared dashboards but can’t modify them.

**Q. Can I combine Google Ads and Meta Ads metrics on the same dashboard?**

Yes. Add widgets from both libraries to compare channels side by side.

**Q. Can I schedule a Meta‑only report for clients?**

Yes. Build a report using only Meta widgets, then schedule email delivery. Confirm export and layout options meet the client’s needs.

**Q. Will disabling the Meta integration break my existing widgets?**

Widgets stop displaying data until you reconnect an eligible ad account, but your layout and widget settings remain in place.
