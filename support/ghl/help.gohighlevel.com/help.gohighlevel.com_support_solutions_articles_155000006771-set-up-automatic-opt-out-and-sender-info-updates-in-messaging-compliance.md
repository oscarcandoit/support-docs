# **What Is Auto Updating Opt-Out & Sender Info ?**

This feature is a built-in **compliance automation** that appends required **opt-out language** and **sender details** to your SMS/MMS conversations at regular intervals.

It ensures that ongoing conversations continue to meet standards set by **TCPA**, **CTIA**, **GDPR**, and **CCPA**, reducing the risk of regulatory penalties or message filtering.

Once configured, the system automatically refreshes compliance details such as “Reply STOP to unsubscribe” and your sender name without you having to manually add them to each conversation.

* * *

## **Key Benefits Auto Updating Opt-Out & Sender Info ?**

This automation is designed to simplify compliance and maintain healthy message deliverability across your campaigns.

- **Continuous Compliance:** Ensures required disclosures are periodically included in all active SMS/MMS threads.

- **Customizable Frequency:** Choose how often compliance details are refreshed — from 1 to 60 days (default: 30 days).

- **Effortless Automation:** Works in the background, reducing manual oversight and administrative time.

- **Higher Deliverability:** Keeps messages aligned with carrier and regulatory guidelines, minimizing spam filtering.

- **Improved Transparency:** Builds trust with recipients by maintaining clear sender identification and opt-out visibility.

### **Enable Periodic Opt-Out**

Periodic opt-out ensures ongoing conversations remain compliant by re-adding sender and opt-out details automatically after the selected interval.

This helps maintain regulatory adherence and message deliverability without manual updates.

1. Enable **Enable Periodic Opt-Out.**

2. In the field **Include Sender ID & Opt-Out Message Every \[X\] Days**, choose your preferred interval between **1–60 days** (default: 30).

3. Click **Save** to activate.

### **Apply Regional Restrictions**

Optionally, enable the setting **Block any SMS/MMS to Texas recipients or from Texas area-code numbers** if applicable to your region.

This ensures compliance with state-specific messaging regulations.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Does this automation update previous conversations?**

No. The automation applies only to **new and ongoing** conversations. Past messages remain unchanged.

**Q. How does the system determine when to re-add opt-out information?**

The automation uses the **frequency interval** you set (for example, every 30 days).

It automatically tracks message threads and refreshes compliance information once the interval elapses.

**Q. Can I disable this feature if I handle compliance manually?**

While the automation is integrated for consistent protection, you can adjust the frequency to a longer interval or disable it temporarily by unchecking the **Enable Periodic Opt-Out** box.

**Q. How does this feature affect message deliverability and carrier filtering?**

Carriers often filter or block messages missing proper sender or opt-out details.

By keeping your messages compliant and updated, this feature helps maintain higher delivery rates and prevents carrier penalties or message suppression.
