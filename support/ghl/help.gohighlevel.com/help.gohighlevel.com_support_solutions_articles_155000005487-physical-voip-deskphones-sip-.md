**Step 4:** Assign User

Each VoIP deskphone needs to be connected to a user in your sub-account. Select one user from the Assign to User dropdown.

Make sure the user's individual phone settings are configured to use deskphone. Navigate to **Settings > My Staff > Choose staff > Edit > Call & Voicemail Settings**, please enable "Deskphone" for the options you need. Enable it for "Forward Calls to" to receive calls addressed to you on the Deskphone. If you're receiving calls as part of "Ring multiple", and you want to receive them on the deskphone, enable Deskphone under "Ring all".

**Step 5:** Configure the Physical Phone

- Enter the SIP Domain, Username, and Password into the phone’s **Registrar / Server / Proxy** fields (varies by phone model and manufacturer).


**Step 6:** Run the Built-In Test Calls (Optional)

- **Navigate** to VoiP Deskphone (SIP) > Test Calls > Simulate Calls.

- **Outbound test** – Dial the displayed number; you should hear “This is a test call” three times if successful.

- **Inbound test** – Click _Inbound Test Call_; the deskphone should ring.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Which VoIP deskphones are compatible?**

Most open-SIP models—see the recommended list above.

****Q:** Can I record and transcribe every call?**

Yes. Once enabled, all calls are automatically recorded and transcribed.

****Q:** How do I perform a blind transfer during a call?**

Use the **Blind Transfer** option on your deskphone UI.

****Q:** Is there an extra charge for using deskphones?**

No. Deskphone calls share the same per-minute rates as web/mobile calls. There is no additional cost for the call transfer to a deskphone.

****Q:** Can two deskphones point at the same HighLevel user?**

No, you can only connect a single user to each VoIP deskphone.

****Q:** Do you support SIP Trunking?**

No, we do not support SIP Trunking as of now. So you cannot connect your existing PBX/Asterix to GHL as of now.

****Q:** Why am I not able to receive the incoming call on my deskphone?**

Make sure the user's individual phone settings are deskphone. Navigate to **Settings > My Staff > Choose staff > Edit > Call & Voicemail Settings**, please enable **"Deskphone"** for the options you need.

**Q: Can I place callers on hold with music from a deskphone?**

Music played during a _handset_ Hold depends on your SIP phone model and its local Hold behavior. HighLevel does **not** control music-on-hold triggered by a device’s Hold button. If you want callers to hear audio while they wait _inside a call flow_, use an **IVR** step with an audio prompt in your workflow.

See **_[Interactive Voice Response (IVR)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001200)_** for more information.

**Q: Can I transfer a call to another user’s extension from a deskphone? Are extensions visible on the phone?**

Yes—supported SIP handsets can perform a **blind transfer** to another user’s extension. **Warm transfer** is **not** supported as of now. Showing other users/extensions on the deskphone screen is not supported as of now.

For assisted transfers on the web, see **_[Outbound Calls with the Web Dialer](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000981431)_**.

**Q: Can I check HighLevel voicemail from the deskphone’s voicemail button?**

Voicemails that route to HighLevel are reviewed in **Conversations** and in **Reporting → Call Reporting**. A phone’s native voicemail feature (if present) is separate and does **not** access HighLevel voicemail.

See _[**Voicemail for Company and for Users**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001146671)_ for more information.

**Q: Is there a single place to review all call recordings?**

Yes. Use **Reporting → Call Reporting** for a consolidated list of calls and recordings. You can also open recordings from each contact’s **Conversations** thread. IVR-connected calls may include multiple recordings for different call legs.

**Q: Are there known compatibility issues with certain SIP deskphones?**

Most open-SIP phones work when standard SIP registration is supported. Ensure network prerequisites are met (e.g., disable SIP ALG; allow SIP/RTP). If you’re unsure, share your handset **make/model and firmware** so we can point you to the best approach.

**Q: Do you have configuration blueprints or model-specific setup guides?**

Follow the steps in this article to create the SIP user/extension, then enter those credentials in your phone’s SIP account fields (commonly: **SIP URI**, **Username/Extension**, **Authentication/Password**). If you provide your phone model, we can share the most relevant instructions.
