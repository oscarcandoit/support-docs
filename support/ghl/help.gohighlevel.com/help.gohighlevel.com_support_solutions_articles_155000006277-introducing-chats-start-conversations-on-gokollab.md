# **What is GoKollab Chats?**

Chats is GoKollab’s built-in direct messaging experience for members who share a community. It keeps collaboration close to where discussion and learning happen so you can move from a public thread to a focused conversation when needed.

Chats allows you to start a private conversation with another member directly from your community discussion page. Messages live inside GoKollab, helping you keep context, continuity, and momentum across your work.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of using GoKollab Chats**

These benefits focus on speed, context, and simplicity—helping members stay engaged and organized while reducing the need for external messaging tools.

- **Direct messaging:** Start one-to-one conversations with members who share your community.

- **Centralized inbox:** View and manage all conversations in a single place.

- **Searchable history:** Find past conversations quickly when you need to reference decisions or details.

- **In-app notifications:** Get notified inside GoKollab when a new message arrives so you can respond promptly.

- **Context preserved:** Begin a chat from the community discussion page to keep conversations tied to where collaboration started.

- **Simple and intuitive:** Lightweight, approachable design that’s easy for any member to use.

## **In-Platform Messaging**

Starting conversations from within the community keeps work in context and encourages timely, focused collaboration.

- Move from a public post to a private exchange without leaving GoKollab.

- See all your ongoing chats **in one place**.

- For broader community concepts, roles, and member management, see **[How to Setup, Customize, and Manage Your Communities](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000280-how-to-setup-customize-and-manage-your-communities?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** and **[How to Manage Members Inside Groups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000289-how-to-manage-members-inside-groups?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**

## **Privacy & Safety**

Clear boundaries between product areas help members choose the right messaging tool and avoid confusion.

- **GoKollab Chats vs. Internal Chat:** GoKollab Chats are **member-to-member** messages in communities. Internal Chat is **team communication** inside your HighLevel account. See **[Internal Chat: Private Team Communication](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004686-internal-chat-private-team-communication)**

- **GoKollab Chats vs. Chat Widget:** The Chat Widget is a website widget for lead/customer messaging—not member DMs. See **[Chat Widget Integration with the Client Portal](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005913-chat-widget-integration-with-the-client-portal)**

- Direct messages are designed for participant-to-participant communication within your shared community. For workspace policies or compliance needs, check with your workspace admin.
