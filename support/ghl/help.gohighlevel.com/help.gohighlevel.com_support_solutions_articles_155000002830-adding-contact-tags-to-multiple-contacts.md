## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I apply multiple tags at once to a contact?**

Yes, you can select and apply multiple tags simultaneously in a single bulk action. Simply add all desired tags in the Tags field before submitting the action.

**Q: Will this overwrite existing tags on the contact?**

No, adding tags in bulk will only append the selected tags to the contact’s existing tag list. It will not remove any pre-existing tags.

**Q: Can I use tags to trigger automations?**

Absolutely. Tags are commonly used as workflow triggers within HighLevel automations, allowing you to launch sequences when a tag is applied or removed.

**Q: How do I undo or remove tags applied in bulk?**

To remove tags from contacts, use the “Remove Tag” bulk action. You can either remove specific tags or clear all tags from selected contacts. This will be covered in a separate article.

**Q: Can I see which contacts were successfully tagged?**

Yes. Go to the Bulk Actions tab and click on “Show Stats” beside the relevant action. This view shows the success status, contact identifiers, and timestamps for each tagged record.
