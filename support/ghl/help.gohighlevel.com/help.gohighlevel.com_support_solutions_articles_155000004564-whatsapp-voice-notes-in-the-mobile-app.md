We're thrilled to announce our latest update to Mobile app - the ability to record and send voice notes using WhatsApp as a channel on Conversations. This update is available on HighLevel, Leadconnector, and Whitelabelled apps (update needs to be requested).

## **What's New:**

- Record voice note - You can start recording a new voice note by tapping on the voice note icon
- Pause and Delete: You can pause and resume the voice note that you are recording. You can even delete the existing voice recording and start a new one
- Send voice notes: You can send the voice note inside the conversation

## **How It Works:**

1. Open the mobile app with your preferred subaccount.
2. Navigate to the conversations section and select an ongoing whatsapp chat.
3. You will now be able to see an icon next to the text field to record a voice note
4. You can record a voice note, pause and resume it, or delete it
5. Once you have recorded your voice note, tap on the send icon to send the voice note. And you're all set!
