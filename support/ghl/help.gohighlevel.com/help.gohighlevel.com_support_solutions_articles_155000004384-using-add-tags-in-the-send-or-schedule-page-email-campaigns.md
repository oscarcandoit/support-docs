## **What is the Add Tags in the Send or Schedule Page Feature?**

The Create New Tags in the Send or Schedule Page feature allows users to generate new contact tags on-the-fly while scheduling or sending email campaigns in HighLevel. Tags are used to segment contacts, trigger automations, and organize campaign recipients. Previously, tags had to be created in advance from the Contacts or Tags section, but now you can add them instantly during campaign setup, making the process faster and more intuitive.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Adding Tags on the Send or Schedule Page**

Unlock greater efficiency and flexibility in your email marketing by using this feature:

- Instantly create and apply new tags without leaving the campaign workflow.

- Eliminate the need to pre-plan or pre-create tags in the Contacts section.

- Streamline automation setup by tagging contacts as you schedule or send emails.

- Reduce context switching and save time during campaign creation.

- Improve campaign organization and segmentation with real-time tag management.

## **How To Add Tags in the Send or Schedule Page**

Setting up and using this feature is simple and ensures your campaigns are organized and automated efficiently. Follow these steps to create and apply new tags during the email campaign scheduling process:

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Email Marketing

Under Email Campaigns, start a new email campaign or open an existing one you wish to edit.

### **Step 2:** Proceed to the Send or Schedule

### **Step 3:** Enable the Automate option to Add Tags

Click on **Add Tags** and toggle it to enable tag assignment. This allows you to add tags depending on the contact’s interaction with the campaign

```
IMPORTANT: If you wish to add a new tag which is not created previously in the CRM, just type in the New Tag Name. For example: I wish to add a tag called as "Adit_test", which is a new tag, hence I would be simply typing in "Adit_test" to add this new tag.
```

### **Step 4:** View Tags in Stats

After sending, go to the "Campaign Stats" page and click "Tags" to see your tag summary.
