# Where Do Form Responses Show Up?

Modified on: Fri, 5 Apr, 2024 at 6:17 PM

Forms will help you capture information about contacts that fill out and submit the form. In order to view this information, start by navigating to "Sites" > "Forms" (at the top of the screen) > "Submissions"  where, you will be able to filter or search through form submissions and view the information that was provided on a particular form submission.

```
If you are using custom fields on your forms, those will also be shown in the Contact Details page which you can access by navigating to "Contacts" > (then search or click on any Contact).

how come the contact doesnt get created in the my database after form is filled out?

This will make a huge mess for anyone that wants to run more than one survey per client in their life time
