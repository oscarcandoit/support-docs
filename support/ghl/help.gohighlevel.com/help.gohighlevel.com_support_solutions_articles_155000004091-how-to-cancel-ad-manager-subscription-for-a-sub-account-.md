## **Where to find Ad Manager subscription details in a sub-account?**

Ad Manager subscription details can be found under Ad Manager settings by clicking on the gear icon present on top right of Ad Manager home screen.

A dedicated "Subscription" tab is present along with other tabs under Ad Manager settings:

The relevant details pertaining to your Ad Manager subscription like, monthly charges and subscription ID are specified with an option to cancel the subscription.

## **How do I cancel my Ad Manager subscription?**

Under Ad Manager settings > Subscription tab, the subscription details are mentioned with an ellipses(three dots) at the end of the row. On click of the ellipses, we get an option to cancel the subscription:

On click of the 'Cancel Subscription' button, a dialog opens up to show important information to the user as to what will happen if they choose to proceed, which is as follows:

1. All active ad campaigns that are published using your Ad Manager will be paused.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Lead syncing for lead generation ad campaigns created on Ad Manager will stop.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Any connected ad accounts will be disconnected, and you won't have access to Ad Manager until the subscription is renewed.

In the above dialog, select a reason to cancel the subscription from the given options or choose 'Other' and specify your specific reason to do so.

Post reason selection, the 'Cancel Subscription' button gets activated and on click of the same, your active Ad Manager subscription gets canceled and a dialog confirming the same gets shown.

## **What to do if your location subscription is not canceled?**

In case your location subscription is not canceled and you see a failure message as shown below:

Although rare, but in cases such as these, reach out to support by creating a ticket and getting it canceled by asking the support rep to do the needful for you.

In cases when user has published a campaign and it is undergoing review by the publishing platform, you will not be allowed to unsubscribe or cancel your subscription and an error dialog specifying the same message will be shown.
