# Launch Paid Ads That Actually Fill Dental Chairs

Modified on: Sun, 18 May, 2025 at 7:41 AM

Running ads isn’t the problem. Making them work—that’s where most dental clinics fall short. Generic ads. Vague offers. Traffic sent to a homepage that doesn’t convert. Leads collected but never contacted. It’s not a marketing problem—it’s a **system problem**.

That’s where GoHighLevel (GHL) becomes a game-changer. It doesn’t just help you run ads—it gives you the tools to turn ad clicks into scheduled patients automatically. And with the right ad strategy, your practice can become the go-to clinic in your area without wasting a dollar.

### **Why Most Dental Ads Underperform**

Here’s what many dental practices are doing (and why it’s not working):

- Sending ad traffic to a cluttered homepage with no clear CTA

- Promoting generic messaging like “We’re Accepting New Patients”

- Offering no urgency, no hook, and no incentive to act now

- Collecting leads in spreadsheets or email inboxes without follow-up


What actually works is a structured system that integrates **offer, funnel, follow-up, and tracking**—all in one place.

GHL does this seamlessly.

**[Getting Started - Launch A Funnel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005057-getting-started-launch-a-funnel)**

* * *

### **Step 1: Craft a High-Conversion Dental Offer**

Good ads start with a great offer. And in dental, the offer is everything. It should be specific, time-sensitive, and easy to act on.

**Winning Offers You Can Run Today:**

- $79 New Patient Special: Exam, X-rays, and Cleaning

- Free Whitening Kit with First Appointment

- $500 Off Invisalign This Month Only

- Free Dental Implant Consultation + 3D Scan


> Tip: Set up a “New Patient Offer Funnel” using one of our prebuilt templates. Your offer, landing page, and follow-up sequence—ready in under an hour.

**[Check out Template Library Overview & Setup](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001236650-template-library-overview-setup)**

* * *

### **Step 2: Choose the Right Platform (And Know What to Expect)**

There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to dental ads. But here’s a quick breakdown:

**Google Ads**

- Best for high-intent search traffic (e.g., “emergency dentist near me”)

- Excellent for urgent care, implants, and cosmetic dentistry

- Costs more per click, but typically higher ROI per booking


**Facebook & Instagram Ads**

- Great for local awareness and offer-driven campaigns

- Ideal for new patient specials, whitening, Invisalign

- Lower cost per lead, more nurturing required


> Tip: Use attribution reporting in GHL to track which leads and bookings came from each platform.

**[Understanding Attribution Source (Ad Reporting)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001219997-understanding-attribution-source-ad-reporting-)**

* * *

### **Step 3: Send Traffic to a Funnel (Not Your Website)**

Most websites are designed to educate. Funnels are designed to convert.

Your ad traffic should go to a single, focused funnel built inside GHL. It should include:

- Headline that calls out the exact problem or service (e.g., "Back-to-School Cleanings — Limited Spots")

- The offer details and benefits

- Trust elements: photos, reviews, “Doctor-owned” statements

- Short, mobile-friendly form (Name, Phone, Email)

- Embedded calendar for instant booking (syncs with your GHL calendar)


**[Understand Funnel Paths](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000980321-funnel-paths)**

* * *

### **Step 4: Create Ads That Stop the Scroll (and Prompt Action)**

You don’t need fancy design. You need clarity, confidence, and a reason to click.

**Example – New Patient Facebook Ad** Headline: "New to \[City\]? Smile With Confidence." Body: "For a limited time, get a full exam, X-rays, and cleaning for just $79. Perfect for new patients looking for expert care and a friendly team. Limited availability." CTA: Book Now (links to GHL funnel)

**Example – Google Ad for Implants** Headline: "Dental Implants in \[City\] \| Free 3D Consultation" Body: "Restore your smile with permanent, natural-looking implants. Financing available. Book online now." CTA: Schedule Appointment (tracks back to GHL)

> Tip: Use the Social Media Lead Ads + GHL integration to send leads directly into your CRM, triggering your workflows instantly.

**[Facebook Multi Page Lead Ads Integration](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004537-facebook-multi-page-lead-ads-integration)**

* * *

### **Step 5: Automate Your Follow-Up (This Is Where GHL Wins)**

Every time someone fills out a form, the clock is ticking. You need to follow up fast—and consistently.

In GoHighLevel, you can:

- Trigger an SMS the second a lead submits the form

- Send an email confirmation with booking instructions

- Add them to a nurture sequence if they don’t book right away

- Use AI chatbots to qualify and engage leads 24/7

- Notify your front desk when a lead replies, clicks, or books


> Clinics that respond within 5 minutes see up to 10x more bookings than those that wait a day.

**[Automatic Email and SMS Followup](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005060-getting-started-automatic-email-and-sms-followup)**

* * *

### **Step 6: Measure Every Dollar (And Optimize It)**

With GHL’s attribution and pipeline tools, you don’t have to wonder if your ads are working.

Track:

- Cost per lead (CPL) by platform and campaign

- Show rate and conversion rate by funnel

- Lifetime value (LTV) of each ad-sourced patient

- ROI of every offer over time


> GHL Bonus: Use the built-in dashboard to run weekly ad performance reviews—no spreadsheets needed.

### **Sample Dental Ad Campaigns That Convert**

| Campaign Type | Who It's For | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New Patient Special | General family dentistry | High-volume, easy to scale |
| Invisalign Offer | Ortho/cosmetic focused clinics | Big-ticket, aspirational, repeat visits |
| Emergency Services | Practices offering urgent care | Captures high-intent, ready-to-book |
| Implants + Financing | Clinics with high LTV procedures | Qualified leads, strong ROI |

* * *

### **Final Thoughts**

Running ads doesn’t have to feel like gambling. With the right strategy and the right system behind it, your ad spend becomes a reliable growth engine.

GoHighLevel doesn’t just help you build ads—it helps you turn strangers into leads, leads into appointments, and appointments into lifelong patients.

Start with one great offer. Build your funnel. Automate your follow-up. Track every step.

This is what smart dental marketing looks like in 2025.
