### **Custom Object Support in Snapshots**

You can now include custom objects and **all** their associated custom fields (not limited to primary fields) within snapshots. This enables you to effortlessly copy custom object data across multiple sub-accounts.

```
Custom Objects can only be copied between sub-accounts. Direct export of custom objects is not supported
```

* * *

### **Custom Object Associations**

Custom objects are automatically associated with other custom objects or contacts within the snapshot process. Associations are included by default and **cannot** be modified or deselected during snapshot creation.

```
Associations between custom objects and other objects (including contacts) will be automatically created or updated. You cannot manually edit these associations during the snapshot process.
```

* * *

### **How to Copy Custom Objects Between Sub-Accounts**

Follow these steps to copy custom object data:

1. Navigate to **Agency > Account Snapshots > Create Snapshot**.

2. Select the **custom object** you want to include in the snapshot.

3. The selected custom object’s fields and associations (to other custom objects or contacts) will automatically be included.

4. Choose the **source and target sub-accounts** to complete the snapshot transfer.


* * *

### **Important Limitations**

- **Custom Object Limit per Snapshot:**

A snapshot can contain a maximum of **10 custom objects** per sub-account. If importing the snapshot would exceed this limit, **no custom objects will be created** in the target sub-account.
