# Connect Google with Ad Manager

Modified on: Mon, 17 Feb, 2025 at 5:31 AM

As part of this article, we will be discussing the onboarding flow which includes connecting your Google account and the Ad account you want to use with Ad Manager to publish ad campaigns.

## **How to subscribe for Ad Manager?**

Irrespective of what plan agency has selected for Ad Manager reselling, the steps to be taken by a sub-account to subscribe are mentioned in the following article. Learn more about Agency pricing plans [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004261-how-to-enable-and-resell-ad-manager)

Agency can provide the user with necessary permissions to the staff team member by going to the Settings > Teams > edit the permission of specific team member, in the option of roles and permission there will be option to enable the checkbox of Ad Manager.

Once done, users can proceed to subscribe Ad Manager from agency by clicking on the 'Activate Ad Manager' button present under the specific Sub-Account ➝ Marketing ➝ Ad Manager tab.

When your client purchases Ad Manager it creates a subscription in the System which is between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients.

When your client clicks the Pay and Subscribe button the system will create the subscription, process the payment, and take them to the Ad Manager onboarding flow.

```
Note: This is a monthly subscription amount which agency charges from sub-accounts to use Ad Manager and publish unlimited campaigns. Payment for the campaign will be charged from the card on file under Meta Ad account, added by the user once campaign is approved by the ad publishing platform to be published.
```

If you wish to offer Ad Manager at a personalised amount for a specific amount or give it for free to one or multiple sub-accounts, refer this [help article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000004261?portalId=48000045315#Personalising-offers-for-certain-clients) to understand how that can be done.
