# New UI for Email creation via Bulk action in Contacts

Modified on: Sun, 12 Oct, 2025 at 11:48 PM

The updated **Bulk Email Action** lets you build, review, and send emails seamlessly with pre-send contacts filtering and advanced tracking tools.

## **Overview**

The Bulk Email Action in Contacts now has a unified, streamlined UI like Campaigns and Workflows. You can quickly create, review, and send emails with pre-send contact filtering, tracking, and template options, all in one place.

## **What’s New**

#### **Pre-send Contact Filtering**

Before sending, a confirmation modal now filters out:

- Invalid email addresses

- Unsubscribed bounced contacts


This ensures your email is only delivered to valid and opted-in recipients, giving you better deliverability and peace of mind.

#### **Unified Email Creation Flow**

All email builders in Bulk action, Workflows, and Campaigns now share the same UI and workflow.

You can start from:

- **Quick Compose (default)** → Simple editor for fast messages.

- **Smart Builder** → Choose Design, Code, or Plain Text editors to create custom emails.

- **Select Template** → Pick from My Templates or the Template Library.

#### **Advanced Settings**

Expand **Advanced Settings** to enable:

- **Link Tracking** → See clicks and CTR for every link.

- **UTM Parameters** → Add tracking tags for campaign analytics.

- **Add Tags** → Automatically tag contacts based on opens or clicks.

   - **Quick Compose** – Fast, simple emails.
