# **What is Payment Received Trigger?**

The Payment Received trigger allows you to initiate automated workflows when a payment is successfully made through your HighLevel account. This includes payments from funnels, invoices, calendars, memberships, forms, and even manual entries. Whether it’s a one-time transaction or a recurring subscription payment, this trigger lets you respond immediately—without lifting a finger.

This is an essential automation tool for reducing manual follow-up, confirming payments, and ensuring consistent communication with customers and internal teams.

## **Key Benefits of Payment Received Trigger**

### **Add Filters**

Click + Add filters to narrow down which payment events trigger this workflow. Filters allow you to target specific transaction types, sources, products, or statuses.

- **Source Filter:** Specify where the payment originated. This helps tailor automation based on the payment channel used.

- **Calendar:** Payment received from a calendar appointment booking.

- **External:** Payment made through third-party sources like Stripe, PayPal, or external API integrations.

- **Form:** Payment submitted through a form that includes a payment element.

- **Funnel:** Payment made through a funnel page, such as a one-step or two-step order form.

- **Invoice:** Payment completed via an invoice sent through HighLevel’s invoicing feature.

- **Manual Payment:** A payment recorded manually inside the CRM.

- **Memberships:** Payment triggered by access to a membership product or course.

- **Website:** Payment made through the e-commerce Storefront (Products or Subscriptions).

### **Choose Filter Criteria**

Select from available standard fields like Global Product, Payment Status, or Source. These filters help you target specific types of transactions for precise workflow control.

### **Filter by Product**

Choose Global Product as your filter type and select the specific product name. This ensures the workflow only triggers when a payment is received for that exact product.

### **Filter by Source**

Add the Source filter and set it to Calendar. This restricts the trigger to only activate for payments made through calendar-based bookings.

### **Specify Calendar**

Use the Calendar filter to select the exact calendar (e.g., “Pat’s Calendar”). This adds another layer of precision by tying the workflow to a specific booking calendar.

### **Save the Trigger**

Once all filters are applied, click Save Trigger to finalize your configuration. This locks in your criteria so the workflow only activates under the defined conditions.
