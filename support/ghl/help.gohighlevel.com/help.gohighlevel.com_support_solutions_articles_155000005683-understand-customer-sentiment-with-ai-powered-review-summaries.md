# **What are AI-Powered Review Summaries?**

The AI-Powered Review Summary is a smart, auto‑generated insight card that appears automatically for every user who has at least one connected review location. It rolls up feedback from all pages into a single-to-understand summary including a concise paragraph that explains overall sentiment, the most common themes and highlight tags (e.g., “great staff,” “slow service”). These summaries help save time, reveal trends instantly and are especially useful for multi-location businesses that track a high volume of reviews.

## **Key Benefits of AI-Powered Review Summaries**

Understanding precisely what customers love, or dislike, helps you refine products, coach teams, and protect your brand. These benefits ensure that feedback translates into measurable improvements.

- **Rapid Insights:** At‑a‑glance grasp of overall customer sentiment

- **Time Savings:** Eliminate manual review analysis and tagging

- **Auto‑Tagged Themes:** Quickly spot patterns like “great support” or “long wait”

- **Targeted Filters:** Slice data by source and date for precise insights


* * *

## **Where to Find AI-Powered Review Summaries**

You can access AI‑generated insights in two places inside Reputation: the Reviews tab and the Overview tab

**Overview** **Tab**: The purple **AI Summary** card appears on the right side of the page

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050260181/original/GgC2IJXhwnQKOPkXARVqDabLPdCk48PjsQ.png?1753208480)**

**Reviews** **Tab** **:** The purple **AI Summary** card appears on the left side of the page

* * *

## **Highlight Tags**

Each summary is accompanied by **highlight tags**, which are AI-generated keywords or short phrases that represent recurring themes in your reviews.

These include:

- Sentiment tags: “Great service,” “Rude staff,” “Fast response”

- Topic tags: “Booking system,” “Parking,” “Cleanliness”


These tags update dynamically based on your selected filters.

* * *

## **Filtering by Location & Time**

Filtering by **page source** and **date range** lets you isolate specific branches, campaigns, or timeframes, ensuring summaries reflect only the data you care about.

- **Location Filter:** Select one or more pages (locations) to narrow the summary

- **Date Filter:** Set a custom timeframe to view reviews and summaries from a specific period


To set filters, click the purple **AI Summary** button in the upper right corner of the Reviews tab.

* * *

## **Refreshing the Summary**

If you’ve added new reviews or changed filters, you can **refresh the AI summary** at any time:

1. Click the **Refresh icon** next to the summary title

2. The AI will regenerate the summary using the most current data and filters

3. Updated highlight tags and sentiment will appear automatically

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How often are summaries refreshed?**

Summaries update in real time whenever new reviews matching your filters arrive or you click the refresh button.

**Q: Is AI Summary the same as Reviews AI auto‑replies?**

No. Reviews AI generates replies, while AI Summary analyzes sentiment and themes.

**Q: Which review platforms are included in the summary?**

The AI analyzes every connected review page unless you filter the summary to specific sources. To check what pages are being included, go to the AI Summary filter.
