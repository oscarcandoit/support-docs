You can now assign Groups to the **Unassigned Calendar** type as well as other **Round-robin** Calendars

Go to **Settings> Calendars:**

Click on the **3 dots** on the right side of the desired Calendar and then click on **Move to Group**:

It would open a pop-up where you would be asked to select a group you want to assign to the calendar and then Click on **Select**
