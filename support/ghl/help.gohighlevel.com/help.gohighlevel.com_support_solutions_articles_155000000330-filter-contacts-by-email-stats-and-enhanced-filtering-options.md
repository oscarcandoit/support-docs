**Primary functions within this feature set:**

- Email Stat Filtering: Users have the ability to filter contacts based on specific email stats, including Sent, Delivered, Opened, Clicked, Complained, and Bounced. This feature allows users to target and analyze contacts based on their engagement levels, aiding in the optimization of email outreach.
- Date Level Filtering: Users can narrow down their contact list to a specific time frame, allowing for measurement of the impact of email campaigns and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Whether it's bulk email, campaign, or workflow, users can now select multiple campaigns or workflows to segment their contact list with precision. This feature offers a granular approach to tailoring messages to different target groups.

By combining these powerful filtering options, users are equipped with a comprehensive set of tools to refine their email marketing strategies and boost engagement rate.
