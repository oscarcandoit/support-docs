## **Preparation & Planning**

Before you even log into GoHighLevel or drag your first element, taking some time to plan your website will save you significant time and effort, and result in a much more effective site.

1. Define Your Website's **Purpose**:
1. What is the primary goal of this website? Is it to generate leads, sell products, provide information, build brand awareness, or book appointments? Knowing this will guide all your design and content decisions.

2. Who is your target audience? Understanding their needs, preferences, and pain points will help you tailor the website's content and design to resonate with them.
2. Outline Your **Content & Structure**:
1. What pages do you need? Most business websites start with a Home, About, Services/Products, and Contact page. You might need more or fewer depending on your goals.

2. What key information or call-to-action needs to be on each page? Think about what you want visitors to do or learn on each page.

3. Gather your assets: Do you have your logo, brand colors, images, videos, and written content (or at least an idea of it) ready?
3. A Simple **Plan**: A table can help you map this out. Your plan might look something like this:

| Page/Element | Purpose | Sections & Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Introduce the business, highlight key offerings, main call to action | Main Headline (ex: Welcome to Business)<br>Sub Headline (ex: We help you do Thing)<br>Call To Action (ex: Book a Call)<br>Intro Media (ex: hero image or video sales letter)<br>Overview of each product/service |
| About Us | Build trust, tell your story, introduce the team | Company history/mission<br>Team member photos & bios<br>Values/What makes us different |
| Contact | Allow visitors to get in touch, provide a location | Contact form<br>Phone number, email<br>Address<br>Map |
| Services/Products | Details about what you offer | List and description of products/services<br>Pricing information<br>Benefits<br>Case studies |
| Navigation Menu | Easy site-wide navigation | Logo, links to pages |
| Footer | Important links, copyright, contact info | Copyright notice<br>Privacy policy<br>Terms of service<br>Contact info<br>Social media icons |
