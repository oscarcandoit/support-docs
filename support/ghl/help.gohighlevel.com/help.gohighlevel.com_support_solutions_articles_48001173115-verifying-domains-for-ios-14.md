Step 1: Log into your Facebook Business Manager account at [https://business.facebook.com/](https://business.facebook.com/)

Step 2: Navigate to your client's account > Brand Safety > Domains

Step 3: Click "Add A Domain" and enter the url without the https://

Step 4: Copy the txt record shown in the DNS Verification tab

Step 5: Log into the domain's DNS manager and create a new TXT record using @ for the host name and paste the value you copied from Facebook Business Manager. Save the new record.

Step 6: Go back to Facebook Business Manager and click the Verify button.

**Verifying the root domain automatically verifies any sub.domains of that root**. In your Pixel settings, scroll down to the "Domains on your allow list" section and add your root domain. Once you save, you will see it says "yourdomain and sub-domains"

Then when you are building your Facebook ad and you enter the sub-domain the "Website url" field, it will give you the option to select the corresponding root domain in the Tracking section.

Verifying root domains in Facebook also verifies its sub-domains - YouTube
