## **How To Navigate and Use the WhatsApp Settings**

Understanding the layout of the WhatsApp Settings page is the first step to effectively managing your integration. This section breaks down each component, from the main dashboard to the specific configuration tabs.

**The Header Card**

The header card provides a quick, real-time snapshot of your WhatsApp account's health and recent activity. Use it to monitor key metrics and access high-level account management options.

The card displays your 'Account Status', 'Meta Business Verification' status, and two key statistics:

- **Total Messages Sent (in last 7 days)**: A count of all messages initiated from your account in the past week.

- **Total Messages Delivered (in last 7 days)**: A count and percentage of messages successfully delivered to recipients in the past week.

In the top-right corner of the card, a three-dot action menu button allows you to manage your overall connection:

- **Disconnect**: Click this to sever the connection between HighLevel and your WhatsApp account.

- **Cancel Subscription**: Click this to end your WhatsApp subscription through HighLevel.

WhatsApp requires businesses to use pre-approved message templates for initiating conversations. This section is where you build, organize, and manage these templates to ensure your outbound communications are compliant and effective.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What is the difference between the 'Disconnect' and 'Cancel Subscription' options?**

A: 'Disconnect' temporarily severs the connection between HighLevel and your WhatsApp Business Account, but your subscription and assets remain. 'Cancel Subscription' terminates your WhatsApp functionality.

**Q: Why do I need to create message templates?**

A: Meta's WhatsApp Business Policy requires that businesses use pre-approved message templates to initiate conversations with customers. This ensures a high-quality user experience and prevents spam.

**Q: How long does it take for a template to be approved?**

A: Template approval is handled by Meta and typically takes anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours. You can see the status of your templates in the 'Templates' tab.

**Q: Can I use a regular WhatsApp number for this integration?**

A: No, this integration requires the WhatsApp Business Platform (API), which uses a phone number that is not tied to an active regular or WhatsApp Business app account. You can configure a new or existing number through the 'Numbers' tab.
