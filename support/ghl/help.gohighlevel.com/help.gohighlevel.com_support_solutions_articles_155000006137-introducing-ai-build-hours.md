# Introducing AI Build Hours

Modified on: Thu, 25 Sep, 2025 at 1:39 PM

## What are Build Hours?

Build Hours are 1:1 sessions where our AI experts work with you to get your Conversation AI/Voice AI agents setup and take them live.

## Why did we start this?

We started AI Build Hours to make it easier for you to build your AI agents. Our experts build your AI agent with you–resolving issues, filling in gaps, and getting it as close to launch as possible. It’s the fastest way to turn your use case into a working Voice AI or Conversation AI Agent.

## How do AI Build Hours Work?

1. Book a slot: You’ll receive the meeting link and prep checklist.

2. Arrive prepared: Sessions are hands on and you get to interact 1:1 with the team.

3. Setup : Work with our AI team for implementation & resolving the specific issues.


## How to make the most out of the Build Hours?

A few Nice to Have’s (before the session):

- What outcome do you want this agent to drive (e.g., book more appointments, deflect support, qualify leads)?

- Which channels do you want to support for Conversations AI (SMS, FB/IG, Live Chat, phone)?

- What data should the agent use (FAQ list, website URLs, Google Docs, internal SOPs)? Keeping these details handy helps us with setup your knowledge bases quickly.

- What workflows or custom actions should trigger (workflows, CRMs updates, webhooks, SMS)?

- What handoffs are needed (to humans, to other bots, to a different channel)?

- Here are the [support articles](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/155000000184) and [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@gohighlevel/playlists) for your reference.


Nice to Bring to the session:

- A short prompt/goal outline (tone + do/don’t, success criteria if any).

- Training assets (URLs/Docs) and any FAQ sheet.


## FAQs

How long is a slot?

45 minutes per session.

Will my agent be live by the end?

That’s the goal, we’ll try our best to get there in the given time.

What if I’m starting from scratch?

That’s fine, have your use case, channels, and training data (if any) ready. We’ll stand up a working baseline.

What if my setup is already live but flaky?

Bring recent examples (links to conversations/call logs). We’ll help debug and stabilize.

What if I have a use case that is currently not supported?

We’d love to have a look on what’re the limitations and how we can remove them for you.
