### Why This Playbook Matters

Most agents rely on referrals, open houses, or yard signs. But in today’s digital-first housing market, if you’re not visible online — you’re invisible.

**Industry Metrics:**

- 97% of home buyers use the internet to search for properties

- 70% of real estate leads go with the first agent who responds

- Paid ads generate 200–400% ROI when combined with instant follow-ups


If your competitor is running ads and you're not — you're already behind.

* * *

> This playbook shows you exactly how to build a lead-generation machine using Facebook, Instagram, Google, and retargeting ads — with zero tech stress.

```
Power up your marketing today— Start with HighLevel!
```

* * *

### What You'll Learn:

✅ Generate exclusive buyer & seller leads

✅ Dominate Google Local Services Ads (LSA)

✅ Retarget & bring back site visitors who didn’t book

✅ Automate follow-ups to close faster

✅ Track every lead, ad, and appointment in one place

* * *

## Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads (LSA)

### Why It Matters

When someone decides to buy or sell, they Google “Realtor near me.”

And 3 out of 4 people go with the first agent who responds.

* * *

### 1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads

Appear at the top of search results with keywords like:

- “Top realtor in \[City\]”

- “Sell my house fast”

- “Buy a home near \[Zip Code\]”

- LSAs are pay-per-lead (not click)

- Google Guaranteed badge increases conversion rates by up to 30%


**Use Case:**

An agent in Phoenix using “sell my house fast” LSA ads booked 22% of leads into appointments with automation.

* * *

### 1.2 Run High-Intent Google PPC Ads

Target keywords like:

- “Realtors near me”

- “Homes for sale \[City\]”

- “Free home value report”


Pair ads with a HighLevel landing page CTA like “Find Out What Your Home Is Worth Today”

Start with $25–$50/day focused on high-intent keywords.

* * *

### 1.3 Use Call Tracking & Instant Follow-Ups

- Use HighLevel tracking numbers on your website & GBP

- Trigger missed-call texts & voicemail drops

- Follow up via SMS and email in real time


**Stat:** 78% of real estate leads go cold if not followed up in 5 minutes

✅ Text-back automation helps recover 25–35% of missed leads

* * *

## Step 2: Run Facebook & Instagram Ads

### Why It Matters

Your future clients scroll more than they search. Stay top of mind with targeted, local ads.

#### [Connect Facebook with Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003044-connect-facebook-with-ad-manager)

* * *

### 2.1 Launch Local Lead Ads on Facebook

Use:

- Just Listed / Just Sold visuals

- Client testimonials

- Seasonal offers or downloadable guides


Target:

- Homeowners 30–60

- Zip-code radius or neighborhoods you farm


**Example:**

“Get a free CMA for your home in \[Area\]. No obligation.”

**Use Case:**

An agent in Orlando spent $200 on seller ads and booked 7 listing appointments in 10 days.

* * *

### 2.2 Retarget Visitors Who Didn’t Book

- Show ads to people who visited your website but didn’t opt in

- Promote downloadable guides or free consults


“Still thinking about selling? Grab your free prep checklist.”

Retargeting improves conversion rates by 2.3x.

* * *

### 2.3 Automate Follow-Ups

## Step 3: Capture & Convert Leads with Automation

* * *

### 3.1 Add a Chat Widget to Your Website

Let people text instead of calling — even during showings or weekends.

Offer value like:
✅ “Free home value report”

✅ “Instant tour request”

✅ “Pre-approval consultation”

[How to Set Up Chat Widgets for Real Estate Agent](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)

* * *

### 3.2 Run Text-to-Lead Campaigns

“Text HOMEVALUE to 55555” on:

- Open house signs

- Flyers

- Business cards


Trigger follow-up workflows that deliver your lead magnet or home value report.

* * *

## Step 4: Track, Test & Scale

* * *

### 4.1 Track Your Real ROI

- Use HighLevel’s reporting to monitor CPL, CPA, and conversion sources

- Reallocate budget to top-performing ads

- Pause under performers automatically


#### [How to Set Up Call Tracking for Real Estate Agent Ads](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981393-how-to-set-up-call-tracking-number-pool-)

* * *

### 4.2 A/B Test Ads for Better Results

- Test creative, CTA, and headlines

- Try “Sell in 30 Days” vs. “Maximize Your Sale Price”

- Compare video ads vs. carousels


✅ Agents who A/B test 3 ad variants see 2x more conversions

* * *

## Final Thoughts: Ads That Work While You Work
