# **What is Live Chat Notification Support?**

Live Chat Notification Support alerts you whenever a new Live Chat message is received in HighLevel. Notifications appear through the channels you choose in your profile settings, such as in-app alerts, email, or mobile push. Having all notifications managed in one place makes it easy to stay organized and ensures that important messages are not missed.

This feature works alongside your existing conversation notifications, so you don’t need to manage Live Chat alerts separately. Whether you’re working at your desk, away from the office, or using the mobile app, Live Chat notifications help you maintain quick response times, improve customer engagement, and keep conversations moving without delay. It’s especially valuable for teams handling multiple inquiries, as it ensures everyone stays informed in real time.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Live Chat Notifications**

- **Stay Informed:** Receive alerts for every new Live Chat message, helping you respond in a timely manner.

- **No Separate Setup:** Live Chat notifications use the same settings as other conversation types.

- **One Place to Manage:** All conversation notifications, including Live Chat, are managed in your profile settings.

- **Team Awareness:** Team members with conversation notifications enabled will also receive Live Chat alerts.

- **Flexible Preferences:** Choose the type and frequency of notifications that work best for you.

* * *

## **How to Set Up and Customize Live Chat Notifications**

Live Chat notifications are managed through your conversation notification settings in HighLevel. When conversation notifications are enabled, Live Chat alerts are automatically included. Follow these steps to set them up and customize them to your needs:

### **Open Settings**

From your HighLevel dashboard, click the **Settings** option in the left-hand menu. This is where you can access all account and profile preferences, including your notification settings.

### **Access My Profile**

In the Settings menu, select **My Profile**. This section contains your personal account preferences, including notification settings that control how you receive alerts for Live Chat messages.

### **Open the Notifications Tab**

Click the **Notifications** tab at the top of the page. This is where you can manage all conversation alerts, including Live Chat, and choose how you’d like to be notified.

### **Conversation Notification Options**

These settings control when and how you’ll be alerted about messages and conversations in HighLevel. Here’s what each option means:

- **Notify for all new conversations & messages initiated with the account:** You’ll get alerts whenever anyone starts a new conversation with your account, no matter who it’s for. This helps you stay aware of all incoming communication.

- **Notify when a conversation gets assigned to me:** You’ll be notified when a conversation is specifically given to you to handle. This ensures you know exactly when something is your responsibility.

- **Notify for new messages on a conversation I am assigned to:** If you’re assigned to a conversation, you’ll get alerts every time a new message is added to it, so you can keep up without missing anything.

- **Notify when I am added to an internal chat (In-App: Web only):** This sends you a notification if you’re added to a private chat within your team. These alerts appear only inside the web app.

- **Notify for all new messages in internal chats I am part of (In-App: Web only):** If you’re already in a private internal chat, you’ll get notified about every new message sent there. Like above, this is for the web app only.

- **Notify when I am mentioned in any conversation:** You’ll be alerted if someone tags or mentions you directly in a message. This is useful for catching things that need your attention even if you’re not assigned to the conversation.

- **Notify for all new messages in conversations where I am mentioned:** Once you’ve been mentioned in a conversation, you’ll keep getting alerts for all new messages in that thread, making it easier to follow up.

### **Notification Channels**

These options control _how_ you’ll receive alerts when the selected notification events happen. You can turn on one or more channels depending on what works best for you:

- **In-App Notifications:** These appear inside your HighLevel dashboard while you’re logged in. They’re useful if you spend most of your time working directly in the platform and want to see updates right away.

- **Email Notifications:** These send alerts to your registered email address. This is helpful if you’re often away from the dashboard but still want to stay informed about new activity.

- **SMS Notifications:** These send alerts to your mobile phone via text message. They’re best for urgent updates or when you want to be notified instantly without needing to check email or log in.

### **Save Your Changes**

After setting your preferred notification options and channels, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page. This ensures all your updates are stored and your notification settings will work as you’ve configured them. If you skip this step, your changes won’t be applied.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: If I disable “Notify for all new conversations & messages initiated with the account,” will I still receive Live Chat notifications for conversations assigned to me?**

Yes. Disabling this option only stops alerts for conversations that are not assigned to you. If you keep “Notify when a conversation gets assigned to me” or “Notify for new messages on a conversation I am assigned to” enabled, you will still receive Live Chat notifications for conversations you are directly responsible for.

**Q: Can I receive Live Chat notifications only through mobile push or SMS without enabling in-app or email notifications?**

Yes. Notification channels (In-App, Email, SMS) are independent of each other. You can enable or disable any combination of channels for each conversation notification type. For example, you can select only SMS for urgent updates while leaving in-app and email unchecked.

**Q: How do “Notify when I am mentioned in any conversation” and “Notify for all new messages in conversations where I am mentioned” work together?**

The first option sends you a notification only at the moment you are mentioned in a conversation. The second option continues to send notifications for every new message in that conversation after the mention, even if you are not directly tagged again. To follow a conversation after being mentioned, both options should be enabled.

**Q: If I change my notification preferences, will it affect other users in the same sub-account?**

No. Notification preferences are specific to your user profile and do not affect other users in the sub-account. Each user can set their own preferences for conversation types, notification events, and channels.
