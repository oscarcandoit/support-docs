# **What is a Snapshot?**

Snapshot creation allows agency users to duplicate an existing sub-account's setup, which can then be loaded into other sub-accounts. This process is especially useful when onboarding new clients, maintaining brand consistency, or scaling a service offering efficiently. Once a snapshot is created, it can be used multiple times across multiple sub-accounts.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Snapshots**

- **Reusability:** Create templates for recurring client types or agency packages that can be reused anytime.

- **Workflow consistency:** Maintain standardized setups across multiple client accounts for streamlined operations.

- **Selective asset control:** Include everything or choose specific assets to tailor snapshots to your use case.

- **Faster onboarding:** Reduce setup time when launching new subaccounts by loading a prebuilt configuration.

- **Version safety**: Preserve your original configuration before making big changes to a client’s setup.

* * *

## **How to Create a Snapshot**

- Log into your Agency View

- In the left-hand navigation menu, click **Account Snapshots**

- Click the blue **\+ Create New Snapshot** button in the upper-right corner

- Choose which assets to include in your snapshot.




  - **Include all assets:** Click the checkbox labeled **Select All** at the top of the screen. This will automatically select every available asset in the sub-account

  - **Select specific assets:** If you want to include only certain elements, you can choose assets by category




    - To include all assets within a category, click the **Select All** checkbox next to that category.

    - To include specific assets within a category, click the **plus (+) icon** to expand the list, then check only the assets you want included. Repeat this process for each category you want to customize.
- Click the blue **Proceed** button in the bottom-right corner of the screen to finalize your selections and create your new snapshot

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I update a snapshot later?**

Yes, you can update an existing snapshot from the Agency Dashboard. To do this, go to **Account Snapshots** and locate the snapshot you want to edit. Click the **three-dot** menu next to it, and select **Edit Snapshot**. From there, you can rename the snapshot or update the assets included in it.

**Q: Are there any items that snapshots do not include?**

Yes. Snapshots do not include contacts, conversations, appointment data, reputation management history, or external integrations like Stripe or third-party API keys. These will need to be manually configured after loading the snapshot. For details on this topic, read [Snapshots - Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982511)

**Q: How many times can I use a snapshot?**

There is no limit. You can use a snapshot as many times as you’d like. Snapshots can be loaded into any number of sub-accounts, making them ideal for scalable and repeatable client setups.

**Q: Can I share a snapshot with a different agency account?**

Yes. Snapshots can be shared with other agencies using a Snapshot Share Link. For details on this topic, read [How to Share Snapshots](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982513)
