**What is a Conditional Element?**

A conditional element allows you to display content—such as images or text—only if a contact meets certain criteria. This enables you to tailor your messaging to individual contacts automatically.

### **When Can You Use Them?**

1. **Location-based content**: Display different images or offers depending on a contact’s geographic location.
2. **Field-based text**: Change a text element based on specific contact fields, like their job title or interests.

### **Benefits**

1. **Personalization**: Make your campaigns more relevant by showing customized content to each contact.
2. **Time-Saving**: Avoid the need to create smart lists and separate campaigns—use one campaign with conditional elements instead.
3. **Increased Engagement**: Showing content that's personalized to each recipient increases the likelihood of higher click-through rates, responses, and conversions.

4. **Simplified Campaign Management**: Instead of juggling various lists and campaigns, manage all variations of content in one place, reducing complexity and chances for error.


### **How to Use Conditional Elements**:

- Go to **Marketing** \> **Email Marketing**.
- Create an email campaign or template.
- Select any element and go to the **Visibility** tab.
- Enable the **Conditional Element** toggle.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034934576/original/nJEczKlrhy-sGalDVPmbbvu8rzsIAZio6w.png?1729231613)
- Set the conditions based on contact fields.
- Alternatively, click on the **Conditional Element** icon in the element overlay action to add conditions easily.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034934578/original/dG2C-mcFzZ8WuRBnZhVroUXJX4vdKi6pIA.png?1729231621)
