# From 'Just Browsing' to 'Book Me Now': Your Salon Lead Gen Funnel That Fills Your Calendar

Modified on: Tue, 13 May, 2025 at 3:12 AM

## **Why This Funnel Works for Salons**

Your dream clients are already online — scrolling through Instagram, Googling “facial near me,” and clicking on promos. But without the right follow-through, most of them never take the next step. They like your posts, maybe tap your story, maybe even click the link in bio... and then disappear.

That’s where your **Lead Generation Funnel** comes in. It’s not just a landing page. It’s a guided experience — one that turns interest into action, and clicks into confirmed appointments.

This guide will walk you through building a high-converting funnel that doesn’t just look good — it works.

We’re not just setting up forms. We’re building your **client magnet machine.**

* * *

## **Understanding the Structure of a High-Converting Salon Funnel**

Every salon lead funnel should follow this sequence:

1. **Landing Page** — A visually compelling, on-brand page that clearly communicates your offer

2. **Lead Capture Form** — A short form where clients drop their name and number

3. **Thank You Page** — A confirmation page that tells them what to do next

4. **Automated Follow-Up** — Texts or emails that remind and encourage them to book

5. **Tracking + Retargeting (Optional but powerful)** — Useful for ad campaigns later on


Each part plays a specific role — together, they move someone from “I’m curious” to “I’m booking now.”

## **Step 1: Craft an Offer That Feels Like a Steal**

This is the first and most important piece. If the offer doesn’t feel exciting or exclusive, people won’t fill out the form — no matter how pretty the page looks.

Think about what first-time clients care about: trust, results, and feeling special. Then craft your offer to speak to that.

**Examples of irresistible salon offers:**

- “First-time facial: Just $50 for your full glow-up experience”

- “Free 15-minute consultation + scalp check with any hair service”

- “Bridal trial offer: 10% off your wedding-day package when you book now”

- “Book any full-face cleanup and get brow threading free”


Don’t worry about giving everything away. The point here is to get them in the door. A small intro offer can easily lead to bigger bookings — full facials, treatments, bridal packages, and recurring visits.

## **Step 2: Build a Simple, Beautiful Landing Page in GHL**

Now that you’ve got your offer, it’s time to create the page that promotes it. This is your salon’s digital storefront for that offer — it needs to be clear, welcoming, and easy to navigate.

Using GHL’s drag-and-drop builder, you can design your own page without writing a single line of code.

**What your landing page should include:**

- A **strong headline** that states the offer clearly

- 2 to 3 short bullet points explaining the benefits ("Get glowing skin, save time with online booking, experience personalized beauty care")

- One or two testimonials or transformation photos

- A **form** to collect the lead’s information

- A big, bold **call-to-action button** that says “Claim This Offer” or “Book Now”


Keep it short. The goal is not to explain your entire service menu — it’s to get them to sign up.

**[How to have different websites for desktop and phone](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001161151-how-to-have-different-websites-for-desktop-and-phone)**

* * *

## **Step 3: Add a Short, Effective Lead Capture Form**

This is the form someone fills out on your landing page. It tells you who’s interested — and gives you a way to follow up.

**Form fields to include:**

- First Name (so you can personalize messages)

- Phone Number (for SMS reminders)

- Email (optional but useful for confirmations)

- A dropdown for service of interest (optional)


Keep the form short. Too many fields can scare people off. Your goal is to get the minimum amount of info needed to follow up.

Once your form is ready, embed it into your funnel.

**[Form Builder Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000980307-two-step-order-form-step-1-)**

* * *

## **Step 4: Guide Them with a Thank You Page**

The thank-you page is more than just a “you’re done” message. It’s your chance to move them toward actually booking.

Here’s what your thank-you page should do:

- Confirm that you received their submission

- Let them know what to expect next (“We’ll text you shortly with your booking link.”)

- Offer an immediate action — like scheduling now

- Optionally, include a short intro video of you or your team welcoming them


Also a great place to include:

- Social media links ("Follow us on Instagram for beauty inspo")

- A referral bonus (“Tag us after your visit and get $10 off next time”)


**[How to add CTA to your webpage](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000980316-click-to-call-click-to-text-and-click-to-email-links-buttons)**

* * *

## **Step 5: Automate the Follow-Up (So You Never Drop a Lead Again)**

Now that someone has submitted the form, your system needs to do the heavy lifting.

Set up an automated workflow that sends:

- **Immediate SMS**: “Hey \[Name\], thanks for claiming your offer! Tap here to book your glow-up: \[booking link\]”

- **Follow-up email**: Share a bit more about your salon, your team, or the experience

- **Reminder text** (after 48 hours): “Still interested in booking your \[service\]? Slots are filling up — book now.”


All of this can be built in GHL’s **Workflow Builder** — and once it’s set, it runs automatically.

**[Getting started with Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002288-getting-started-with-workflows)**

* * *

## **Step 6: Track Every Lead with a Pipeline**

Your funnel is generating leads — now it’s time to track them.

Using GHL’s **Opportunities Pipeline**, you can visually move each lead across stages like:

- New Lead

- Contacted

- Booking Pending

- Appointment Confirmed

- Won Client


You can also add **tags** like:

- “Facial $50”

- “Hair Consult – May”

- “Bridal Trial – Hot Lead”


This helps you stay organized and know exactly who’s ready to book — and who needs a little nudge.

**[Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Opportunities](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001999-step-by-step-guide-creating-opportunities)**

* * *

## **Step 7: (Optional) Add Facebook Pixel and Run Retargeting Ads**

If you plan to run paid ads — or already are — install your **Meta Pixel** now.

It lets you retarget people who visited your landing page but didn’t fill the form.

Example: someone clicks your Instagram ad, reads your offer, then closes the tab. Two days later, they see a new ad saying: “Still thinking about glowing skin? Claim your $50 facial today.”

* * *

## **Final Words: Your Funnel Is Your Front Door**

If your salon’s Instagram and website are the showcase windows, this funnel is your **front door**.

You don’t need dozens of ads or offers. Just one powerful, well-executed funnel can bring a steady stream of leads — and your systems can take care of the rest.

Now, you’re not waiting for leads to message you. You’re guiding them to book.
