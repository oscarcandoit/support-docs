# **What is the Business Profile?**

Your Business Profile is the section of your sub-account settings where you can assign company data and configure settings that are applied across the entire sub-account. Setting up this section, and spending a few minutes configuring the settings, is critical to the way your sub-account operates.

To help you better understand all the components and elements within the Business Profile, we will be going through all the sections and settings one-by-one and explaining how to configure them and even giving you some use cases that will help you understand the outcome of each setting and configuration.

## **Where Do I Find the Business Profile?**

Navigating to your Business Profile is quick and easy! We have also provided some screenshots below to help you find your way if you are more of a visual learner!

- Make sure you are in the chosen sub-account

- Click the **Settings** navigation item on the left side of your screen

- Once you are in **Settings**, the **Business Profile** will be the first navigation button in the **Settings** menu on the left-hand side of your screen.

- The **Business** **Profile** is also the first page of settings by default, so once you click the **Settings** button, you will automatically see the Business Profile
