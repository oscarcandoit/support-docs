# **What is Rename Standard Objects Feature?**

HighLevel now lets Admins relabel the three core CRM objects—Contacts, Opportunities, and Companies—with words that match their organization’s lingo (e.g., “Clients,” “Deals,” “Organizations”). The change is purely cosmetic: the system’s underlying data keys stay intact, so all automations, reports, and API calls continue to work as before.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Renaming Standard Objects**

- **Business-aligned language:** Rename objects to match the terms your team uses.

- **Faster adoption:** Familiar labels boost everyday usage across teams.

- **Easier onboarding:** New users recognize terms immediately and ramp faster.

- **Clearer reporting:** Dashboards and filters read the way your business speaks.

- **System-safe changes:** Display names update without altering underlying data/keys.

- **Consistent everywhere:** One change propagates across navigation, filters, workflows, and dashboards.

* * *

## **How to Rename a Standard Object**

```
Note: Only Admins with Settings → Custom Objects access can rename standard objects; all other users will see the new names but can’t edit them.
```

1. Go to **Settings.**

2. Click on **Objects**.

3. Click on the **three** **bots** on the object you want to rename (e.g., _Contacts_).

4. Click on **Edit**.

## **Naming Rules & Limitations**

- You can rename **all standard objects** (Contacts, Opportunities, Companies).

- Maximum length: **50 characters** for both singular and plural names.

- Names must be **unique** — no two objects can share the same singular or plural name.

- Internal object keys remain unchanged to ensure backend stability.

- Renaming **does not currently update field names or folders** (coming soon!).


* * *

## **Examples**

| Original Object | New Singular Name | New Plural Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contacts | Client | Clients |
| Opportunities | Deal | Deals |
| Companies | Organization | Organizations |

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will changing object names break my workflows or API integrations?**

A No. The internal object keys remain the same; only the display labels change.

**Q: Can two objects share the same name?**

A No. Each singular and plural label must be unique platform-wide.

**Q Who can rename objects?**

A Only Admins with access to Settings → Objects. Regular users see the updated names but cannot edit them.
