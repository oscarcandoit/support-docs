## **Error: Unable to log you in at this time**

1\. Ask them which Internet service provider (ISP) they are using

If they have **Verizon Fios**, they may disable protection here:

[https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/internet/essentials/home-network-protection](https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/internet/essentials/home-network-protection)

If they have **CenturyLink**, they may disable secure wifi here:

[https://kb.plu.edu/page.php?id=109248](https://kb.plu.edu/page.php?id=109248)

If they have had **Survey Junkie** before, they may uninstall to see if it will work as it will update all SSL certificates on your website.

If they have **McAfee** installed, they may turn off web protection here

[https://www.help.k12.com/s/article/McAfee-Web-Protection-Enable-Disable](https://www.help.k12.com/s/article/McAfee-Web-Protection-Enable-Disable)

If they have **xfinity**, please check

[https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/online-security-with-xfi-faqs](https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/online-security-with-xfi-faqs)

If they are using **Spectrum**, they may turn off Security Shield here:

[https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/security-shield](https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/security-shield)

We will be working on a long-term solution in the meantime. As long as the user is browsing secure websites on their device, turning off the protection feature should not bring any risks.

2\. If they are not using the ISP mentioned above:

When they are trying to log in, Inspect the page, Open the network tab and create a loom with the request being sent. Show the response for the API.

You can give us a call at [(888) 732-4197](tel:+18887324197) to open a ticket and send us a Loom video like the one below for us to take a look further.

Please reach out to the agency admin to add a **user phone number** for the user who tries to log in so they can send the 2FA code to the user's phone number. If you are the only agency admin, please reach out to us at [(888) 732-4197](tel:+18887324197) so we can update the user phone number for you.
