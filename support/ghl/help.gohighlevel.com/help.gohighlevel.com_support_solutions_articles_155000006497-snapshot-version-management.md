# Snapshot Version Management

Modified on: Tue, 14 Oct, 2025 at 10:35 AM

Snapshots Version Management lets agencies see exactly what changed in a snapshot after every refresh. Use Version History to review added, removed, and synced assets, and rely on version references in Account Snapshots to keep teams aligned. This article explains how to view versions, interpret changes, and adopt best practices for cleaner, faster audits.

# **What is Snapshots Version Management?**

Snapshots Version Management is an enhancement to the Snapshot asset viewer in HighLevel that records a new version each time you successfully refresh a snapshot. Teams can browse a chronological Version History and open details for any version to understand what changed compared to the previous version. This brings precise change visibility to the templates you use to copy assets across sub-accounts.

With Version Management, you can see a clear history of updates each time you refresh a snapshot. Every update shows what was added, what was removed, and what stayed the same compared with last time. The version is shown wherever you manage or share the snapshot so your team and clients are always on the same page. Each item also notes where it lives in your account, making it easy to find and edit later.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Snapshots Version Management**

Understanding change over time is critical for collaboration and troubleshooting. Version Management centralizes this visibility so you can audit snapshot contents quickly and coordinate with clients and teammates.

- **Audit trail:** Review a chronological list of versions with high-level change summaries.

- **Faster troubleshooting:** Compare versions to verify what changed between a share and an import.

- **Team alignment:** Keep everyone in sync by confirming you’re all on the same version.

- **Operational accuracy:** Product category labels guide you to the right area in the sub-account to locate assets.

- **Less busywork:** Replace manual spreadsheets with built-in, source-of-truth history.


* * *

## **Version History Panel**

The Version History panel provides a dated list of every version that was created by a successful refresh. It makes it easy to scan who refreshed the snapshot and what changed at a glance.

What you’ll see:

- A **chronological list** of versions with **creation date/time**

- A **concise change summary** per version indicating **Added**, **Removed**, and **Synced** counts relative to the previous version

- The ability to **select a version** to open its detailed summary

* * *

## **Version History Details (Added, Removed, Synced)**

Opening a version displays a grouped summary of assets to help you understand the delta from the previous version. This view reduces guesswork when confirming whether a particular funnel, workflow, or other asset changed.

In the details view you can:

- See assets grouped by type (for example: **Funnels**, **Workflows**, **Emails**, and more)

- Review which assets were **Added**, **Removed**, or **Synced** compared to the immediate prior version

- Use this information to confirm the exact contents of a version before sharing or importing

* * *

## **Version Reference in Snapshots Lists**

Version references appear across key snapshot lists so you can quickly confirm which version was shared or imported during collaboration with partners or clients.

Where version references appear:

- **My Snapshots**

- **Imported Snapshots**

- **Shared Snapshots**

## **How To Use Snapshots Version Management**

Proper setup ensures your team records versions consistently and can rely on Version History during reviews. Follow these steps to begin using Version Management in day-to-day work.

1. Go to **Agency view** → **Account Snapshots** → **My Snapshots**.

2. Click a snapshot name to open the **Snapshot asset viewer**.

3. Switch to the **Version History** tab to see all recorded versions.

4. In **Version History**, click any version row to open the **Version Details** summary (Added/Removed/Synced).

5. When you’ve added or updated assets, from the **My Snapshots** list view click on **Refresh Snapshot**. A **new version** is created after a successful **refresh.**



![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055598717/original/jecfRzO9tbE-1i1455jJMqLIUzBrV5I6fQ.png?1760005455)

6. When sharing or importing, use the version reference in **My Snapshots/Imported Snapshots/Shared Snapshots** to confirm alignment with collaborators.

## **Example Use Cases**

These scenarios illustrate practical ways to apply Version History and version references so teams can coordinate releases, reduce back-and-forth with clients, and resolve “what changed?” questions quickly.

- **Decide what to push at scale:** Before pushing updates to many locations, confirm the intended version in **Version History** and scan the delta to avoid pushing incomplete changes. Then proceed with your push workflow. See [**Pushing & Loading Snapshot Updates to Client Accounts**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000982587-pushing-loading-snapshot-updates-to-client-accounts) and [**Snapshot Push Update History**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004171-snapshot-push-update-history).

- **Pre-share QA of a refresh:** After updating assets, open **Version History** and review the latest version’s **Added/Removed/Synced** summary to confirm only the intended changes are included before you share the snapshot. See [**How to Share Snapshots**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000982513-how-to-share-snapshots).

- **Align with partners/clients on the exact build:** When collaborating with another agency or location, compare the **version reference** in **My Snapshots** with what they see in **Imported/Shared Snapshots** so everyone works from the same version.

- **Troubleshoot missing or unexpected assets after import:** If a location reports that a funnel/workflow is missing, open the **Version Details** for the version they imported to verify whether the asset was **Removed** or **Synced**. Then guide the user to the correct area using **product category labels**. Related: [**How to Import Snapshots**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000982581-how-to-import-snapshots).

- **Verify deprecations during clean-up:** If you’re retiring assets from a template, refresh the snapshot and check that those items appear under **Removed** in the latest version—use this as your confirmation that the clean-up is reflected in the snapshot.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: When is a version created?**

A new version is created **after a successful snapshot refresh**. Opening or editing the snapshot without refreshing will not create a version.

**Q: Can I revert a snapshot to a previous version?**

Version Management provides visibility and references for auditing; it does not include a built-in revert/restore action.

**Q: Does a failed refresh create a version?**

No. Versions are created for successful refreshes only.

**Q: Where can I see the version reference?**

Version references appear in **My Snapshots**, **Imported Snapshots**, and **Shared Snapshots** lists.

**Q: Who can view Version History and Version Details?**

Access depends on user roles and permissions. See **[Granular Permissions for Snapshots](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004594-granular-permissions-for-snapshots)** for guidance.

**Q: What does “Synced” mean in the Version Details?**

“Synced” indicates the asset was included in both the previous and current version without being added or removed.

**Q: Does Version Management automatically update my client sub-accounts?**

No. Version Management is informational. Pushing/loading updates to locations is a separate workflow.

**Q: How should I use Version History before pushing to many locations?**

Confirm the intended snapshot version in **Version History** first, then proceed with your push. For notification behavior during pushes, see **[Rolling Notifications for Snapshot Push](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005833-rolling-notifications-for-snapshot-push)**.
