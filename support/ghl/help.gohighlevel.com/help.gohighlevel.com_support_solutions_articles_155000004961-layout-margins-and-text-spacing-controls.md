# **What Are Layout Margins and Text Spacing Controls in the Email Builder?**

In HighLevel’s Email Builder, **layout margins** control the space between content blocks, while **text spacing controls** let you customize spacing above and below different text elements (like headings and paragraphs). These tools allow you to fine-tune email formatting for a polished, professional look without relying on workarounds.

## **Key Benefits of Margin and Text Spacing Controls for Emails**

These new settings make it easier to build better-looking emails with less effort—directly inside the drag-and-drop builder.

    •    Set vertical spacing between sections, rows, and content blocks.

    •    Control top and bottom spacing for headings (H1–H4) and paragraph text.

    •    Improve readability and overall layout balance in your emails.

    •    Ensure consistency across email campaigns and templates.

    •    Reduce the need for spacer elements or custom code.

## **How to Adjust Layout Margins in the Email Builder**

Layout margins help you define the space between blocks and sections in your email layout.

    1\.    Open the **Email Builder** from the Marketing → Emails tab.

    2\.    Click on a **layout block** (e.g., row, section, or column) in the email.

    3\.    In the **settings panel on the right**, scroll to the **Margin** section.

    4\.    Adjust the **Top** and **Bottom** margins using the slider or by entering a specific value (in px).

    5\.    The margin changes will preview in real time.

    6\.    Click **Save** to preserve your changes.

* * *

## **How to Customize Text Spacing for Email Headings and Paragraphs**

Text spacing controls allow you to define spacing around text tags (e.g., H1, H2, Paragraph) to maintain consistent typography throughout your email content.

    1\.    Go to **Settings** → **Appearance** in your HighLevel account.

    2\.    Click on **Typography Settings**.

    3\.    Locate the **Email** section.

    4\.    Enable or edit the spacing for each text tag:

    •    **Spacing Before** (adds space above the tag)

    •    **Spacing After** (adds space below the tag)

    5\.    Enter your desired spacing (e.g., 10px, 1rem).

    6\.    Click **Save** to apply changes to all emails using that tag style.
