# **What is Creating Subscriptions & Invoices in Contact Details Page?**

Creating billing items from the contact record lets you act at the moment of conversation, without navigating to global Payments lists. This workflow pre-fills the customer and keeps all billing history visible in one place, improving speed, accuracy, and customer experience.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Creating from the Contact Details Page**

- **Speed:** create and send a bill without leaving the conversation.

- **Fewer errors:** contact details auto-fill, reducing manual entry.

- **Context:** view past invoices, subscriptions, and payment methods alongside CRM activity.

- **Lifecycle visibility:** see the new subscription/invoice instantly on the contact timeline and in Payments.

- **Team efficiency:** front-line teams can charge or schedule billing during support or sales calls.


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

- Connect a supported payment provider in **Payments > Integrations** (for example, Stripe).

- Ensure payment methods are enabled for your product areas.

- Have at least one Recurring **Product** configured for selling as a subscription.

- Confirm **tax** and **discount** settings match your accounting rules.

- Confirm user **permissions** for Payments allow creating subscriptions/invoices.

- Optional but recommended: Add a **card on file** for the contact to enable AutoPay and reduce failures.

# **How to Create Subscriptions in Contact's Profile**

```
Important: The subscription’s billing cycle is inherited from the recurring product you select. Whatever cycle you set on that product (e.g., weekly, monthly, annually) becomes the subscription’s cycle.
```

1. Go to **Contacts** and open the contact’s profile.

3. Choose a **Recurring** **Product**, and configure **start date**, **quantity, and** **coupon** as needed.

4. Select or add a **payment method** on file for AutoPay, if available.

5. Review the first charge amount and **schedule**.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do I set the billing cycle for subscriptions?**

The subscription’s billing cycle is inherited from the **recurring product** you select. Whatever cycle you set on that product (e.g., monthly, weekly, annually) becomes the subscription’s cycle.

**Q: What happens if a customer’s payment method fails during subscription setup?**

If a payment method fails, the system will prompt you to select an alternate card or add a new one. The subscription will not be activated until a valid payment method is added.

**Q: Can I create multiple subscriptions for the same customer?**

Yes, you can create multiple subscriptions for a single customer. Each subscription can have its own products, billing dates, and payment methods.
