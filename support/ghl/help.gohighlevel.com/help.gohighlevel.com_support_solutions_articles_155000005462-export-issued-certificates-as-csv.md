# **What is Certificate Exporting?**

Certificate exporting allows users to download issued certificate records in bulk as a **CSV file**, complete with metadata such as recipient name, email, date issued, and certificate ID. This is ideal for teams managing training completions, course certifications, or audits.

## **Key Benefits of Exporting Issued Certificates**

Easily access and manage your certificate data by exporting it to CSV format. Here’s why it’s useful:

- Export up to 500 certificates instantly via in-app download

- Automatically receive CSV by email if over 500 certificates

- Filter by custom date ranges to narrow results

- Use exports for compliance, analytics, or integrations

- CSV format is universally accepted and easy to manipulate

- Streamline reporting or sync with external LMS tools


* * *

## **How to Export Certificates as a CSV File**

Exporting your certificate data is simple and flexible. Here’s how to do it:

1. Navigate to the **“Issued Certificates”** section of your Certificates app.

2. Click the **Export CSV** button located at the top right corner.

3. A **date range filter** will appear — select the desired time period for the certificates you want to export.

4. Click **Confirm Export** to begin.


- If your export contains **fewer than 500 certificates**, the CSV file will download immediately to your device.

- If the export includes **more than 500 certificates**, you’ll see a message indicating that the file will be emailed to your **login email address** when it’s ready.


## **Export Logic & Delivery Rules**

Understanding how certificate export works helps avoid confusion and ensures smooth operation when handling large data sets.

- **< 500 Certificates**: CSV downloads immediately in-browser.

- **\> 500 Certificates**: CSV is emailed to the logged-in user.

- **Email Subject Line**: “Your Certificate Export is Ready”

- **Link Expiration**: The download link in the email is valid for **24 hours** only.

- **Date Range Required**: Users must select a date range before exporting to define the export boundaries.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I export certificates without filtering by date?**

No. A date range is mandatory to limit the dataset and optimize performance.

**Q: Where will the CSV file be sent?**

If the export exceeds 500 certificates, the CSV will be emailed to the email address associated with your HighLevel account.

**Q: How long is the CSV download link valid?**

The emailed download link is valid for **24 hours**.

**Q: What data is included in the CSV export?**

The export includes: Full Name, Email Address, Certificate ID, Date Issued, and optionally, Course Name or Tags (if configured).

**Q: Can I re-download a previous export?**

No. You must re-export using the same date range if the original link expires.
