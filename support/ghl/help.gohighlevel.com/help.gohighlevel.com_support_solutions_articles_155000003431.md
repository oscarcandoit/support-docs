# Inbound Call Flow for Voice AI calls

Modified on: Wed, 2 Jul, 2025 at 11:17 AM

When setting up Voice AI, you'll need to understand how the inbound call flow works so you can maximize the AI's efficiency. There are a few different scenarios where your Voice AI Agent will be involved in the phone call. You can either have the Voice AI Agent pick up the call immediately or have the Voice AI Agent pick up when the call has reached your voicemail or timed out.

# **Voice AI WITHOUT Call Forwarding**

```
IMPORTANT: If you do NOT use call forwarding, and you are using Voice AI Agents, the Voice AI Agent will ALWAYS pick up the call unless the phone number you use for the AI Agent is your DEFAULT sub-account phone number.
```

There are many reasons why sending your inbound calls directly to your Voice AI Agents would be beneficial, but the most likely scenario is that you are just too busy to answer the phone all day. If this is the case, the Voice AI Agent will be your personal office employee, answering calls, fielding leads, and collecting customer information for further follow-up!

**To setup your Voice AI call flow so that your AI Agent always picks up the inbound call:**

- Do NOT assign your default account phone number to your AI Agent.

- Do NOT assign call forwarding to the phone number assigned to your AI Agent.

# **Voice AI WITH Call Forwarding**

If you are forwarding inbound calls to your office or cell phone, you will need to adjust your setup slightly so that your Voice AI Agent will still answer calls when you are unavailable.

**To setup your Voice AI call flow so that your AI Agent picks up missed calls, you can setup one of the following scenarios:**

- Assign your default account phone number to your AI Agent.

- Assign call forwarding to the phone number assigned to your AI Agent.

```
IMPORTANT: No matter which of the scenarios you choose, we recommend that you reduce the "Inbound Call Timeout" period so the inbound caller never reaches your local voicemail.

If the caller reaches your local voicemail, HighLevel will mark that call as "completed" and the Voice AI Agent will not answer the call.
```
