3\. Once the post is sent for review, an email will be delivered for the scheduled post.

4\.  The reviewer can see the post in Content > Approval tab with the option to view, approve or reject. The view option will allow user to view the details of post than approve or reject. The reviewer team member can view option and it has option to edit the content too for approval flow by clicking "Edit" in view screen.

5\. Once the post is approved, it will be scheduled in the social calendar. If the post is rejected, the user can view the comment sent by the reviewer.

6\. Approvers can reschedule posts directly within the approval flow, making it easier to adjust publishing times without needing to send posts back for editing.

## **Editing and applying an Email Template as the Post Approval Email:**

Users can set the email for approval from Social Planner Settings. The email template can be branded by visiting **Marketing > Emails> Templates > New > Email Marketing Templates**

You will then be taken to the Template Library where you will need to head to **System Templates> Social Planner : Post Approval** and use the template. You can edit it as you see fit.
