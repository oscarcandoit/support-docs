# How to set up Google Ad Conversion Actions

Modified on: Wed, 9 Apr, 2025 at 5:00 AM

Google AdWords has a feature called conversion action. This allows you to track the success of your ads and optimise them accordingly. It’s an essential tool for advertisers who want to maximise their return on investment (ROI).

A conversion can be a specific customer action you've defined as valuable to your business, such as an online purchase or phone call. Conversion tracking shows you what happens after a customer interacts with your ads -- whether they purchased a product, signed up for your newsletter, and called your business.

In this article, we will show you how to set up conversion tracking in Google AdWords action in workflows so that you can start optimising your campaigns.

* * *

## **Note before getting started**

```
1. For the most effective reporting, please make sure to set up Google Ad reporting [How to setup Google Ad Reporting]

2. Please check that you have integrated the correct MCC id and Google Id to the location and that the email associated has the highest permissions (admin).

3. UTM Tracking template is added to Google Ad Account, in Account settings or campaign settings or ad level setup. (It can ONLY be present in one place)

# **Custom Mapping**

Previously, the system automatically mapped Google Click Identifier (GCLID), GBRAID, and WBRAID for conversion tracking. With the introduction of this new option, users can now custom map these parameters based on their specific use case.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044788285/original/2ciMoutBmiBG7b7fJ270W1p1GB-dLvK1CA.png?1744191914)

**How It Works:**

- By default, custom mapping is disabled.
- Users can toggle it on to enable custom mapping.
- When enabled, users can map GCLID, GBRAID, and WBRAID to their own custom values.
- If custom mapping fields are provided, they will take priority over system defaults.
- If left empty, the system will continue using its default internal values.

* * *

# **Troubleshooting⁣**

⁣

### **I have set up my conversions now how do I know it's working? ⁣**

Currently, there is no way to test this event. You can always check your workflow action and check out the history tab⁣. It should show the execution for Google Adword Action.

⁣⁣

### **Where can I see my conversions?⁣**

It will take approximately 5 minutes to get the list populated in trigger/workflow as well as in Google AdWords Conversion. ⁣Within the 15 minutes window, you can check the workflow history.⁣

### **Does this work with all triggers?⁣**

It **only works** for Form Submission, Order Purchase, Number Pool Calling, Survey Submission, and Chat Widget.
