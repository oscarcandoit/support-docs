**Please Note:** When a **custom field contains the word "score"** in its name, the system **automatically interprets it as a numeric scoring element**. This happens across: **Forms,** **Surveys and** **Quizzes.** This behavior is hardcoded and tied to how we currently identify **scoring elements** in its implementations.

## **What’s New?**

### **Quick Add Custom Fields:**

Previously, adding custom fields required multiple steps through the Add Custom Field modal. Now, with Quick Add, you can easily create custom fields by dragging and dropping them into the form.

### **Custom Fields which we can be draggable now:**

- Radio Select
- Single and Multi Dropdown
- Checkbox
- File upload
- Single Line
- Multi line
- Textbox List
- Date picker
- Number
- Monetary


### **Customization Options:**

Customize options for dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes, including file input options for file upload fields. You can set the custom field name and unique key.

### **Simplified Workflow:**

Saving the form/survey will save the custom fields, making them available across all places.

### **Editing Capabilities:**

You can edit properties of newly created or existing custom fields, such as customizing options (editing, ordering, and deleting), and file input options.

To edit a custom field added to a form or survey:

- Click on the custom field within the form or survey builder.

- A navigation bar will appear on the right side.

- Use the options in the **General Settings** and **Advanced Settings** dropdowns to make the required changes.


### **Field Locking:**

After saving the form/survey, the custom field name and unique key are locked. They can be edited from the custom fields section.

## **How It Works**

### **Drag and Drop:**

Drag and drop the desired field into the form.

### **Customize:**

Customize the options for dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes, or file input options for file upload fields. Set the custom field name and unique key if needed.

### **Save:**

Save the form/survey to save the custom fields, making them available across all places.

### **Edit:**

Edit newly created or existing custom field properties from the custom fields section and save the form/survey.

## **Why This Feature?**

The Quick Add Custom Fields feature is designed to save time and reduce the complexity of managing custom fields. By allowing users to add fields on-the-fly, we aim to enhance the overall user experience and improve workflow efficiency.

## **Removing Outdated or Irrelevant Custom Fields**

If you’re seeing outdated custom fields in your form builder—even after deleting them from the form—they may still exist in your CRM’s custom fields list.

To fully remove them:

- Navigate to **Settings > Custom Fields.**
- Locate the outdated field in the list.
- Click the **Tr** **ash** icon to permanently delete it.

```
Warning: Deleting a custom field from this section removes it from all forms, surveys, and contacts where it was used.
```

When a **custom field contains the word "score"** in its name, the system **automatically interprets it as a numeric scoring element**. This happens across:

- **Forms**
- **Surveys**
- **Quizzes**

This behavior is hardcoded and tied to how we currently identify **scoring elements** in its implementations.
