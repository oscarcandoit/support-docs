## **What Is Reply In Comments?**

In your Facebook or Instagram account there are comments on your post. Once a workflow has been triggered by one of these comments, you can use this action to reply to that comment with a comment underneath it. You can also like the comment.

```
Note that the Reply In Comments action must be used with a relevant trigger: Facebook Comment(s) On A Post or Instagram Comment(s) On A Post.
```
