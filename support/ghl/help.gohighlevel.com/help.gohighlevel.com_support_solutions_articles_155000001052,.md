## **Benefits of Automatic Social Posts From RSS Feed**

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) can be a valuable tool for managing and curating content in social media. Here are some ways RSS can help in social media:

- **Content Curation:** Aggregate content from various sources into one feed to easily discover relevant items to share.

- **Automated Content Sharing:** Auto‑post content to your social accounts to save time and maintain a consistent flow.

- **Stay Updated with Industry Trends:** Subscribe to industry blogs/news to create timely, relevant posts.

- **Reduce Information Overload:** Consolidate content in one place instead of browsing many sites.

- **Share User‑Generated Content:** Monitor community/forum feeds and share standout contributions.

- **Maintain a Consistent Posting Schedule:** Use scheduling tools with RSS to keep a steady cadence.


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

- A **valid RSS/Atom feed URL** (e.g., from your blog or YouTube channel).

- Social accounts connected in **Marketing → Social Planner → Settings** (e.g., Facebook Page, Instagram Business, LinkedIn Profile/Page, Google Business Profile, Pinterest).

## **How to find the RSS Feed?**

RSS feeds are still very much alive, though they may be a bit trickier to locate these days. Unlike in the past, browsers no longer highlight them, and websites don't always prominently display RSS links. However, the majority of sites do offer RSS feeds. Let's explore some quick ways to find them when a simple Google search isn't enough.

For instance, a substantial number of websites are built using WordPress, accounting for over 40% of the web. This means there's a high likelihood that the website you're visiting is a WordPress site, and they typically offer easily discoverable RSS feeds.

To find a WordPress RSS feed, just add "/feed" to the end of the URL. For instance, [https://justinpot.com/feed](https://justinpot.com/feed). This method works in most cases and is my go-to approach for finding RSS feeds.

If this doesn't yield results, here are a few additional tricks to try on other types of sites:

- For sites hosted on Tumblr, append "/rss" to the URL. For example: [https://example.tumblr.com/rss](https://example.tumblr.com/rss).


-  On Blogger-hosted sites, tack on "feeds/posts/default" to the end of the URL. For example: [example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default](https://example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default).

- If a publication is on Medium, insert "/feed/" before the publication's name. So, [medium.com/example-site](http://medium.com/example-site) becomes [medium.com/feed/example-site](https://medium.com/feed/example-site).

- YouTube channel pages can serve as RSS feeds. Just copy and paste the channel's URL into your RSS reader.

- You can also find an OPML file containing all your subscriptions there.


If none of these methods proves successful, you can resort to checking a webpage's source code. Don't worry, it's simpler than it sounds.

Right-click on an empty space on the website where you'd like to find an RSS feed, then select "View Page Source" (the phrasing might vary slightly depending on your browser).

Next, search the code by pressing Ctrl+F (Windows, Linux) or Command+F (Mac). Start with a search for "RSS," like so:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155009129927/original/E-aWIuKCArOaEVdeLiyQ6BYp4knhkShqBg.png?1696343865)

If "rss" doesn't yield results, try "atom" instead. Look for an RSS URL, as shown above, then copy and paste it into your feed reader. Happy feed hunting!

## **How to Create Posts using RSS Feed?**

Set up an RSS-to-social flow in Social Planner so new items from your feed auto-publish to your connected channels on a schedule.

### **Step 1:** Navigate to RSS Post

Navigate to Marketing > Social Planner. Click on "New Post", and there will be an option to select the "RSS Post"

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055530308/original/5VhD97g5_Szhterlz__FtrJ376EpFXCArQ.png?1759931805)            **Step 2**: Add URL

Add the URL of RSS Feed \[ Check above how to find the RSS URL\]

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055530397/original/r74SRDYcQY8YaRXdHxj0HqwzqehXk-eIaQ.png?1759931858)            **Step 3:** Select Socials

Select the socials where you would like to post.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055530476/original/ydivUWdrc8GOie_nxrvH9YjPdWH1mr1-5g.png?1759931909)            **Step 4:** Add Ending

You can add "End with" option to append any text, hashtags or links.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155009129941/original/TCrkq5xczfBJj_Jd50Tnhre6DNXqHydE1w.png?1696343867)      **Step 5:** Update Time

Select the option to update the feed update - from every 5 mins to once a day

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055530694/original/xy91wt151AQcaqv7nD2aOHnGc_xna0F4oA.png?1759932027)

### **Step 6:** Select Maximum Posts

- Select how many unique posts should be fetched from your RSS feed each time it checks for new content (minimum 1 to maximum 5).

- For example, if you choose '3', the system will pull up to the 3 most recent items from the RSS feed at the time of posting.

- This does not mean the same post will be published multiple times. Each fetched item will be published once as its own social post.
