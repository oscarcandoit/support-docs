# **What is Copy Workflow Actions Across Workflows?**

Copying actions between workflows lets you **duplicate existing steps**—either a single action or a sequence—into another workflow in the same sub-account. This accelerates building, reduces repetitive configuration, and helps maintain consistent automation standards across projects.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Copy Workflow Actions Between Workflows**

- **Speed:** Paste preconfigured steps in seconds instead of rebuilding from scratch.

- **Multi-paste window:** Reuse copied actions across multiple workflows during the **15-minute** clipboard window.

- **Consistency:** Keep naming, settings, and logic uniform across workflows to reduce errors.

- **Cross-tab convenience:** Copy in one tab and paste in another without losing your place.

- **Same sub-account scope:** Ensure compatibility because assets exist in the same environment.

- **Lower error risk:** Start from proven steps and tweak only what’s unique.

## **How To Use Copy** **Workflow** **Actions Between Workflows**

These steps outline where to click and how to paste efficiently so you can reuse existing logic with minimal rework.

**Step 1:** Open **Automation → Workflows : to find the Copy Option Feature**

Select your source workflow, and locate the action you want to reuse. Click the action’s three-dot menu and choose Copy Action (single step) or Copy All Actions From Here (selects a block starting at that action).

**Step 2:** Navigate to your **target workflow** (same tab or a different tab within the same sub-account).

To paste, **either:**

Click **Quick Paste** next to the **+** button where you add new actions

**OR** Open any action’s **three-dot** menu and choose **Paste Below**.

**Step 3**: Review the pasted actions to confirm assets and logic are correct, then **Save** your workflow.

* * *

## **Clipboard & Retention Rules**

- Copied actions remain available to paste for **15 minutes**.

- You can paste multiple times during the retention window—even into different workflows within the same sub-account.

- When the window expires, the paste options will no longer insert the copied content; copy again to continue working.

- Navigating between tabs is supported; just ensure you remain signed in and within the same sub-account.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I copy multiple actions at once?**

Yes. Use **Copy All Actions From Here** to copy a block starting at the selected action.

**Q: Can I paste in another tab?**

Yes. Copy in one tab and paste in another tab within the same sub-account during the **15-minute** window.

**Q: Are triggers copied?**

No. Copying actions doesn’t include triggers. Use trigger duplication tools when you need to reuse triggers.

**Q: Will asset references (emails, forms, calendars) carry over?**

If those assets exist in the same sub-account, the references persist. Always review after pasting.

**Q: How long are copied actions available?**

**15 minutes.** You can paste multiple times during this window without copying again.

**Q: Can I undo a paste?**

Before saving, you can delete or move the pasted actions. Confirm placement and settings, then save.

**Q: Does this work across sub-accounts?**

No. Action copy works **within the same sub-account**. For cross-sub-account needs, see the related article on copying entire workflows.
