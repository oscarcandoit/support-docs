# How to manage developer user accounts?

Modified on: Tue, 21 May, 2024 at 1:43 PM

In this guide, we'll explain how to manage users within your developer account using our Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This feature allows you to add users to your marketplace account and assign them appropriate roles with specific permissions.

## **Understanding Roles and Permissions**

Our RBAC system categorises developer users into three roles: Owner, Admin, and User. Each role has a distinct set of permissions to ensure appropriate access levels within your developer account.

### **Roles and Their Permissions:**

**Owner:**

- **The initial user who signs up is designated as the Owner.**

- **Only one Owner per account.**

- **Full access to all features and settings.**

- **Cannot transfer ownership.**


**Admin:**

- **Similar to the Owner but cannot modify the Owner's details.**

- **Can manage other Admins and Users.**


**User:**

- **Restricted access compared to Admins and Owners.**

- **Limited to certain actions as detailed below.**


### **Maximum allowed permissions for each role:**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Permission** | **Owner** | **Admin** | **User** |
| **View apps** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| **Create and manage apps** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| **Delete apps** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** |
| **Submit for review** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| **View app earnings** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** |
| **Create & manage users** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** |
| **View app dashboard** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
