# Gamification - Points, Badges and Leaderboard

Modified on: Thu, 23 May, 2024 at 4:22 AM

Welcome to the new Gamification and Leaderboard feature by Highlevel Community! The gamification features of community makes participating inside a group more fun and engaging. Point earning creates a progression system that encourages users to produce quality content and interact with other members of their community.

## **Setting up Gamification**

Gamification levels are **pre-defined.** Maximum levels are set to 9.

- As a group admin, user can edit the Level Names. To do this, go to Settings > Gamification & Rewards > Gamification > Click to edit the relevant level name.
- Make sure to hit the SAVE button.

## **How do levels and points work?**

Points are earned when others like your posts, comments, and replies. 1 like = 1 point for the post or comment author.

**Number of points required to reach a certain level:**

Level 1 -

0 points

Level 2 -

5 points

Level 3 -

20 points

Level 4 -

65 points

Level 5 -

155 points

Level 6 -

515 points

Level 7 -

2015 points

Level 8 -

8015 points

Level 9 -

33015 points

**After reaching a level:**

- **A member's profile badge will reflect their current level.**
- **Users can accordingly see the points required to reach the next level**
- **The circular progress bar is completed after a level is reached**

**Note that the member levels are at the group level. A member at level 3 will be at that level in that particular group. If they join another group, they will start at level 1, like all new members.**

Users can also view leaderboards for the group they are currently in to see how their levels stacks up against other members. This will give a preview of which courses unlock at certain levels as well as the custom level names for each group.

You can find members who earned the highest points in the past **7 days, 30 days, and overall.**

## **Rewards**

- Rewards - Group admins/ owners can choose to add offline rewards as texts. Maximum 3 rewards can be added. Example - Win $50 after reaching level 5.
- To add a reward (as an admin), go to Settings > Gamification & Rewards > Rewards.
- Once Rewards are added, they are reflected on the left nav bar inside the Leaderboard Tab.

_Note that rewards cannot be linked to any gamification level as of now. All rewards added need to be managed offline._
