# **What is Tabular View for Sub-Accounts List?**

Tabular View transforms the Sub-Accounts page from a Card layout into a spreadsheet-style table. Each sub-account is displayed as a row, while columns surface details like Name, Status, Creation Date, Plan, and more. Agency users can flip between Card and Table layouts at any time, giving them the flexibility to scan high-level info or dive into sortable data when precision matters. Tabular view gives Agency Owners the ability to using Sorting and filtering to quickly locate specific Sub-Accounts, saving valuable time.

## **Key Benefits of Tabular View for the Sub-Accounts List**

- **Centralized Visibility:** See every sub-account in a single, scrollable grid.

- **Operational Efficiency:** Sorting and filtering allow Agency Owners to quickly locate specific Sub-Accounts, saving valuable time.

- **Flexibility:** Choose between visual or structured layouts depending on your workflow.

- **Scalable Management:** Whether you manage 5 or 500 locations, the grid stays quick to scan and interact with.

- **Data-Driven Insights:** With structured visibility, Agency Owners can identify trends, spot anomalies, and make smarter decisions across their client base.

## **Switching Between Card View and Tabular View**

HighLevel offers two interchangeable layouts on the Sub-Accounts page:

- Card View: Best for visual snapshots (logos, quick stats).

- Tabular View: Best for data comparison, bulk edits, and sorting.


To change between views, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Sub-Accounts

From the Agency-View dashboard,  navigate to the Sub-Accounts page.

#### **Step 2:** Change Layout

Use the layout button (Switch to Card/Table View) in the upper-right corner of the Sub-Accounts page to switch instantly. Your last-used view is remembered per user, so you always return to your preferred workflow.

## **Sorting and Filtering Sub-Accounts in Tabular View**

Using the **A-Z**/ **Z-A** dropdown, you are able to choose between alphabetical and reverse alphabetical order.

**Q: Does switching to Tabular View affect my data?**
