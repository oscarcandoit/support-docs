## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I embed multiple different review widgets on one website?**

Yes, but not using the "Review" block in the builder, which always displays your default widget. To embed multiple widgets in the same site, use the “Embed Code” option to copy the code for the desired widget. Then add the widget's code to your website using a "Code" block. Make sure you are using the dropdown to select the correct widget when copying the code. Repeat this for each widget you would like to add to the site.

**Q: W** **ill my widget update automatically when I receive new reviews?**

Yes. The widget syncs with connected platforms such as Google and Facebook. New reviews will automatically appear in the widget based on the filters and display settings you've configured.

**Q: Do review widgets work on non-HighLevel websites?**

Yes. Review widgets can be embedded on almost any website platform. Simply copy the Embed Code from the widget and paste it into a custom code block on your external site.

**Q: Can I continue editing a widget after I add it to a site?**

Yes. You can edit the widget at any time—even after it's embedded. Changes you make in the widget builder (like layout, content, or styling) will automatically update on your site once you save the widget.

**Q: Are the review widgets mobile responsive?**

Absolutely. All review widget templates and layouts are fully responsive and automatically optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.
