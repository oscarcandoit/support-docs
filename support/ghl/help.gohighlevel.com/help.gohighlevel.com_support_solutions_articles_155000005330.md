# How to Create Services?

Modified on: Thu, 11 Sep, 2025 at 3:08 PM

Services helps you create bookable services so customers can self-schedule online with confidence. Use variations to present multiple options under a single service, add-ons to increase order value, and resources to prevent conflicts. This article walks through accessing the Services panel, organizing services with categories and creating a new service.

# **What are Services?**

Services is where you define what your business offers to clients, like coaching sessions, spa treatments, or fitness programs. It helps you create service listings that customers can book online while keeping things organized behind the scenes.

You can manage how and when services are offered, who provides them, and enhance them with optional **add-ons**, **resource management**, and **categories**. Services support both simple bookings and advanced business flows such as:

- Multi-location scheduling

- Service variations (e.g., different durations or price tiers)

- Upsells with add-ons

- Deposit payments


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Creating Services**

Knowing what each feature does makes setup faster and keeps your booking page accurate. The benefits below reflect options you configure directly when creating or editing a service:

- **Variations:** Offer multiple options (such as different lengths or tiers) within a single service, each with its own duration and price

- **Add-ons:** Present optional extras during checkout that can increase the price of the booking

- **Resources:** Reserve limited items (like rooms or stations) so they aren’t double-booked

- **Processing Time & Buffers:** Build realistic gaps and in-service timing to support smooth scheduling

- **Staff & Availability:** Assign team members to the service and manage their working hours

- **Categories:** Group services and control the order shown on the booking page

- **Private Service:** Hide specific services from the public list when you only want to share them directly

- **Custom URL & Preview:** Share a clean link and verify the booking experience before promoting it

- **Deposits & Pricing:** Collect a deposit at booking and manage your pricing settings


* * *

## **How to Access the Services Panel**

The Services Panel is the starting point for building, organizing, and previewing your booking experience. Within the Services Panel, you’ll find:

- A searchable and sortable list of all services

- An option to create new services

- Each service’s name, duration, price, and assigned staff

- Categories displayed on the left for easy organization

- A three-dot menu with actions: Edit, Duplicate, Delete, or Share

- A View Booking Page link for customer-facing access


To access your list of services in the Services Panel, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Calendars** tab on the left navigation bar

2. Select **Calendar Settings** from the top navigation ribbon

3. Choose the **Services** tabfrom the top navigation ribbon on the Calendar Settings page

* * *

## **Creating and Managing Categories**

Service categories serve as a way to group similar or relevant services, making it easier for customers to navigate your offerings. These categories are displayed on the booking page, under which specific services are listed.

- Click the **\+ New Category** button to create a new category

- Use the **three-dot (⋮) icon** to edit a category

- Drag categories to rearrange them; the order is reflected in the booking page layout

* * *

## **Service Management Features**

Use the service editor to edit and update existing features. To open the editor, click the **three-dot (⋮) icon** next to the service within the Services Panel and choose **Edit**. The Service Editor includes:

- **Service Details:** Staff, duration, buffer times, processing, variations, pricing, payments, deposits

- **Add-Ons:** Upsell or enhance services with extras

- **Resources:** Assign rooms, chairs, or other assets required for the service


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053195733/original/IXCx7zTww4I0Vpf_veiiL1h7A98S2-wMvQ.png?1757092032)

* * *

## **What are Add-ons?**

Add-ons let you enhance services by offering optional extras that customers can book alongside their main service. They’re perfect for upselling additional features (like massage oils, treatments, or accessories) and for giving customers the ability to personalize their appointments. Add-ons can be customer-facing on the booking page or used internally by staff when creating appointments.

### **How Add-ons Appear on the Booking Page**

- Customer-facing add-ons display as optional checkboxes when booking a service

- The add-on price and/or duration is added to the total booking cost

- Hidden add-ons will not appear for customers but can be selected by staff inside the appointment modal


### **Accessing Add-ons**

1. Navigate to the Services Panel ( **Calendar** \> **Calendar** **Settings** \> **Services**)

2. Open the Service Editor for the selected service ( **Three-dot (⋮)** \> **Edit**) and click the **Add-ons** tab

3. Here you’ll see a list of add-ons linked to the selected service, along with their Price, Duration, and Maximum Quantity

4. From this tab, you can create new Add-ons or edit existing ones

[Click here for more information about Add-ons, including how to create and edit them](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003506)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053196384/original/tVczpEVTqXC1V5I3_eqojPVhMuk3ZFEMpw.png?1757092752)

* * *

## **What are Resources?**

Resources are shared assets like rooms, chairs, stations, or tools that must be available for a service to take place. Assigning resources to services helps prevent double bookings and ensures accurate capacity management.

Each resource can be linked to one or more services and configured by:

- Location: Assign where each resource is available

- Capacity: Set how many appointments or people the resource can accommodate


For example, a "Room 1" resource might be used by several services but can only support 4 people at a time. You can specify this capacity per location for granular control.

### **Accessing Resources**

1. Navigate to the Services Panel ( **Calendar** \> **Calendar** **Settings** \> **Services**)

2. Open the Service Editor for the selected service ( **Three-dot (⋮)** \> **Edit**) and click the **Resources** tab

3. Here you’ll see a list of Resources, along with their Total Capacity, Services Associated, Locations Associated and Status

4. From this tab, you can create new Resources or edit existing ones

[Click here for more information about resources, including how to create and edit them](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003505)

- Click the **\+ New Service** button in the upper right corner

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053200512/original/JllFIQ5or4T6MV8J87DSZJtJpDmKe_tX2Q.png?1757099763)

#### **Step 2:** Add Basic Details

- Fill in the basic details for the service. These details include:




  - **Service Image:** Upload an image that visually represents your service

  - **Service Name:** The title of the service shown to customers

  - **Service Color:** Assign a color to help identify this service in the calendar

  - **Category:** Place the service under a relevant category (a new service will automatically be added to the default category if none selected)

  - **Custom URL:** Set a unique booking link for the service

  - **Description:** Add a brief summary of what the service offers

  - **Private Service:** Hide this service from public booking pages. New bookings may only be scheduled internally via the platform

  - **Staff Members:** Assign staff who can provide this service. At least one staff member must be assigned for the service to be bookable

  - **Duration:** Add how long the service will last
- Once all basic details have been added, click **Advanced Settings** to configure additional service details


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053200602/original/EOd3sNb1Xewc8sHwRzixDd5zAmDfVlTIWw.png?1757100099)

#### **Step 3:** Configure Service Details

- **Duration:** Set how long the service lasts

- **Processing Time:** Break down duration into three phases (Initial, Processing, Final). Staff are only booked during Initial/Final phases, and remain available for other appointments during the Processing phase

- **Buffer Time:** Add time before or after the appointment for prep or cleanup


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053200659/original/3SudWPP0pe6TcJ3z9FBQS9RJcEcPyyolmQ.png?1757100317)

#### **Step 4:** Set Up Payments

- **Price:** Enter the price customers will pay

- **Partial Payments:** Allow customers to pay a deposit instead of full payment. Choose between fixed amount or percentage


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053200704/original/Q1UOse8gPASRMJNB-W_Hn8cvzePFg1KUqw.png?1757100437)

#### **Step 5:** Configure Variations (Optional)

Enable **Variations** to offer multiple options under one service (e.g., different durations, or pricing).

- Add each variation’s **Name**, **Duration**, **Price**, and **Processing Time**(if any)

- Example:




  - 30 mins – $120

  - 45 mins – $100

  - 60 mins – $350

#### **Step 6:** Save & Preview

- Click **Save Changes** to apply updates

- Use **View Booking Page** to preview how customers will see the service

## **Best Practices**

- Assign Staff and configure their availability to every service for them to be bookable

- Organize services meaningfully into categories

- Leverage Add Ons for upsells and custom options

- Use Resources to prevent over-utilization and optimize availability of linked resources

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I hide a service from the public booking page?**

Yes. Enable "This is a private service" for the service and share the direct link instead. When this is turned on, the service will not be shown on the public booking page.

**Q: How do categories impact the booking page?**

Category assignment and order determine how services are grouped and displayed in the public booking page. Please be aware that changing the order of the categories in the editor will change the order on the booking page.

**Q: What’s the difference between processing time and buffers?**

Processing time is part of the appointment when the service is still in progress. Buffers are extra time added before or after the appointment to space out bookings (useful for setting up before or cleaning after an appointment).
