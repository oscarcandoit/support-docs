## Overview

The **Trigger Link Clicked** trigger initiates a workflow whenever a specific trigger link is clicked by a contact. This feature is ideal for tracking link engagement and automating subsequent actions based on user interactions with predefined links.

## Trigger Name

**Trigger Link Clicked**

## Trigger Description

This trigger starts a workflow when a contact clicks on a specified trigger link. Trigger links can be used in emails, SMS, or other communication channels. The workflow is activated only for the contacts who click the specified link, making it a powerful tool for targeted engagement.

## How to Configure

- **Choose a Workflow Trigger**: Select **Trigger Link Clicked** from the list of available triggers.

- **Workflow Trigger Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your trigger, such as "Promo Link Clicked" or "Survey Link Engagement."

- **Filters**: Use filters to specify which trigger link will activate the workflow. You can select the exact trigger link from the dropdown menu to narrow down the workflow activation.
