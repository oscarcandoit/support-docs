Great idea.

Question: Why not have a new input box that says, individual commission (overrides default product commission)... It's very confusing to overwrite it on a public commission box.

Managing affiliate commissions effectively is key to motivating affiliates and driving the success of your program. The **Affiliate-Level Commission Settings** feature allows you to set **custom commission rates** for individual affiliates within a campaign. This offers a flexible, targeted approach to commission management, letting you reward top performers by overriding default campaign-level settings.

This feature ensures precise control over commission payouts, helping you boost performance and keep your affiliates motivated.

## **Key Features and Use Cases**

With Affiliate-Level Commission Settings, you can:

- **Set Custom Commission Rates**: Override the default campaign commission for individual affiliates.
- **Manage Tiered Commissions**: Adjust commission rates for multi-tiered campaigns.
- **Reward High Performers**: Offer higher commissions to top-performing affiliates without affecting the rest of the campaign.

* * *

## **Example Use Case:**

Let’s say your default campaign offers a **40% commission** to all affiliates. However, you have an affiliate who consistently drives **high-value sales**, and you want to offer them a higher rate. Using this feature, you can easily set a **50% commission** for that affiliate without changing the overall campaign settings, allowing you to reward their exceptional performance.

* * *

## **Steps to Configure Affiliate-Level Commission Settings**

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Sub Account Affiliate Manager**

Log in to your CRM and go to the **Sub Account Affiliate Manager** section.

### **Step 2: Select the Affiliate**

Find and select the affiliate for whom you want to set a custom commission rate. This will take you to the affiliate's profile page.

### **Step 3: Choose the Campaign**

Scroll down to the **Active Referral Link** section and click **Customize** next to the campaign where you want to adjust the commission settings.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033805612/original/dwdFgJt6PKfmqejzB3ELanBiWRDFlfVjqg.jpeg?1727703780)

### **Step 4: Configure Affiliate-Level Commissions**

- Switch to the **Commissions** tab.
- Enter the custom commission rate for that affiliate.
- If the campaign is **multi-tiered**, configure the commission rates for each tier.
- You can adjust both **Default Commissions** and **Product-Based Commissions** as needed.
- Save your changes.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033805611/original/q0WQRAHCQ29X9HOOPm1pRc_sH1SHgYuJ3A.jpeg?1727703780)


* * *

### **Important Notes**

- **Precedence**: Affiliate-level commission settings always take priority over campaign-level settings during commission calculations.
- **Tier Management**: Tiers cannot be changed within the affiliate profile settings. To adjust tiers, you must modify the campaign settings.
- **Support**: Currently, this feature is supported only for affiliate campaigns where the source is a funnel or website.

* * *

This feature ensures that you can offer customized incentives, ensuring your top performers remain engaged and motivated. By managing commissions at an affiliate level, you can fine-tune your reward system without affecting your overall campaign structure.
