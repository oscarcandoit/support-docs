# **What are Unsubscribe Flows?**

Unsubscribe flows define what happens after a recipient clicks an unsubscribe link in your emails. In HighLevel, you can choose between One Step, Two Step, and Dynamic options to reduce accidental opt‑outs, protect against automated bot clicks, and keep your program compliant while maintaining a smooth experience.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Configurable Unsubscribe Flows**

Selecting the right flow helps strike a balance between deliverability, compliance, and user experience.

- **Compliance & Control:** Ensure a reliable opt‑out process while tailoring the experience to your audience

- **Bot‑Click Protection:** Dynamic adds verification when risk signals are present, limiting bot‑triggered opt‑outs

- **Fewer Accidental Opt‑Outs:** A confirmation step (Two-Step) or time‑based checks (Dynamic) reduce unintended unsubscribes

- **Simple Configuration:** Quickly and easily change the selected flow within the Email Marketing Settings Panel

- **Works at Scale:** Flow selection applies across all campaigns in account, removing the need to update each email campaign individually

* * *

## **Unsubscribe Flow Options**

Selecting the right unsubscribe flow balances compliance, deliverability, and user experience. The summaries below explain how each option works so you can pick the best flow for you.

#### **One-Step Flow**

Contacts are instantly unsubscribed with a single click, followed by the option to provide feedback. This provides a frictionless experience, reducing complaints and spam reports from frustrated users.

#### **Two-Step Flow**

Contacts must confirm their email before being unsubscribed. This adds a layer of confirmation to reduce accidental opt-outs, especially for high-value or engaged lists.

#### **Dynamic Flow**(Recommended Option)

Dynamic unsubscribe combines 'Two Step' and 'One Step' unsubscribe flows. Unsubscribe will be immediate (One Step) unless the contact is unsubscribing within 5 minutes of email delivery or the contact is less than 1 hour old, then confirmation is required (Two Step). This balances ease-of-use with protection against bots and accidental opt-outs.

## **Customizing Unsubscribe Link**

You can change how the unsubscribe link looks without changing the flow you’ve chosen. To edit the unsubscribe link from the email settings panel, select _"How to customize the unsubscribe link"_  located under the flow selector section.

For detailed guidance on customizing your unsubscribe link, see our separate article: [Creating and Managing Custom Unsubscribe Links](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004799)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will changing unsubscribe settings affect contacts who unsubscribed before?**

No, changes only apply to emails sent after you update your settings; prior unsubscribe data remains unchanged.

**Q: What happens if a contact starts Two-Step but never confirms?**

The unsubscribe does not complete, and the contact remains subscribed until they confirm.

**Q: How do I safely test the Dynamic flow?** Send yourself a test email and click the link within 5 minutes of delivery, or use a brand‑new contact (created less than 1 hour ago). You should see an email verification prompt; normal clicks should unsubscribe instantly.

**Q: Does my selected flow apply to all emails campaigns?**

Yes. The flow is set at the account level. All emails sent from that account honor the current selection until you change it.

**Q: What are the different unsubscribe flows available?**

You can choose from One Step (instant unsubscribe), Two Step (email confirmation required), or Dynamic (smart confirmation for suspicious cases)
