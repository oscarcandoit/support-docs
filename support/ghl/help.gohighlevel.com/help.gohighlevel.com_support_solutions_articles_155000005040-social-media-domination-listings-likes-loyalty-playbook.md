### Why This Playbook Matters

You help clients find their dream homes or sell at top dollar—but are you showing up where buyers and sellers spend their time?

In 2025, social media isn’t optional it’s your **digital first impression**.

* * *

### Industry Metrics:

- 77% of real estate prospects research agents online before contacting

- 44% of buyers found their agent via **social media or online presence**

- Agents who post 3–5 times a week generate **4x more inquiries**


Yet most real estate businesses:

- Don’t post consistently

- Don’t use content that builds local authority

- Don’t automate follow-ups from social engagement


* * *

Social media = trust, visibility, and repeat business—when powered by a system like HighLevel.

> Want to grow your real estate brand and close more deals?

```
Start using HighLevel to automate, convert and grow.
```

* * *

### **What You’ll Learn**

✅ How to turn Facebook, Instagram & YouTube into lead machines

✅ What content attracts buyers, sellers & investors

✅ How to target homeowners, down-sizers, first-time buyers, and FSBOs

✅ How to automate posting, replies & follow-ups

✅ How to run affordable ads that generate warm leads fast

* * *

## Step 1: Build a Powerful Local Presence

### Why It Matters

Your next client is already online. If they can't find you—or trust you—another agent wins the listing.

* * *

### 1.1 Choose the Right Platforms for Real Estate

| Platform | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook | Local visibility, reviews, open house events |
| Instagram | Listings photos, stories, reels |
| LinkedIn | B2B referrals, investor networking |
| YouTube | Neighborhood tours, market updates |
| GBP (Google) | Reviews + contact hub + SEO for agents |

**Use Case:**

An agent in Denver posted weekly “Neighborhood Feature Friday” reels on IG & FB—within 60 days, they doubled inbound buyer leads from social.

* * *

## Step 2: Post Content That Sells You Without Selling

### Why It Matters

No one wants “Just Sold” spam all day. But smart, helpful, and human content builds your reputation and drives DM inquiries.

* * *

### 2.1 What to Post

| Content Type | Example Post |
| --- | --- |
| Property Spotlights | “Take a peek inside this renovated 3-bed in East Austin” |
| Buyer Education | “Top 3 things NOT to do before closing on your mortgage” |
| Seller Advice | “Why staging your home can increase sale price by up to 20%” |
| Behind the Scenes | “We just negotiated $15K off asking for our client ?” |
| Testimonials | “Here’s what Julie said after selling with us…” |
| Local Features | “Why people love living in \[Your Area\] — Top 5 walkable coffee spots” |

Content Rule: 80% value & engagement, 20% direct offers

* * *

### 2.2 Hashtag & Keyword Strategy

- **Instagram/Facebook**: #FirstTimeBuyer #JustListed #HomeGoals

- **LinkedIn**: #RealEstateMarketing #HomeSellingTips

- **Google Posts**: “\[City\] Realtor”, “Top Agent in \[Neighborhood\]”


**Tip:** Always tag your city & neighborhoods in captions for local SEO.

* * *

## Step 3: Use Smart Ads to Fill Your Pipeline

### Why It Matters

Only 5–10% of your followers see organic posts. Ads put your listings and value in front of the right people—fast.

* * *

### 3.1 High-Impact Ad Campaign Ideas

- Facebook Lead Ads: “Want to know what your home is worth in this market? Get your free report.”

- Instagram Reels Ads: Property walk-through with CTA to “Book a Tour”

- Retargeting Ads: Re-engage site visitors with a new listing or offer

- Google LSAs: For “top agents near me” and “sell my home \[city\]”


**Use Case:**

An agent in Sacramento spent $250 on FB ads promoting a “Get Your Free CMA” funnel—generated 9 seller leads and booked 4 listing consults in 10 days.

* * *

### 3.2 Targeting That Converts

- ZIP code + 10–15 mile radius

- Age: 30–65+

- Interests: Real estate, home improvement, moving soon, mortgage

- Custom audiences: Website visitors, past leads, Instagram engagers


* * *

### 3.3 Budget Recommendations

| Business Stage | Suggested Ad Spend |
| --- | --- |
| Solo Agent | $10/day ($300/month) |
| Small Team | $25/day ($750/month) |
| Multi-Agent Office | $50+/day ($1,500+/month) |

## Step 4: Automate to Scale with HighLevel

### Why It Matters

You’re out showing homes—not glued to your phone. HighLevel keeps your social, follow-ups, and lead nurturing running 24/7.

* * *

### 4.1 Pre-Schedule All Your Posts

✅ Use HighLevel’s Social Planner to schedule 3–5 posts/week

✅ Reuse past content for new audiences

✅ Mix educational, testimonial, and CTA content evenly

* * *

### 4.2 Auto-Reply to Comments & DMs

✅ Set up Conversation AI to instantly reply when someone DMs “Tour”, “Home Value”, or “Ready to Sell”

✅ Route hot leads to calendar bookings automatically

**Trigger Example:**

“DM us ‘TOUR’ to schedule a private showing today!”

* * *

### 4.3 Measure What Moves the Needle

✅ Track which posts get the most engagement

✅ See what leads convert into showings or listing appointments

✅ Optimize based on CPL (Cost per Lead) and CPA (Cost per Appointment)

* * *

## Final Thoughts: Dominate Social, One Post at a Time

You don’t need a viral video—you need consistency, trust, and automation.

✅ Be present where your buyers and sellers are

✅ Build your brand without burning out

✅ Turn your socials into a listing machine

* * *

### Your Next Steps:

✅ Set up and connect your social profiles in HighLevel

✅ Start posting 3–5x per week using this content framework

✅ Launch your first low-budget ad targeting seller leads

✅ Use automation to reply, follow up, and book appointments
