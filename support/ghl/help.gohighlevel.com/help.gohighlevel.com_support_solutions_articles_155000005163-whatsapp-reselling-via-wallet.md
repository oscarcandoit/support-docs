# **What is WhatsApp Reselling?**

**WhatsApp Reselling with Wallet Integration empowers agencies to offer WhatsApp subscriptions using wallet balances or Stripe.**

This feature upgrade allows customers without a Stripe connection to easily resell WhatsApp services, unlocking new markets and simplifying payment handling.

## **Key Benefits of WhatsApp Reselling**

**Offering flexible payment options helps you scale your business, improve customer satisfaction, and simplify operations.**

- **Expand your customer base** to include users who don’t use Stripe.

- **Increase revenue** by offering flexible purchasing options.

- **Simplify subscription management** with a unified dashboard.

- **Improve customer experience** with seamless wallet recharges.

- **Enhance transparency** with real-time webhook updates.

- **Prepare for future expansion** with support for additional resellable products.


## **How To Set Up WhatsApp Reselling**

**Setting up WhatsApp reselling with wallet support ensures a frictionless experience for both you and your customers.**

1. **Access Agency Settings**: Go to your Agency Dashboard.

## **Resell WhatsApp with Wallet Balance**

**Allowing wallet-based purchases removes payment provider limitations and increases customer accessibility.**

When wallet reselling is enabled, customers are given the option to pay using their wallet funds. If the wallet balance is insufficient, the system automatically prompts them to recharge, ensuring a smooth purchase journey without needing to exit the flow.

## **Seamless Wallet Integration**

**The wallet service now directly integrates with the paywall, delivering a frictionless checkout experience.**

The system automatically verifies the wallet balance before confirming a subscription purchase. If the balance is too low, customers can instantly recharge without restarting their purchase flow, leading to higher conversion rates and fewer abandoned transactions.

## **Unified Subscription Management**

**Manage all your WhatsApp subscriptions, regardless of payment method, from one centralized dashboard.**

Stripe and wallet-based subscriptions are now viewable in a single place, providing a simplified, consolidated view of all reselling activities. This eliminates the need to switch between multiple management screens.

## **Real-Time Transaction Updates**

**Stay fully informed with real-time webhook support for wallet subscription events.**

Webhook events notify you of important subscription changes, including:

- Wallet recharge initiated

- Subscription purchase successful

- Subscription renewal using wallet

- Recharge failure alerts


This ensures you are always aware of your customers’ transaction statuses without having to manually check dashboards.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can customers without Stripe accounts resell WhatsApp now?**

Yes! Wallet integration allows any customer to resell WhatsApp, even if Stripe is not connected.

**Q: What happens if a customer’s wallet balance is too low?**

The system prompts the user to recharge automatically before completing their purchase.

**Q: Can I track wallet-based transactions separately?**

While all transactions are shown in one dashboard, you can filter them by payment method to see wallet-only activity.

**Q: Will other products besides WhatsApp be supported soon?**

Yes, future plans include supporting wallet reselling for other HighLevel resellable products.

**Q: Is webhook setup mandatory for wallet reselling?**

Webhook setup is optional but highly recommended to get real-time updates and reduce manual monitoring.

**Q: How do automatic wallet recharges work?**

You set minimum balance thresholds and recharge amounts; when a wallet drops below the threshold during a purchase, the system automatically prompts a recharge.

### **Next Steps**

- Enable Wallet-Based WhatsApp Reselling in your SaaS v2 settings.

- Configure wallet recharge settings for optimal purchase flow.

- Set up webhook notifications to stay informed in real-time.

- Prepare to enable wallet reselling for additional products as new features roll out.
