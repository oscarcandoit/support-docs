## **What’s New**

- **Direct Instagram Integration**: Connect and schedule posts to Instagram directly—no Facebook Page needed.

- **Creator Account Support**: Auto-post Stories from Creator accounts.

- **Simplified Workflow**: Manage Posts, Stories, and Reels from HighLevel without extra Facebook permissions.


* * *

## **What is Direct Instagram Integration in Social Planner?**

Direct Instagram Integration is a new feature in HighLevel’s Social Planner that lets you connect your Instagram Business or Creator accounts and schedule content without linking a Facebook Page. This removes a major barrier, streamlines your process, and gives you a one-stop dashboard for Instagram management.

With this enhancement, you can:

- Auto-post Stories (including from Creator accounts)

- Schedule Posts, Stories, and Reels

- View engagement metrics directly in Social Planner


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Direct Instagram Integration**

- **No Facebook Page Needed**: Skip the Facebook connection step—grant only Instagram permissions.

- **Supports Creator & Business Accounts**: Full Stories and post scheduling for both account types.

- **Simplified Workflow**: One interface for all Instagram content—no extra apps or dashboards.

- **Quick Setup**: Guided connection in minutes.

- **Statistics Access**: Engagement data (likes, comments) visible; view counts for images/videos excluded by Instagram API.

- **Content Flexibility**: Schedule Posts, Stories, and Reels per Instagram guidelines.

- **Time Savings**: Fewer steps, fewer permissions—focus on content creation.


* * *

## **Before you begin**

#### ``` 1) Confirm that your Instagram profile is a Business or Creator profile.  - If you don’t have an Instagram Business or Creator profile, see Convert an Instagram Personal profile to a Business or Creator profile.  2) Confirm that you have an Admin or Editor Page role for the Facebook Page if it's a Classic Page type or Facebook access with full or partial control on a New Page type. See the Facebook help article. How do I see what my role is on a Facebook Page?  - If the Page is an asset in Facebook Business Manager, you also need management access to the Page in the Business Manager account. See the Facebook help article Add People to Your Business Manager. ```

* * *

## **Method 1: Facebook-Linked Integration (Classic)**

```
IMPORTANT: This method is required if you need legacy features that still rely on Facebook permissions.

This is a requirement from Facebook (which owns Instagram).
