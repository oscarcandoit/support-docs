First Steps to Take Once You Become a HighLevel Affiliate

Congratulations! You are a HighLevel affiliate!

As an affiliate, you will make a 40% commission on every referral you bring in that signs on to HighLevel. You can make a commission on every HighLevel subscription plan, including the Starter $97 plan, $297 Agency Freelancer plan, and the $497 Agency Pro plan. Those are called Tier 1 referrals. You will also earn an additional 5% for Your Tier 2referrals, which your original client brings in.

This is a great way to bring in extra income, and you were probably already talking about HighLevel before you even became an affiliate, so why not make some extra cash while you do?

So now that you are officially a HighLevel affiliate, this article will walk you through the first things you should do once you set up your affiliate account or send out your first referral link!

# Step 1: Log in to First Promoter

First Promoter is an affiliate and referrals tracking system for SaaS and subscription services. Their website description states, “FirstPromoter is an all-in-one platform that allows SaaS companies to track, manage and optimize any type of referral-based marketing programs.”

To access your account go to [gohighlevel.firstpromoter.com](http://gohighlevel.firstpromoter.com/)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48101121989/original/cRlpS_WkKwH_29gxwN9XLFcOTRYizLfKEw.png?1619723972)

This is where you will manage and track all of your affiliate work. You can see who has clicked on your link, your earnings, customers, and more.

## Make sure you have Tipalti set up!

If you have an active HighLevel agency, you can set up Tipalti in your [**affiliate portal.**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001202637)

If you are an affiliate for HighLevel and do not have an active HighLevel subscription, please get in touch with supportto receive a Tipalti setup link[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48281369898/original/EsOMgNqWY0WOwBBvFokLupZDJYjuEqfcWQ.png?1676316705)](https://suppliers.tipalti.com/highlevel/Account/Login)

If you already have a Tipalti account and need to log in. Click the image above!

# Step 2: Get Familiar with the First Promoter Dashboard

When you go to your dashboard, you can see how many customers, referrals, clicks, and unpaid earnings you have.

You will be able to follow through and look at everyone you’ve brought onto the platform, who is still a lead.

You will also be able to view everyone your customers have brought on in the Sub-affiliates tab.

You will also be able to track your referrals, your rewards, and more.

On the first promoter title tab click on the “Assets” tab. This gives you access to all of the marketing assets that HighLevel provides to affiliates.

# Now that You’ve Finished the First Couple of Steps, What’s Next?

You should get to know the HighLevel platform and bring on those first few affiliates to your account.
