## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do Calendar and Appointments differ?**

Use **Calendar View** for a visual schedule and overlaps; use **Appointments List View** for per‑listing rows, payments, and quick actions.

**Q: What’s the difference between Listings and Categories?**

A **listing** is a rentable item. A **category** groups listings and influences how they’re organized on the booking page.

**Q: Do global changes affect existing bookings?**

Most settings apply to **new** bookings going forward. Existing bookings and issued invoices typically remain unchanged.

**Q: Where do I edit pricing if totals look off?**

Adjust rules on the listing’s **Pricing** tab (see **Pricing & Discounts**) and re‑test.

**Q: How do external calendars affect availability?**

Imported events block time; exports share your availability. Use **Refresh** in a listing’s **Calendar Sync** to force an update.
