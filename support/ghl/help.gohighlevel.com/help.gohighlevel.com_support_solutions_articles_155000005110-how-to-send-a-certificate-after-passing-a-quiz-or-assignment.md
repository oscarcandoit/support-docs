# How to Send a Certificate After Passing a Quiz or Assignment

Modified on: Thu, 29 May, 2025 at 10:22 AM

You can automatically issue a certificate when a learner completes (passes) a quiz or an assignment in your course. Follow the steps below to configure this using the **Workflow Builder**.

## **✅ Overview**

This guide walks you through setting up an automation that triggers the issuance of a certificate once a user completes a specific quiz or assignment in your course. You’ll use the **Lesson Completed** trigger with filters and then add an **Issue Certificate** action.

## **⚙️ Step-by-Step Instructions**

### 1\. **Add the Trigger**

- In your workflow, click **Add Trigger**.

- Choose **Lesson Completed**.


### 2\. **Apply Filters**

To issue the certificate only for the intended quiz or assignment, apply the following filters:

- **Product** → _Select your Course_

- **Category** → _Choose the module/section where your quiz lives_

- **Lesson** → _Select the specific quiz or assignment_

### 3\. **Add the Certificate Action**

- Click the **+** icon under the trigger.

- Select **Issue Certificate** from the list of actions.

- Select the **certificate template** of your choice.


You’re done! The system will now automatically send a certificate when the selected quiz/assignment is passed.
