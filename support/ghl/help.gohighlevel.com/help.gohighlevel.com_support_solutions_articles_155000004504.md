# Documents & Contracts: How to Automate Collection of Payments at the Time of Signing

Modified on: Tue, 21 Jan, 2025 at 6:57 AM

## What's New?

We are excited to introduce **Recurring Invoice Generation** integrated directly into our 2-in-1 Documents & Contracts feature. This enhancement allows users to automate the creation and management of recurring invoices seamlessly at the time of document signing. Key updates include:

- **Automated Settings Drawer:** When adding a product list to a new template or document, clicking the product list automatically opens the settings drawer for easy configuration.

- **Automatic Recurring Type Assignment:** Adding a recurring product changes its type to recurring automatically.
- **Price Type Tags:** Visual tags indicate whether a product is one-time or recurring, helping users differentiate between pricing types.

- **Flexible Invoice Scheduling:** Users can now choose to generate invoices immediately upon signing or based on a fixed schedule relative to the signing date.

## How to Use

### For Templates

1. **Create a New Template:**

   - Navigate to **Payments** \> **Documents & Contracts** \> **Templates** \> **New Template**.

     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040192695/original/_2f8RiHPRq3Ck-IfTr1HmJdOpvMFgpdAOQ.png?1737463746)
2. **Add a Product List and Signature:**

   - Add a product list to your template.
   - Insert a signature element where required.

3. **Configure Recurring Products:**

   - Add a recurring product to the product list.
   - The settings drawer will automatically open for configuration.

     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040192818/original/XWkZ94CHm5lsYqgW7teiPASepCzdpa3rMA.png?1737463823)
4. **Distinguish Product Types:**

   - The product list will display distinctions between one-time and recurring products.
   - **Note:**
     - **One-Time Products:** Always treated as one-time payments.
     - **Recurring Products with Setup Fee:** Displayed as two line items—one for the recurring payment and another for the one-time setup fee.
     - Only recurring products will be billed in subsequent invoices sent

### Configuring Recurring Invoice settings within the product list

1. **Generate Invoice at Signing:**

   - **Toggle On:** Creates a recurring invoice schedule with the first invoice generated at the time of signing. Subsequent invoices follow the defined frequency (e.g., monthly).
     - _Example:_ If a document is signed on January 25th with a monthly schedule, the next invoice is sent on February 25th.
   - **Toggle Off:** Allows users to set a specific date for the invoice to be sent, regardless of the signing date.
2. **Enable Direct Payment:**

   - **Toggle On:** Redirects the primary signer directly to the invoice page after signing and sends an email with the invoice.
   - **Toggle Off:** The invoice is saved as a draft and can be sent manually later.

### Workflow Configuration

1. **Save the Template:**

   - After configuring, save your template.

     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040192893/original/-3UIQsdRELaPte1YEzcXcntWdBZGqKdhxg.png?1737463897)
2. **Configure Workflow:**

   - Go to **Workflows** and set up a new workflow using the saved template.

     ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040192926/original/trhoweVKEWsarS92L9_mLcX6oECFxCQrFg.png?1737463916)
3. **Send and Complete:**

   - Once the workflow is triggered, the signer receives the document with the attached invoice.
   - After signing, the primary signer is redirected to the invoice for immediate payment. An email with the invoice is also sent as a backup.

4. **Track Payments:**

   - Monitor payments through the **Documents** section or the **Invoices** section.

## Why We Built It

Our goal was to **simplify the contract signing and payment process** by integrating recurring invoice generation directly into Document & Contract workflows.
