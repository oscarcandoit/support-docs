## What is the Certificates Feature?

The Certificates feature in HighLevel enables you to design, issue, and manage certificates for contacts who complete courses or achieve defined milestones. Certificates can be customized with dynamic fields such as the recipient’s name, course name, and date of completion. Once configured, certificates can be delivered automatically through workflows or issued manually.

## Key Benefits of the Certificates Feature

The updated Certificates feature introduces several improvements that increase usability, flexibility, and professional presentation.

- Publicly shareable certificates with unique URLs

- Direct sharing capabilities to LinkedIn, Facebook, X (Twitter), and WhatsApp

- High-resolution image downloads that preserve design integrity

- Fast and reliable downloads, with certificates pre-generated at issuance

- Fully responsive display across desktop and mobile devices

- Seamless integration with workflows for automated certificate delivery


## How to Use the Certificates Feature

Understanding how to configure and issue certificates effectively allows you to recognize users at scale and maintain a professional presentation.

1. Navigate to Sites → Memberships → Certificates

2. Click \+ New Certificate or select an existing certificate to edit

3. Customize your certificate using the available design tools and dynamic fields

4. Associate the certificate with a course or workflow as needed

5. Preview the final design and test the issuance process

6. Issue certificates manually or through automated workflows


## Shareable Certificates

The new sharing functionality allows users to promote their accomplishments through direct links and social media integration, enhancing both engagement and brand reach.

Each certificate now includes a unique public link that can be used to:

- Share on professional and social platforms including LinkedIn, Facebook, X (Twitter), and WhatsApp

- Copy and paste into websites, portfolios, or emails

- View without requiring login credentials


### Steps to Share a Certificate:

1. Go to Sites → Memberships → Certificates

2. Locate and select the issued certificate

3. Click on Share Certificate

4. Choose a platform for direct sharing or click Copy Link to manually distribute the URL


These capabilities allow recipients to showcase their achievements while simultaneously promoting your programs to a broader audience.

## Optimized Certificate Download Flow

Recent updates to the download process ensure that certificates are more accessible, visually consistent, and easier to distribute.

### Enhancements Include:

- Certificates are now downloaded as high-quality PNG images

- Image files maintain the exact format and layout of the original certificate design

- All certificates are pre-generated at the time of issuance, significantly reducing download wait times

- Files are compatible with all major devices and screen sizes, including mobile and tablet


These improvements eliminate prior formatting issues and simplify the process of storing, sharing, or printing certificates.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Are certificates still available as PDFs?

No. Certificates are now provided in image format (PNG) to ensure better compatibility and visual accuracy across platforms.

Q: Can anyone view a certificate via a shareable link?

Yes. Shared certificates are publicly accessible via a unique link. However, they are not searchable or indexed.

Q: Can I disable the public sharing feature?

At this time, all certificates include public share links by default. There is no setting to disable this functionality.

Q: Is automated issuance still supported?

Yes. Certificates can be automatically issued using workflows triggered by form submissions, course completions, or other criteria.

Q: Will certificates issued prior to this update benefit from the new download format?

Yes. All previously issued certificates now support high-resolution image downloads.
