# **What Are Messaging & Social Channels on Your Google Business Profile (GBP)?**

This feature enables businesses to seamlessly connect popular messaging apps (WhatsApp and Text/SMS) and social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, X, Pinterest) to their Google Business Profile pages. By leveraging HighLevel-integrated numbers and social accounts, businesses can offer familiar outreach options, build higher customer trust, and foster increased engagement.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Add Messaging & Social Channels to Your Google Business Profile (GBP)**

Offering a unified way to manage communication channels, this integration is designed to enhance user experience and streamline your business operations. Benefits include:

- Higher trust and responsiveness by displaying channels your customers already use.

- Increased engagement opportunities leading to more conversations and quality leads.

- Unified communications that keep all messaging in one place with HighLevel-connected channels.

* * *

## **Linking WhatsApp & Text to GBP**

Connecting WhatsApp and Text/SMS channels directly in the GBP flow gives you the flexibility to reach customers using their preferred methods. You are able to pick an existing HighLevel‑integrated number for WhatsApp/Text or Or enter a different number in E.164 format (example for US: +15551234567).

Only one of the messaging channel will be displayed on GBP results though both can be connected. When both WhatsApp and Text (SMS) numbers are added, Google displays Text by default on the public listing; WhatsApp appears only if Text is not provided.

```
Sync & automations require GHL-connected channels: Messages can be synced and automations set up only when the phone number or social profile is connected to HighLevel (CRM) and linked to your GBP. Non-GHL numbers can be shown on GBP but won’t sync or trigger automations.
```

## **Social Channels Integration**

Linking your social profiles on GBP strengthens brand presence and gives customers familiar touch points. If the social account is also connected to HighLevel, DMs for those platforms can be handled in HighLevel; the GBP link itself serves as the public path for visitors.

**Supported Platforms:** Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Pinterest.

All the social channels connected will be displayed on GBP page result under about section.

## **Text/WhatsApp Message Option is Not Visible on GBP Results**

I have added text & WhatsApp channel but these are not visible in GBP results. This may primarily be due to Google's validation for each number being added. Please follow below steps:

1. Go to GBP page setup by either clicking on Update GBP over page selection module in CRM or by going to edit page on google console.

2. Check if edit was approved. Approval is handled by Google team with no influence from our side. In case edit is not approved you can raise a ticket to google directly.
