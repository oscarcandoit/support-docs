# How to change default Brand Boards?

Modified on: Wed, 3 Sep, 2025 at 10:47 AM

Your default brand board is a key part of managing your brand’s visual identity, especially in emails and funnels. It determines which set of colors and fonts will appear in the color and font pickers, ensuring that your branding elements are easily accessible. Here’s a quick guide to understanding and changing your default brand board.

# **What is a Default Brand Board?**

A Brand Board stores your core visual identity (colors, fonts, and logos) so you can apply consistent styling across HighLevel. Marking one board as the Default tells editors and pickers which branding guidelines to show within the editors, speeding up design and reducing mistakes. By default, the first brand board you create is set as the default.

Below is an example of the default brand board colors displayed within the site editor, making it easy to keep your site design in line with your brand guidelines.

## **Key Benefits of Settings a Default Brand Board**

Choosing a default improves day-to-day design speed and standardization.

- **Consistency**: Keeps colors, fonts, and logos aligned across editors

- **Speed**: Surfaces the right swatches and typefaces first in pickers.

- **Simplicity**: Easy to switch between multiple brand guidelines during seasonal promotions.

- **Onboarding**: New team members quickly apply the correct styling.

- **Reusability**: Encourages a single source of truth for brand element.

## **When to Change the Default Brand Board?**

- **Updated Guidelines**: Change the default board when there are significant updates to your brand guidelines, such as new colors, logos, or other key elements. This ensures that all materials and communications align with your latest branding.

- **Specific Occasions**: Change the default board for special occasions or themes, like a red theme for Christmas, if you want to reflect seasonal or event-specific branding. However, it might be more effective to create a separate theme or template for these occasions rather than altering the default board, so you can easily switch between the default and themed boards as needed.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I switch the default again later?**

Yes. Repeat the same steps on another Brand Board and set that one as default. Keep in mind that only one Brand Board can be set as default at any time.

**Q: What if I don’t have any Brand Boards yet?**

Create one first and it will automatically be set as the default Brand Board. To learn how to create a brand board, see: [How to Create a Brand Board](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003136)

**Q: Does changing the default update existing emails and pages automatically?**

No. It updates what appears first in pickers for new or future edits. Existing assets keep their current styling until you manually edit them. Changing the default Brand Board does not make any changes to your assets.
