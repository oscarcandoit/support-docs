**WhatsApp Media Templates Now Available on Mobile Apps**

We’re excited to roll out a powerful new enhancement to our **Mobile Apps**—**WhatsApp Media Template Support**! ?

Sub-account admins and users can now send **media-rich WhatsApp messages** directly from the mobile app using pre-approved templates. This feature is available on **HighLevel, LeadConnector**, and **white-labeled** mobile apps (white-labeled app users must request the update).

* * *

**What’s New**

**Support for the following WhatsApp media templates:**

    •    **Text**

    •    **Images**

    •    **Videos**

    •    **Files**

    •    **Location sharing**

* * *

**How It Works**

    1\.    **Open** your mobile app and select your desired sub-account.

    2\.    Go to the **Conversations** section and start a new WhatsApp conversation or continue an existing one.

    3\.    Choose the appropriate **template type** (Text, Image, Video, File, or Location).

    4\.    Finalize your content and **hit send**—it’s that simple!

* * *

**Why This Matters**

    •    Enables richer and more engaging customer communication while on the go.

    •    Saves time by using approved templates, even when outside the desktop environment.

    •    Helps streamline mobile support, sales, and follow-ups via WhatsApp.

* * *

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q1: Do I need to update my app to access this feature?**

**A:** Yes. Make sure your HighLevel or LeadConnector app is updated to the latest version. For white-labeled apps, you’ll need to request the update via your account representative.

**Q2: What media types are supported in WhatsApp templates?**

**A:** You can now use **text, images, videos, files, and locations** in your media templates directly from the mobile app.

**Q3: Can I create or edit templates in the app?**

**A:** No, template creation and approval must still be done via the web platform. The mobile app allows you to **send** pre-approved templates.

**Q4: Will my previous templates work on the mobile app?**

**A:** Yes, all existing **approved media templates** will be available for use on mobile.

**Q5: Is this feature available for all users in a sub-account?**

**A:** Yes, both **admins and users** with access to the sub-account can send WhatsApp media templates via mobile.
