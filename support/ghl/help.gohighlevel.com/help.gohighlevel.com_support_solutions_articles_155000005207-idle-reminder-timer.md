## **Overview**

We’ve added the Idle Reminder Timer in every agent’s **Advanced Settings**, letting you configure how long (1–20 sec, default 8 sec) the agent waits before issuing a natural re-engagement prompt.

## **What is the Idle Timer Reminder?**

## The Idle Reminder Timer is a configurable delay that determines how long the agent waits during silence before speaking a natural reminder message to re-engage the caller. Helps with:

1. Proactive Engagement: Keeps callers from going silent, reducing dead air.
2. Improved Completion: Steers conversations back on track and boosting success rates.
3. Better UX: Agents sound natural when prompting, enhancing customer experience.

## **What's new?**

1. **Configurable Delay:** Set the idle reminder between 1 and 20 seconds in **Agent Page → Advanced Settings**(default: 8 sec).

2. **Auto‑Hangup:** Calls end automatically if the user remains silent for over 15 seconds after the reminder.


## **How to configure the Idle Reminder Timer?**

1. Navigate toVoice AI click onEdit Agent or Create a new Agent.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046163144/original/tfT8aql9BHPXFQag9iOSSVyEFWQYHzimHg.png?1746519460)

## **Points to note**

1. The delay timer must be between 1 and 20 seconds; default is 8 seconds.

2. Post-reminder silence of more than 15 seconds triggers automatic call termination.
