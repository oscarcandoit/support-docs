# **What are Enhanced Form Interactions with Primary Color Effects?**

The **Primary Color** setting controls how your form elements look when users interact with them. It automatically applies your chosen brand color to input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and other elements — keeping everything visually consistent with your branding.

The Primary Color feature keeps your forms looking professional, cohesive, and on-brand — without needing any design experience. It also improves accessibility by making active and selected elements easier to see.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Primary Color Effects**

- **Brand Consistency:** Creates a cohesive look and feel across Forms, Surveys, and Quizzes.

- **Usability & Clarity:** Highlights hover and active states so users always know where they are typing or what they selected.

- **Trust & Professionalism:** Polished, responsive states can improve perceived quality and completion rates.

- **Fewer Styling Steps:** Set it once and the color applies to multiple interactive elements automatically.

- **Flexibility:** Optionally map the Primary Color to button color for complete visual harmony.

## **Primary Color Accents in Elements**

When you set a **Primary Color**, it updates the appearance of several form interactions. These visual effects help users see where they’re clicking or typing while keeping your forms aligned with your brand colors. The primary color appears only when users interact with a form, such as:

- Hovering over a field

- Clicking or typing in a field

- Selecting a checkbox or radio button

- Choosing a date or option


If no primary color is defined, the form uses the default neutral styling. Below is how the primary color is shown in each type of element.

- **Form Fields:** The border highlights with your primary color when hovered or clicked.

- **Dropdowns:** Options and borders reflect the primary color when opened or selected.

- **Checkboxes & Radio Buttons:** Selected options fill with your primary color.

- **Date Picker:** The active or selected date is highlighted in your primary color.

3. Select a color or enter a custom hex code. Toggle the **“Map Primary color to Button color”** if you want buttons to follow suit. Click **Save** to apply the changes. Your forms will automatically update to use the new color for all interactive elements.
