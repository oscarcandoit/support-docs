If the phone number you need is not listed as available in the HighLevel platform, don’t worry, there are still ways to request the number.

**Step 2: If the country you want is on the list but not on Highlevel, you can buy the number through the private offering form:**

If the country you want is supported by Twilio but not available through HighLevel, you can buy the number directly from the Twilio console. Here’s how:

- If you are using **LC Phone System**, reach out to **[Highlevel support](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/tickets/new)** for assistance before proceeding or filling out this form.

- If you are using **Twilio** and the number isn’t available in the console, you can submit a  [Private Offering Form](https://twlo.my.salesforce-sites.com/PrivateOffering) or [request a ticket with Twilio support](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us).


Learn more about [setting up the bundle/address when requesting a Twilio number](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981437-purchase-twilio-number-please-select-address-to-purchase-number-)

**Private offerings Example:**

Let’s say you need a phone number from **Norway**, but Twilio doesn't have these numbers in stock. They can place an order with their Inventory Team. Here’s what to expect for different types of numbers:

- **Norway Mobile SMS** – $12/month – Expected delivery: 1-2 weeks

- **Norway Toll-Free Voice** – $25/month – Expected delivery: 2-4 weeks

- **Norway Local Voice** – $3/month – Expected delivery: 2-3 weeks


To request a number through a private offering, you will need to provide the following:

1. The **SID** of the account to associate with the number.

2. The **SID** of the bundle to associate with the number.

3. The **SID** of the address to associate with the number.

4. The **required prefix** for the number (if you have a specific one in mind).

5. The **quantity** and **type** of phone numbers you need.


For help finding your **Bundle SID** or **Address SID**, refer to the guides on [How to find a BU SID or an AD SID](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/how-find-bu-sid-or-ad-sid)

If you're requesting numbers with **regulatory compliance**, check out [How to submit a regulatory bundle for Phone Number Regulatory Compliance](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981437-purchase-twilio-number-please-select-address-to-purchase-number-)

Here is also more information on Norway Regulatory Requirements.

Twilio support generally reviews the submission within 3 business days. Once your documents have passed review, let them know so they can place an order for you for the phone number.
