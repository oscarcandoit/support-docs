# **What is Click-to-Call, Click-to-Text, and Click-to-Email?**

Clickable links that initiate a phone call, text message, or email make it easy for users to take immediate action. When configured correctly, clicking these links will open the user’s phone dialer, SMS app, or default email client with pre-filled info. These links are commonly used in Funnels and Websites to improve user experience and boost conversions.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using Click-to Actions**

Click-to links simplify communication by making it easy for leads to reach out with a single tap.

- **One-Tap Communication:** Users can instantly call, text, or email without copying or typing

- **Higher Mobile Engagement:** Mobile users are more likely to interact with clickable actions

- **Time-Saving for Leads:** Auto-fills fields like phone number, message body, or email content

- **Trigger-ready automation:** Can be combined with Trigger Links for follow-up workflows

- **Flexible CTA design:** Click-to links can be added to both text and button elements

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How can I track clicks on these links?**

Use **Trigger Links** to track and automate actions based on clicks.

**Q: What happens if the user's device doesn't support the click-to link?**

If a device doesn’t support the protocol (like `sms:` on desktop), nothing will happen when clicked. It’s recommended to test your links on different devices and consider including fallback contact information.

**Q: Can I add multiple actions in one link (like call and text)?**

No. Each link can only perform one action at a time, either a call, text, or email. To offer multiple options, use separate links or buttons for each action.

**Q: Can I use click-to links inside images or icons?**

Yes. In the Funnel or Website Builder, you can hyperlink images or icons using the same formats. This is useful for visual CTAs like phone or message icons.
