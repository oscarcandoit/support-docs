# Workflow Trigger - Category Completed

Modified on: Wed, 18 Dec, 2024 at 7:11 PM

This article introduces the **"Category Completed"** trigger, a powerful tool for automating workflows based on product or course completion. You’ll learn what this trigger is, its key benefits, how to configure it step by step, and examples of its use across various industries. Finally, we’ll address common questions to help you maximize its potential.

* * *

# **What is Category Completed Trigger**

The Category Completed trigger initiates a workflow when a contact completes a specified category of products or courses. It’s particularly valuable for tracking user progress and automating follow-up actions such as sending completion emails, issuing certificates, or recommending next steps. With optional filters, this trigger ensures workflows are activated only when relevant categories are completed.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Using the Trigger**

- **Automated Follow-Ups:** Streamlines post-completion tasks like sending emails, generating certificates, or assigning new workflows.

- **Personalized Engagement:** Ensures contacts receive tailored recommendations or acknowledgments based on their completion activity.

- **Improved Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for manual monitoring of category completions, saving time and resources.

- **Increased Retention:** Encourages continued engagement by providing relevant next steps after a course or product category is completed.

- **Customizable Filters:** Target specific categories for workflow activation, ensuring precision and relevance.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

Yes, the Category Completed trigger can be combined with other triggers, such as “Task Completed” or “Purchase Made,” to create complex workflows.

**What happens if a contact completes a category multiple times?**

The trigger activates each time the completion criteria are met, ensuring no completion is overlooked.

**Can I target specific products within a category?**
