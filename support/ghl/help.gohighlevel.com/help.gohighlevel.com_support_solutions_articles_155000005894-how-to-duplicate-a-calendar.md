# **Overview of Duplicating Calendars**

Duplicating calendars creates a brand-new calendar that mirrors the configurations of an existing one. Rather than piecing together your availability, reminders and other settings from scratch, you can clone a proven setup with a single action. This ensures consistency in client experiences and saves valuable time when rolling out similar calendars for different staff, locations, or services.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Duplicating a Calendar**

- **Time Savings:** Launch a fully configured calendar in minutes without manual reconfiguring settings

- **Uniform Experience:** Maintain consistent availability slots, meeting types, and communication styles across multiple calendars

- **Error Prevention:** Avoid missing critical details, like buffer times or cancellation policies, that can slip through manual setup

- **Flexible Scaling:** Easily spin up calendars for new team members, additional services, or test environments while preserving your original setup

* * *

## **What Settings Get Duplicated**

The following settings and configurations are automatically copied when you duplicate a calendar:

- **Meeting Details:** Calendar Logo; Calendar Name; Description; Group; Meeting Invite Title; Select Team Member & Assign Meeting Location; Meeting Color

- **Availability:** Weekly Available Hours; Look Busy Settings; Recurring Meeting Options; Slot Interval; Meeting Duration; Minimum Scheduling Notice; Date Range Restrictions; Maximum Bookings Per Day; Maximum Bookings Per Slot; Pre-Buffer Time; Post-Buffer Time

- **Forms & Payments:** Select Form; Widget Order; Pre-Populate Fields (Sticky Contacts); Consent Checkbox; Add Guests; Confirmation Page Settings; Meta Pixel; Auto-Confirm New Calendar Meetings; Payment Settings

- **Notifications & Additional Options:** Email & In-App Notifications; Google/Outlook Invitations; Assign Contacts to Respective Calendar; Skip Contacts if Already Assigned; Allow Rescheduling; Allow Cancellation; Meeting Invite Notes

- **Customizations:** Calendar Cover Image; Widget Style; Primary & Background Colors; Button Text; Calendar Title, Description, and Details; Custom Code


* * *

## **What Settings Do Not Get Duplicated**

Understanding which elements are excluded from duplication helps you configure the new calendar correctly:

- **Calendar Name:** The cloned calendar is automatically named **Copy of '\[Original Name\]'**. Update the name during setup to avoid confusion

- **Calendar ID:** A new, unique Calendar ID is generated for the duplicate

- **Calendar URL:** The duplicate’s URL is based on the original click link, with additional random numbers appended at the end

- **Workflow Automations:** Any triggers or workflows tied to the original calendar are not cloned and must be recreated or reassigned

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I duplicate any calendar type (Round-Robin, Class, Event)?**

All calendar types support duplication and inherit their unique configurations.

**Q: Are workflows or automations duplicated too?**

A: No, workflows must be recreated or reassigned to the new calendar manually.

**Q: Will existing booking links redirect to the new calendar?**

No. The booking link from the original calendar remains tied to that calendar and continues pointing to it. The duplicate generates its own unique booking link.

**Q: Will the calendar’s time zone settings carry over?**

Yes, the duplicate calendar retains the same time zone configuration as the original, ensuring bookings display at the correct local time.
