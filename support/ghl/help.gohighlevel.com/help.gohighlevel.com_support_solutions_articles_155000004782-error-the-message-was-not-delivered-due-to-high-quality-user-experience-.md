## **Understanding the Issue**

This error occurs due to **Meta’s restrictions on marketing messages**, designed to maintain a **high-quality user experience** and prevent excessive promotional messaging.

## **Why Does This Happen?**

If a customer receives Certain **marketing templates** within a **single day**, Meta may temporarily block **additional marketing messages** to that user. However, **utility templates** are not affected by this restriction and can still be delivered.

## **How to Resolve the Issue**

### **Option 1: Use a Utility Template**

- **Utility templates** (such as order confirmations, payment reminders, and account updates) are not subject to this restriction.
- Sending a **utility template** should allow your message to be delivered without issues.

### **Option 2: Retry Sending the Marketing Template Later**

- Meta’s block on marketing messages is usually **temporary**.
- After some time, try resending the **marketing template**, and it may be successfully delivered.
