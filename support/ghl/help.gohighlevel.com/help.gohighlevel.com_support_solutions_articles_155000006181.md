# Business Profile Settings - General Information

Modified on: Fri, 29 Aug, 2025 at 4:09 PM

General Information covers your brand identity and key account properties. Set your logo, business names, contact email/phone, branded system-generated links (API domain), business website, niche, and API key so downstream features use accurate, on-brand data.

To learn more about the Business Profile Settings, including how to navigate to the settings panel, see: [Business Profile Settings Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006223-business-profile-settings#Where-Do-I-Find-the-Business-Profile?)

# **General Information Settings**

These fields act as the single source of truth for brand assets and company identifiers used across HighLevel. Complete each entry carefully, matching official records where noted. After updating, save your changes and spot‑check a few assets (e.g., a calendar link, an email template) to confirm the new values appear as expected.

#### **Location ID**

When you interact with our support teams, they may request that you provide a location ID where you face a problem. Location ID is a unique ID given to every sub-account in your agency account. This helps us identify your client's account and narrow down our troubleshooting efforts.

#### **Business Logo**

Upload the business logo you want to be associated with this sub-account. The logo will represent this specific sub-account when looking at the "Accounts" list in your Agency Dashboard view, and can be used across many features of HighLevel, including invoices and emails, and even as a Custom Field in messaging.

**Example:** _{{location.logo\_url}}_

#### **Friendly Business Name**

This is the name that will be used for your sub-account (location) when using the Custom Field "Account -> Name" in messaging, workflows, and other areas across the app.

**Example:** _{{location.name}}_

#### **Legal Business Name**

The legal business name is the name that will be used in any future compliance registration. What you add here should perfectly match the business name as it is displayed on legal business documentation, such as your business license and registration paperwork.

#### **Business Email**

Enter the email you want to be used for this account when adding the Custom Field "Account -> Email" to messages, emails, workflows, or other areas in the app that allow for Custom Fields.

**Example:** _{{location.email}}_

#### **Business Phone**

Enter the phone number you want to be used for this account when adding the Custom Field "Account -> Phone" to messages, emails, workflows, or other areas in the app that allow for Custom Fields.

**Example**: _{{location.phone}}_

```
If you want this number to match the number that is used for calling and messaging, you would first need to configure your LC phone number, and then copy/paste your purchased number in the "Business Phone" field.
```

#### **Branded Domain**

Each sub-account (location) can create a "branded domain" by connecting to a sub-domain in their hosting provider. This branded domain will be used as the URL address for things like "Trigger Links", "Calendars", "Forms", "Surveys", and more.

Below are a few different help articles that will explain the Branded Domain in more detail and how to configure it for your sub-account:

- [Domains In HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002561#API-or-Branded-Domain)

- [How to Configure Branded System-Generated Links (API Domain)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001143244)

#### **Business Website**

Enter the website URL you want to be used for this account when adding the Custom Field "Account -> Website" to messages, emails, workflows, or other areas in the app that allow for Custom Fields.

**Example:** _{{location.website}}_

#### **Business Niche**

Assign a business niche to your sub-account by choosing from the list in the dropdown. If you target multiple niches, choose the niche that best describes your target market.

#### **Business Currency**

Choose a default currency for your sub-account. This currency selection will apply automatically across all payment-related pages and flows. If no currency is selected, it will default to the country of the business' physical address. This setting is useful for business doing business in a different country than they are located in.

#### **API Key**

API keys are used to connect 2 or more software applications together with the intention of sharing information and/or performing and action that requires the approval and validation of the software applications involved.

For example, when you create a Zap in Zapier, you are just connecting to the API of different software applications. Zapier just makes this a clean and "pretty" experience for the end user, but underneath all the cool looking software that Zapier provides is just a bunch of API keys connecting to each other depending on how you configure your Zaps.

Your sub-account (or location) API Key can be used when connecting to Zapier and other applications that may require an API key to send or receive information to or from any specific sub-account (location).

#### **Update Information Button**

When you're all finished updating your General Information, make sure to save!
