## **What is the Email Template Import Feature?**

The Email Template Import feature allows you to seamlessly migrate your existing email templates—regardless of their origin—into your HighLevel account. By sending a test or campaign email to a dynamic email address provided by HighLevel, your template will automatically appear in your **Code Editor**, where you can modify and reuse it as needed.

This tool helps save time and preserve your original designs, so you don’t have to start from scratch or recreate your email formatting manually.

## **Key Benefits of Importing Templates from Any Platform**

This feature is designed to simplify migration and improve template management for users coming from other email platforms.

- ✅ **Simplified onboarding** – Quickly bring templates into HighLevel

- ? **Template preservation** – Maintains your original design, layout, and code

- ? **Easy reuse** – Skip rebuilding and start editing right away

- ? **Flexible editing** – Fully customizable within the **Code Editor**

- ? **Platform-agnostic** – Compatible with any platform that supports test or campaign emails

- ⚡️ **Fast and automatic** – Templates appear within seconds after sending


## **How to Import Email Templates Using the Code Editor**

Follow these steps to import your existing templates directly into HighLevel’s Code Editor:

1. Navigate to **Email Marketing > Templates**

2. Click **New**, then select **Import**

3. In the import menu, choose **Other Platform** from the list

4. Copy the **system-generated email address** displayed on the screen

5. From your original platform (e.g., Mailchimp, Klaviyo), send your template as a **test email** or **campaign email** to the copied address

6. Return to HighLevel. Your email will be imported and listed in the **Templates** area

7. Click on the imported template to open it in the **Code Editor**


You can now edit, clone, or assign the imported template to an email campaign.

## **Code Editor**

The Code Editor gives you full control over the structure, styling, and dynamic content of your emails. Imported templates appear directly in this editor, giving you the flexibility to:

- Customize HTML and inline CSS

- Add personalization variables

- Preview changes in real time

- Save templates for reuse

- Apply the design in campaigns and automation


If you’re comfortable with code or working with a developer, the Code Editor is your best tool for precision customization.
