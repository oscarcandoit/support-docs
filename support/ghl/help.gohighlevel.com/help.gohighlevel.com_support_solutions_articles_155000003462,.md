# **What is the Pause, Resume, or Cancel Feature?**

This functionality allows you to take control of scheduled email campaigns before they are sent. Whether you need to make quick edits, delay an email blast, or stop a campaign completely, you can now manage it effortlessly from the campaign actions menu.

The Pause, Resume, and Cancel controls help maintain flexibility and precision in email marketing. Pausing lets you temporarily halt a campaign to review or adjust content. Resuming restores its schedule, while Cancel ensures emails won’t send at all. This prevents mistakes and helps marketers stay agile.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of This Feature**

Understanding these benefits allows you to use campaign controls strategically—keeping email sends accurate, timely, and relevant.

- **Flexibility:** Temporarily pause campaigns to make quick adjustments.

- **Control:** Cancel emails that are no longer needed before they go out.

- **Accuracy:** Ensure only reviewed and approved content reaches your audience.

- **Time Efficiency:** Instantly resume paused campaigns without rebuilding them.

- **Error Prevention:** Avoid sending incorrect or outdated information to contacts.

## **When to Use Each Option**

Understanding when to use Pause, Resume, or Cancel helps ensure you manage campaigns proactively, maintaining both accuracy and timing.

- **Pause:** When you need more time to review or make last-minute edits before launch.

- **Resume:** When your paused campaign is ready to continue sending.

- **Cancel:** When the campaign is no longer relevant or contains unrecoverable errors.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I resume a campaign after the original scheduled time?**

Yes. If resumed after the original send time, the campaign will send immediately.

**Q: What happens to paused campaigns if I don’t resume them?**

They will remain paused indefinitely until you manually resume or cancel them.

**Q: Does canceling a campaign delete it?**

No. Canceling only prevents it from sending. You can still clone or edit it later.

**Q: Can I pause A/B test campaigns?**

Yes. Pause, Resume, and Cancel options work for all scheduled campaign types, including A/B tests.

**Q: Will pausing affect analytics or performance tracking?**

No. Analytics are tracked from the moment the campaign is sent, so pausing beforehand has no effect.
