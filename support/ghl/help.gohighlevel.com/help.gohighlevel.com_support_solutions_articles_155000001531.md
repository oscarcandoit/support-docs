- **Custom Widgets & Metrics:** Add, edit, and update metrics with unlimited flexibility to surface the insights that matter most.

- **Scheduled Reports:** Schedule reports at any frequency you choose and deliver them automatically to your team.

- **Full Customization:** Personalize your dashboards with themes, colors, and backgrounds to match your brand.

- **Deeper Insights:** View and analyze data in multiple formats, including tables and other visualizations.

#### **Step 3:** Enter a Dashboard Name

Type a name into the **Dashboard Name** field.

``

#### **Step 4:** Set Dashboard Permissions

Use the **Private Dashboard** toggle to control visibility. Turn it **ON** to make it private, or **OFF** to allow team access.

If Private Dashboard is turned OFF, set **access levels** for Agency User, Account Admin, and Account User.

```
Note: If this toggle is missing, ensure you're still on the "New Dashboard" page.

#### **Step 6:** Choose How to Add Widgets

After the dashboard is created, you'll arrive at the **Quick Start Widgets** page. This is the default you always see when a dashboard is blank (no widgets). From here, choose one of the following options:

Click **"Confirm & Add"** to quickly insert top-used widgets.

Continue to Step 9.
