## **What is Google Calendar Re-Integration?**

If your **Google** **Calendar events are not syncing**, or a user has recently **updated their Google account permissions**, you may need to re-integrate Google Calendar with HighLevel.

Reintegration is recommended when:

- Calendar events **stop syncing**.

- Google account **permissions were changed** or revoked.

- A **calendar was** **disconnected** and needs to be reconnected.

- Open **Authorization errors** or **sync issues** are appearing in the account.

* * *

## **Steps to Re-Integrate a Google Calendar**

### **Step 1:** Delete the Google Calendar

You can delete a connected Google Calendar from two sections.

**1\. From the My Profile section:**

Click on **Settings** from your sub-account. Select the **My Profile** Option and navigate to Calendar Settings and click on the **Bin/Delete** icon of the connected Google Account.

**2\. From Calendar Connections Section:**

Navigate to **Settings** and Calendars and select the **Connections** tab. Under **Connected Calendars**, click on the **Bin/Delete** icon of the connected Google Account.

### **Step 2:** Re-Integrate Google Calendar

Similarly, you can reconnect the Google Calendar from the same two sections as specified above, the My Profile Section and the Calendar Connections Section.

1\. Click on your sub-account **Settings** and select the **My Profile** option, and under **Calendar Settings**, click on the **\+ Add New** button. You can also follow our [**How to Integrate Google Calendar with HighLevel**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002369) guide to successfully connect your Google account.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I need to remove the old integration before reconnecting?**

**Q: Can I connect multiple calendars to the same user?**

Yes, you can add multiple calendars but one you can have only one primary calendar.
