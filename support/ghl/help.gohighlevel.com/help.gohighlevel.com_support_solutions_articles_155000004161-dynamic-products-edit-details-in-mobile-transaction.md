# Dynamic Products - Edit Details In Mobile Transaction

Modified on: Tue, 12 Nov, 2024 at 1:00 PM

**While performing a transaction, you are not restricted to use the existing details that were already configured for the product(s). Feel free to modify every single thing - Name, Description, Taxes, Price, and Quantity. You can even save your changes to the catalogue for reuse later.**

- Custom Item Editor
\- While adding a custom amount using the POS/Invoice/Estimate using the Keypad, you can change the name from Custom Item to anything you want! This feature is accessible by tapping on the highlighted Item Details button visible right below the amount under the Keypad tab. You can even add a description for that custom item in case you want to include it in the final invoice or receipt.
- Taxes for Custom Items
\- You can link taxes to custom items added using the keypad. This feature is accessible by tapping on the highlighted Item Details button below the amount under the Keypad tab.
- Save for Later Use
\- You can save a custom item to your catalog if you would like to use it again in the future. This is accessible by tapping on the highlighted Item Details button below the amount under the Keypad tab and toggling on Save for later use.
- Edit items on review
\- All the above mentioned features are available in two different areas - On the keypad page and on the review page. You can also edit the details of Catalog items on the review page by tapping on the item tile and editing all the necessary details.
