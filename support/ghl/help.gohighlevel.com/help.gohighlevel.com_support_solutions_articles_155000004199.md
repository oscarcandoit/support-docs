| The first time you use the SaaS Configurator you will see this screen. There are two payment structures to choose from.<br>Stripe - Stripe has always had native support in HighLevel so this one is simple.<br>Other - If you want to use a payment provider other than Stripe, or you want to mix and match payment providers, then this one has the flexibility you need. | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036601136/original/cZ1fsNmpxOvNehhxe7H5yKk4UCQlJDrQUQ.png?1731642926) |
| SaaS Mode is a combination of the Agency SaaS Configurator and one or more Agency Subaccounts with SaaS Products in them.<br>In brief:<br>- Create a Subaccount for your Agency<br>- Create a SaaS Product via Agency Account > SaaS Configurator > Plans & Pricing > Add Your Plan OR go to Agency Subaccount > Payments > Products > New Product directly (they go to the same place)<br>- Toggle "use as SaaS Product"<br>- Build and save the SaaS Plan<br>- The Subaccount and the SaaS Plan will show up in the SaaS Configurator<br>See this article for the full details: [Guide to SaaS Plan Creation, Sales, and Customer Onboarding](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003670) | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036656123/original/rGLwBAFvuVcS9npEiz0p0p-LNFJL1RkMoA.png?1731693603) |
| You can have many Agency Subaccounts and many SaaS Plans in each of them. They will all be gathered together in the Agency SaaS Configurator. | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036654931/original/VPTIc3USYS6qrI3HudDkw8gddyHFguwjrA.png?1731691564) |
| You can use many Payment Providers because those integrations are controlled in each Subaccount. | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036656356/original/AP9tNtaQyu_1qL9RLVPNgngiHMMJyLF3xw.png?1731694270) |
