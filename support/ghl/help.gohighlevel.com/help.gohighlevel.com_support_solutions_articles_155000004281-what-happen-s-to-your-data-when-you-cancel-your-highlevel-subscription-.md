# What happen​s to your data when you cancel your HighLevel Subscription?

Modified on: Thu, 29 May, 2025 at 12:01 PM

Canceling your HighLevel subscription will impact all your sub-accounts, including a loss of access to critical data and features. Here's what happens post-cancellation:

# **Loss of Access**

After cancellation, all your sub-accounts will lose access to the following:

1. **Contacts:** All saved contact data will no longer be accessible.

2. **Conversations:** Ongoing and past conversations will no longer be accessible.

3. **Calendars:** Any Scheduled Events and Appointments will no longer be accessible.

4. **Automations:** Any workflows and automations will stop functioning.

5. **Funnels:** All funnels and related data will no longer be accesible.

6. **Phone Numbers and A2P:** Your Phone numbers and A2P will be deleted 14 days after cancellation. During this time, you will still be charged for the same. After 14 days , these numbers will be permanently deleted.

When you cancel your HighLevel subscription, your agency data is retained for **90 days**. This allows you to reactivate your account and recover your data if you decide to return. After 90 days, your data is **automatically and permanently deleted** on the 91st day. If you prefer to have your data deleted sooner, you can submit a request using the [Data Deletion Request Form](https://www.gohighlevel.com/privacy-and-security)

```
Ensure you export any essential data before canceling your subscription. For more information, please contact our support team 24/7 via the blue question mark icon on the top right corner of the screen when logged in.
