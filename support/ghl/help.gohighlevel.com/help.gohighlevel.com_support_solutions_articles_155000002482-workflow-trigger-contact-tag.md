### **What is the Contact Tag Workflow Trigger?**

The Contact Tag Workflow Trigger allows you to automate workflows in HighLevel whenever a contact tag is added or removed. Tags are labels you assign to contacts to help you organize, categorize, and take action based on their attributes or behavior.

For example, adding a "New Customer" tag can trigger an automated welcome email, while removing a "Lead" tag can update sales team notifications.

* * *

### **Key Benefits of Using Contact Tag Triggers**

1. **Automation:** Streamlines your workflow by automating actions based on tags.
2. **Organization:** Helps maintain a clean, actionable database of contacts.
3. **Targeted Engagement:** Allows you to segment customers and deliver personalized messaging.
4. **Scalability:** Works seamlessly across campaigns, pipelines, and multiple teams.
