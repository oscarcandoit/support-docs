## **Overview**

The new Assets Protected Snapshots feature allows you to share snapshots with enhanced protection for your intellectual property (IP). This feature ensures that your valuable assets cannot be easily re-shared or duplicated by others.

## **Why Use Assets Protected Snapshots?**

Many customers invest significant time and effort into creating complex assets such as workflows and funnels in their sub-accounts. These assets are often sold offline through snapshots. However, there have been instances where customers re-sell these assets by creating new snapshots from sub-accounts, which undermines the value of the original creator's work. Assets Protected Snapshots address this issue by preventing unauthorized duplication and re-sharing of your assets.

## **How to created Assets Protected Snapshots**

### Step 1 : New Snapshot Share Modal

**Enable Assets Protection:** A new option in the Snapshot Share Modal allows you to enable Assets protection when generating a new share link. This ensures that the assets in your snapshot cannot be re-shared or duplicated.

### Step 2 : Share the link with Assets Protection Enabled

## **Trying to snapshot a sub account  created with Assets Protected assets**

**Asset List:** The modal displays a list of all assets that will be included in the snapshot.

**Restricted Assets:** It also highlights any assets that are Assets protected within the sub-account and will not be included in the snapshot.
