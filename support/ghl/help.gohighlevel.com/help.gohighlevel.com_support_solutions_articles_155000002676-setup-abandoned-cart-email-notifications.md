# Setup abandoned cart Email notifications

Modified on: Thu, 27 Jun, 2024 at 6:15 AM

To setup an email for abandoned cart notifications, store owners can configure it as follows:

### **Step 1: Create a New Email Template**

This can be accessed in: _Marketing > Emails > Email Templates > "New" CTA._ You can create from a Blank template or from a existing Template.

### **Step 2: Add Shopping Cart element to your email template**

In the Add element section, drag and drop shopping cart element to the email template. This will populate the abandoned cart items in this section.

### **Step 3: Add text to your Email**

Custom values can also be added to the Email template where data will auto-populate. Post adding the details, save the email template.

### **Step 4: Choose the email saved template and apply**

The last step is choosing the email template for sending the notifications. This can be implemented via: _Payments > Notifications > Email Template > Choose the template._ Also, setup the time duration after which the buyers receive the notifications.
