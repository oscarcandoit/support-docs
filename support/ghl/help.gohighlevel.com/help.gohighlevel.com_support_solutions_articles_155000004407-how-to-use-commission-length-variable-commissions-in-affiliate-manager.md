## **Overview**

The new Commission Length and Variable Commissions Over Time features allow you to customize how and for how long affiliates are rewarded for recurring product sales.

1. **Commission Length:** Pay affiliates for a limited number of transactions instead of indefinitely.
2. **Variable Commissions:** Offer different commission rates for specific charge counts.

### **Step 1: Create or Edit an Affiliate Campaign**

- If you're new to affiliate campaigns, [click here for a guide on creating campaigns.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003641)


### **Step 2: Set the Default Commission**

- In Step 2 of the campaign setup, add the default commission value that affiliates will earn by default.


### **Step 3: Enable Commission Length**

- Click Commission Length.

- By default, commissions are given until the customer cancels.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155038550542/original/coBmKW38xPbyR3OYFUahlZjEm6Bd0GcabA.png?1734524683)

- Choose "By Count" to set a limit on the number of charges.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155038550567/original/n42CUg0zPRRto8uFVNh791gAB_Gmme9Hxg.png?1734524698)

- **Example:** If the limit is set to 3, the affiliate will earn a commission only for the first 3 charges.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155038550601/original/kIdwb6ZK6zIDkqGxZQssvfpwlJcisBurdA.png?1734524719)

- **Note:** The limit applies to charges, not time intervals. Whether the subscription is monthly or yearly, commissions are based on the number of successful charges.


### **Step 4: Set Variable Commissions Over Time**

- Toggle Variable Commissions to enable this feature.

- Select Two Levels to define different rates for specific charge counts![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155038550631/original/jXSHTfCxN8EIEZ5udCJNAcZ9r4iOvw14UQ.png?1734524783)

- **Example:** "For the first **3** _\[You can configure this number\]_ charges, the commission is **33%** _\[You can configure this number\]_; and **23%** _\[This is the default commission\]_ after.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155038550677/original/tjAOqL0hHnt7WHIfKeJU4OAOfNzT00he_A.png?1734524807)

- If needed, configure additional tiers for more granular control.


### **Step 5: Publish Your Campaign**

- Save the campaign, and your updated commission settings will be applied.

```
Please Note:
Commission Priority Order
1. Product-Based Commissions
2. Variable Commissions
3. Default Commissions

This ensures that specific commission settings take precedence over general ones.
