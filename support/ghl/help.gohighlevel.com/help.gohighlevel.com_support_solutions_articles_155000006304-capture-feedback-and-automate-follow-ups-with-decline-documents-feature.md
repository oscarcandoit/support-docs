# **What is Decline Documents Feature?**

The **Decline Documents** feature in HighLevel applies to files created and shared through the **Documents & Contracts** tool, such as proposals, agreements, and contracts. Instead of leaving a document unsigned, recipients can formally decline it by selecting a predefined reason or adding custom notes. Business users can also mark a document as declined to keep records accurate. Once this action is taken, the document status changes to **Declined**, ensuring clear communication and structured feedback.

After a decline action, the document automatically moves to the **Archived** section, where it can no longer be signed but remains stored with full historical details. Users can review who declined the document, when it happened, and why, giving teams actionable insights. This not only improves accountability but also enables workflow automation and better follow-up strategies.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Decline Documents**

Decline Documents makes it easier to handle situations where a client does not accept a proposal, agreement, or contract. By capturing clear feedback and updating the document status to **Declined**, this feature removes uncertainty and creates opportunities for automation and follow-up.

- **Clear client feedback**: Collect predefined reasons or custom notes when a document is declined.

- **Workflow automation**: Trigger actions like notifications, follow-ups, or new tasks when status = Declined.

- **Accurate document tracking**: Automatically archive declined items and view complete decline history.

- **Personalized communication**: Use decline reasons and notes as custom values in emails.

- **Operational efficiency**: Save time by eliminating guesswork and keeping your document pipeline organized.

* * *

## **Recipient Flow**

Recipients have a simple and intuitive way to decline a document. From the document view, they can select the **Decline Document** option in the top-right menu, choose a predefined reason, or enter custom notes. This ensures you receive accurate and actionable feedback directly from clients.

### **Decline as a Recipient**

Recipients open the document link. Click **Decline Document** from the top-right menu.

### **Select Reason**

Select a predefined reason or add a custom note. Submit the decline action.

## **Business User Flow**

Business users can mark documents as declined after sending them, ensuring the system reflects the correct status. This option is helpful when a recipient communicates outside the platform (for example, by phone or email) that they are not proceeding. Recording the outcome ensures accurate tracking and consistency across records.

### **Go to Documents & Contracts**

Navigate to **Documents & Contracts** in HighLevel. Locate the document under **Waiting for others**.

### **Select Document**

Click the three-dot menu. Select **Mark as Declined**.

### **Specify a Reason**

## **Automations (Workflows)**

Automations help ensure declined documents trigger the right actions at the right time. By adding a workflow trigger for the **Declined** status, you can automatically send notifications, assign tasks, or create follow-up campaigns.

In HighLevel, you can use **Workflows** to automate actions whenever a document is marked as **Declined**. Follow the steps to set this up:

Go to your workflows and create a new trigger using **Documents & Contracts → Status → Declined**. From there, you can define what happens next, such as sending a notification to your team, creating a follow-up task, or starting a nurture sequence to re-engage the client.

* * *

## **Email Templates**

In the Email Builder, open or create a new template and click the **Custom Values** dropdown. From here, navigate to **Documents & Contracts** and select either **Document Decline Reasons** to display the specific reason chosen, or **Document Decline Reason Body** to include any detailed notes provided.

Using these values ensures your messages give clients clear context and feel more tailored to their situation.

- **Document Decline Reasons**: Inserts the specific reason chosen.

- **Document Decline Reasons Body**: Inserts the detailed notes provided.

## **Tracking Declined Documents**

Declined documents are automatically moved to the **Archived** section, where they can no longer be signed. A detailed decline history is available, showing who declined, when it happened, and the reason or notes provided. This complete visibility supports data-driven decisions and effective follow-up strategies.
