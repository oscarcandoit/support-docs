# **What is the Voice AI Outbound Calling Dashboard?**

The Outbound Calling Dashboard is a new analytics view inside HighLevel’s Voice AI suite. It aggregates data for every call your AI agents place—connected, voicemail, no-answer, or failed—and presents easy-to-read tiles, charts, and logs. Modeled after the inbound dashboard, it delivers a holistic picture of outbound engagement and automation performance, all in one place.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Outbound Calling Dashboard**

- Instant performance snapshot—see attempts, connections, and actions at a glance.

- Identify drop-off points—spot high no-answer or voicemail rates and adjust local-presence dialing or timing.

- Measure call quality—track total and average talk time to ensure conversations hit your benchmarks.

- Coach with context—use sentiment charts to uncover friction points in real conversations.

- Workflow accountability—new “Workflow Name” column ties every call back to its originating automation.

- Unified reporting—aligns outbound and inbound metrics for apples-to-apples comparisons.

* * *

## **Attempted Calls**

Captures every outbound dial—including connected, voicemail, no-answer, and failed attempts—so you always know how many prospects your AI tried to reach. Use this tile to:

- Monitor overall dialing volume day-to-day.

- Gauge list coverage and pacing for time-boxed campaigns.

- Spot sudden spikes in failed calls that may indicate number blocking or carrier issues.

* * *

## **Connected Calls**

This section focuses on successful connections:

- Total Connected Calls—how many outbound interactions reached a live person or voicemail box.

- Total & Average Duration—understand talk-time efficiency and adherence to compliance limits.

- Trend Charts—toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly views to uncover seasonality or campaign impacts.

* * *

## **Actions and Sentiment**

Beyond raw call counts, HighLevel records every automation trigger (e.g., task creation, tag applied) and detects customer sentiment in real time:

- Actions Triggered—validate that your workflows fire correctly when specific phrases are spoken.

- Sentiment Analysis—visualize positive, neutral, and negative call outcomes to refine scripts and objection handling.

* * *

## **Detailed Call Logs**

The log view lists every outbound attempt with sortable columns such as:

- Call Status—Connected, Voicemail, No Answer, or Failed.

- Workflow Name—pinpoints the exact Workflow or Campaign that initiated the call.

- Date/Time, Duration, Recording, Transcript—click to review conversations in context.

- A new Call Type filter—borrowed from the inbound logs—lets you isolate Test vs. Live calls for cleaner analytics.

* * *

## **How to Set Up and Use the Outbound Calling Dashboard**

Use these steps to access and configure the dashboard for the first time:

- Log in to the desired sub-account, then navigate to AI Agents > Voice AI > Dashboards & Logs > Outbound.

- Adjust your Time Range filter (Today, 7 Days, 30 Days, Custom) to scope the data set.

- Hover over any chart for exact counts, or click a tile to jump directly to the filtered Call Logs.

- Export data via the ⋮ kebab-menu for CSV reporting or share a read-only link with stakeholders.

- Repeat regularly.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Where can I find the Outbound dashboard if I only see Inbound?**

A: Ensure your sub-account has Voice AI enabled and at least one AI agent set to “Outbound.” The Outbound tab appears once the first outbound call is logged.

**Q: Do Test Calls affect my outbound metrics?**

A: No. Test calls are excluded from analytics just like on the inbound dashboard, though they still appear in Call Logs when “Test Calls” is selected.

**Q: Why are some calls marked “Failed”?**

A: Failed indicates the carrier rejected the call or the number was unreachable. High failure rates often trace back to caller-ID spam flags or invalid numbers.

**Q: Can I listen to recordings from voicemail calls?**

A: Yes. Every Connected or Voicemail status includes a playable recording and full transcript in the Call Logs drawer.

**Q: How is sentiment scored on voicemail?**

A: Sentiment is only calculated when the AI connects to a live caller; voicemail recordings are excluded from sentiment charts.

**Q: Is Local Presence Dialing reflected in these metrics?**

A: Absolutely—each attempt shows the specific caller ID used, so you can compare answer rates across local numbers.

**Q: Can I export only Connected calls?**

A: Yes. Apply the Call Status filter = Connected, then choose Export → CSV.

**Q: How often does the dashboard refresh?**

A: Data updates in near real time—typically within 60 seconds of the call ending.
