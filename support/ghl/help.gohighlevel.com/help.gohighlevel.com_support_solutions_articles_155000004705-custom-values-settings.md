## **What Are Custom Values?**

The Custom Value function is a Key and a Value that can be accessed anywhere in the platform. Instead of writing the same value over and over again in many places, you can write the Key everywhere. Then, if you change the one Value in the Custom Values list, the Key will be updated everywhere automatically.

## **How To Manage Custom Values**

There are several management actions you can do with Custom Values once they are created.

### **Folders**

Click on the Folders tab and then the Add New Custom Value Folder button. Folders with Custom Values in them will appear in the All Values list > Folder column. All folders will be listed in the Folders list.
