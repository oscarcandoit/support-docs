## **Managing Scheduled Reports for Sub-Accounts**

In the Agency View, you can manage all scheduled reports across sub-accounts from a centralized interface. This includes pausing, resuming, filtering, and configuring behavior for newly added accounts.

### **Scheduled Reports Table**

Navigate to: **Agency View → Sub-Accounts → View Scheduled Reports**

- View a list of all scheduled reports for sub-accounts![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049079548/original/mUtZIGCYBWMbLYXYiSNLxh1opUv-CXLCuQ.png?1751283692)

- Use checkboxes to select one or more reports

- Apply bulk actions to **pause** or **resume** selected reports![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049079568/original/8lC4urkJJXVvpEA4-OlByVM0OZfz8FH6Jw.png?1751283703)

- Use filters to display reports by status (Active or Paused)


### **Settings Panel**

Click the **Settings** (⚙️) icon on the top right of the Scheduled Reports page to access configuration options:

- **Pause All Reports**: Instantly pauses all scheduled reports across sub-accounts

- **Auto-Create Reports Toggle**:

  - When **enabled**, a new report is automatically generated and activated whenever a new sub-account is added

  - When **disabled**, reports for new sub-accounts will not be auto-created—allowing for manual control

These settings help streamline bulk report management and provide more flexibility over how new sub-account reports are handled.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049079632/original/-CUNYvrCrynF7vvFogZBaoCnReqleeuSuA.png?1751283738)

### **How to Use**
