## **What is a Subaccount/Location in HighLevel?**

A sub-account (location) in HighLevel is an independent business or client account that operates within an agency. It allows businesses to manage their marketing, automation, and customer relationships separately from other accounts. Each sub-account has its own CRM, workflows, campaigns, integrations and other key features.

* * *

## **Why Would You Need to Delete a Subaccount?**

- **Client No Longer Uses the Platform:** If a client decides to discontinue using HighLevel, deleting the sub-account may be necessary.

- **Duplicate or Unused Accounts:** Sometimes, businesses create multiple sub-accounts by mistake. Deleting the extra ones helps keep the system organized.

- **Cost Management:** Reducing the number of active sub-accounts can help manage billing costs.

- **Security and Compliance:** If an account is no longer needed, deleting it ensures that sensitive customer data is removed from the system.


* * *

## **Key Considerations Before Deleting a Subaccount**

Deleting a sub-account should be done with caution since the action is permanent after 24 hours.

A sub-account (location) in HighLevel represents a business or client account within your agency. Deleting a sub-account is a permanent action after 24 hours, so it should only be done when absolutely necessary.

Before deleting a sub-account, keep the following in mind:

- **Permanent Data Loss:** After 24 hours, all contacts, messages, campaigns, and settings will be lost.

- **Integration Disconnection:** Ensure that **Twilio, Mailgun, Facebook, Google, and other third-party integrations** are disconnected.

- **Pausing Instead of Deleting:** If you're unsure, you can **pause** the sub-account instead of permanently deleting a subaccount.

## **How to Delete a Subaccount**

Deleting a sub-account in HighLevel is a straightforward process, but it's important to proceed with caution. Once a sub-account is scheduled for deletion, you have a 24-hour window to undo the action before it becomes permanent. Follow these steps to ensure you delete the sub-account correctly.

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Subccounts in the Agency View

Click on **Subaccounts** in the left-side menu of the Agency View and select **Subaccount** from the list which you wish to delete.

### **Step 2:** Access the Manage Client Option

Click on the three-dot menu next to the sub-account and click on **Manage Client**.

### **Step 3:** Initiate Deletion

Click on **Actions** on the top-right corner of the Subaccounts section and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.

### **Step 4:** Confirm the Deletion Process

Before finalizing the deletion, you will be presented with several disclaimers that highlight the consequences of this action. Please read and acknowledge them carefully before proceeding.

```
IMPORTANT: There are several disclaimers before deleting a sub-account.

1. I confirm that I have discussed this with my client and have the authority to take this action.

2. I understand that this action is irreversible & all data inside this sub-account will be lost.

3. I confirm to disconnect and close the LC Phone account for this location. I am aware that this would mean all the numbers and A2P Campaigns will be deleted and cannot be retrieved back.
```

### **Step 5:** The24-Hour Reversal Period

After scheduling deletion, you have **24 hours** to undo the process. A notification appears on the **Sub-Accounts page** with a **"Click here to undo"** link.

```
Final Deletion: If no action is taken within 24 hours, the sub-account is permanently deleted.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Can I recover a deleted subaccount after 24 hours?**

No, once the 24-hour grace period passes, the deletion is permanent and irreversible.

**Q. Can I pause a subaccount instead of deleting it?**

Yes, you can **pause** a sub-account through the Actions menu if you may need it later.

**Q. Will I be charged for a paused subaccount?**

No, pausing an account does not incur charges.

**Q. What happens to connected integrations when I delete a subaccount?**

All integrations (Twilio, Mailgun, Facebook, Google, etc.) must be manually disconnected. If left connected, they will stop working immediately.
