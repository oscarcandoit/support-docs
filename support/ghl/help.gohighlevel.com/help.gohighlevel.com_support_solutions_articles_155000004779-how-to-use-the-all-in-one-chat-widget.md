## Overview

The All-in-One Chat widget allows you to offer multiple communication channels (Live Chat, Email, and WhatsApp) in one unified interface. This not only saves you from managing multiple widgets but also provides your visitors with a seamless experience when choosing how they want to reach out.

## Using the All-in-One Chat Widget

1. **Switching Channels:**

Visitors can easily switch between Live, Email, or WhatsApp Chat using the Back button in the chat header. **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043227189/original/w4-Fxq1VzilY28YKSwezVKIP2Y3vQzyC4Q.png?1741875628)**
2. **Active Conversations**:

Chat sessions remain active until manually ended by a sub-account user or closed due to inactivity based on your widget’s timeout settings.

3. **Contact Form Fields**:

For Email and WhatsApp Chat, a standard contact form field (e.g., “Message”) is available to capture user information. **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043227227/original/JM1secbGp-8G3-9AGFljGXbMSd7f5zI66g.png?1741875666)**

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. What if I don’t have a WhatsApp number?

You can still use the All-in-One Chat widget with just Live and Email Chat. WhatsApp Chat will be hidden until a valid number is added.

2. Can I customize the color for each channel?

The All-in-One Chat widget applies one unified color scheme across all channels to maintain a consistent brand experience.

3. Do I need separate permissions to set this up?

Typically, users with access to Sites → Chat Widget can create and configure widgets. If you don’t see the option, contact your admin.

4. How do I end a Live Chat session?

Sub-account users can end the session from the Conversations panel in HighLevel, or it will automatically close after the specified inactivity timeout.

* * *

## Troubleshooting

1. #### **Widget Not Showing Up:** Ensure you’ve embedded the widget code on your website correctly. You can find this code under Sites → Chat Widget → Install Code.

2. **WhatsApp Not Available:** Confirm you have an active WhatsApp number. If it’s still not visible, double-check your WhatsApp integration settings.

3. **Email Not Sending:** Make sure your email address is verified and properly set up in your account settings.
