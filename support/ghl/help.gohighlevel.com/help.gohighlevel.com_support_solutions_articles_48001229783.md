#### **What is changing?**

Starting January 26, 2023, all new US A2P 10DLC Campaign registrations (Standard, Low volume standard, and the Sole Proprietor 2.0) will be subject to a manual vetting process and be charged a one-time **$15.75 campaign verification fee** at the time of registration.

#### **Why is this change happening, and is this a LeadConnector-specific requirement?**

This is an industry-wide change to improve the Campaign Vetting process to reduce spam, fraud, and unwanted messaging and protect SMS as a trusted communications channel in the U.S. Every messaging provider who services A2P Campaigns must conduct this vetting.

**Note**: We are collecting the campaign verification fee and will pass that along without markup to our telecommunications partners. The cost is not levied by us directly.

#### **How do the new fees fit in with existing registration fees?**

The below table details the existing registration fees and new registration fees:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Sole Prop** | **Low Volume Standard** | **Standard** |
| **Existing Fee** |  |  |  |
| Brand registration fee (one time) | $4.2 | $4.2 | $4.2 |
| Monthly campaign fee (monthly recurring) | $2.1 | $1.5-$12 (depending on the use case type) | $1.5-$12 (depending on the use case type) |
| **New fee** |  |  |  |
| Campaign verification fee (one time) | $15.75 | $15.75 | $15.75 |

#### **How will this affect Campaign Vetting?**

With this new vetting process, a newly submitted Campaign will be put in a “Pending” state until it has been vetted and approved in the manual vetting process. Customers can only send compliant messages on the A2P route once the Campaign is fully approved.

#### **What will determine whether a Campaign passes or fails this vetting?**

To help ensure your Campaigns are approved in this vetting process, please follow these **[best practices in A2P Campaign Approval Best Practices](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001229784).**

#### **Will I get my $15.75 back if my Campaign fails to vet?**

No, the $15.75 Campaign vetting fee is non-refundable. Telephony System is working on an expedited pre-screening process to catch issues before the Campaign is sent for external vetting. We will share more news on this once we have an update.

#### **Are existing Campaigns affected by this change?**

At this time, only new Campaigns are affected by this change. If this changes for existing Campaigns, we will communicate any new vetting requirements.

#### **Are monthly recurring fees affected by this change?**

No, recurring fees remain the same and are based on the campaign use case.

#### **Do this new vetting process and $15.75 fee also extend to “post-approval” Campaigns like Agents/Franchise and Proxy? If yes, does it occur before the carrier approval, after the carrier approval, or instead of the carrier approval?**

Yes, it applies to post-approval Campaigns. It happens after carrier approval.

#### **What can I do if my campaigns are rejected?**

Contact the support team here so our LC phone specialist team will help you fix your Campaign registration / re-submit a new Campaign which will result in additional charges.

#### **Are there exceptions to these changes?**

[Toll-Free messaging](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204834) remains an attractive alternative to A2P 10DLC. Toll-Free messaging does [require a verification process](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222300) but does not rely on Brand and Campaign registration.
