# **What is WordPress Site Cloning?**

WordPress site cloning is the process of duplicating an existing site to create a new, fully independent copy. This functionality preserves the source site's configurations, themes, plugins, and content. Cloning is especially useful for creating multiple sites with similar layouts, designs, or settings.

* * *

# **Why Clone a WordPress Site?**

- **Efficiency**: Save time by reusing an existing site's setup instead of building from scratch.

- **Consistency**: Ensure uniformity in themes, plugins, and settings across multiple sites.

- **Flexibility**: Create independent sites where changes to one do not affect others.

- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies complex workflows, such as testing updates or creating development environments.

* * *

# **Role-Based Access for Cloning**

Access to the cloning feature is governed by user roles to ensure security. Only users with the following roles can clone WordPress sites:

- **Agency Owners**
- **Agency Users**
- **Account Users** (within the same sub-account)


If a user lacks the necessary permissions, they will only be able to create a new site from scratch. This ensures that only authorized individuals can duplicate sites.

* * *

# **How to Clone a WordPress Site in HighLevel**

1. **Navigate to the WordPress Dashboard**:

   - Log in to your HighLevel account and go to the **WordPress Dashboard**.

   - Choose **Create New** or **Select Blank WordPress**.
2. **Access the Cloning Option**:

   - Click on the **Incomplete Setup Card**.

   - Select **Choose From Existing Site**.
3. **Choose the Source and Destination**:

   - Select the **Sub-Account** where the new site will reside.

   - Choose the **Source Site** you want to clone.

   - Enter a **New Website Name**.
4. **Start Cloning**:

   - Click **Clone** to begin the process.
5. **Monitor the Cloning Progress**:

   - Progress indicators will display the real-time status of the cloning operation.
6. **Review the New Site**:

   - Once the process is complete, your new site will appear as a standalone entity in the WordPress dashboard.

   - Any changes made to the cloned site will not affect the original.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Who can use the cloning feature?**

Only users with specific roles—Agency Owners, Agency Users, and Account Users (within the same sub-account)—can access the cloning functionality.

**Q: What happens if I don’t have the required permissions?**

If your role does not permit cloning, the system will default to the new site creation process instead.

**Q: Will changes to one site affect the other?**

No, the cloned site is completely independent of the original. Modifications to one site will not impact the other.

**Q: Can I track the cloning process?**

Yes, progress indicators display real-time updates during the cloning process.

**Q: What is retained during cloning?**

All configurations, themes, plugins, and settings from the source site are retained in the cloned site.
