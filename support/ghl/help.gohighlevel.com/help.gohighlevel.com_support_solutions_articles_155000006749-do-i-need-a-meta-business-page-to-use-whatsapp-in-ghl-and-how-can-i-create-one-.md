# Do I need a Meta Business Page to use whatsapp in GHL and How can I create one.

Modified on: Tue, 21 Oct, 2025 at 1:42 AM

Yes — to use **WhatsApp with GoHighLevel (GHL)**, you need a **Meta (Facebook) Business Account** in **Meta Business Manager**.

This is required because WhatsApp Business API used by GHL is managed and verified by **Meta**.

> You **don’t need a Facebook Page** for messaging itself — but you **must** have a **Meta Business Account (Business Manager)** to verify your business and connect your WhatsApp number.

* * *

### **Why a Meta Business Account Is Required**

The Meta Business Account (also called **Business Manager** or **Meta Business Suite**) is where Meta:

- Verifies your **business identity**

- Manages your **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)**

- Authorizes **partners like GHL** to send and receive WhatsApp messages through your number

- Stores your **business information**, such as display name, phone number, and policy compliance


Without this setup, your number **can’t be approved for the WhatsApp Business API**, and GHL won’t be able to connect it.

* * *

## **How to Create a Meta Business Account**

Follow these simple steps to create and verify your Meta Business Account:

### **Step 1: Go to Meta Business Suite**

Visit https://business.facebook.com/

Click **“Create account”** if you don’t have one yet.

* * *

### **Step 2: Enter Your Business Details**

You’ll be asked to fill out:

- **Business name** (should match your brand or company name)

- **Your name**

- **Business email address**


Click **“Submit”** to create the account.

* * *

### **Step 3: Verify Your Email**

Meta will send a verification email — click the link in your inbox to confirm your business account.

* * *

### **Step 4: Add Your Business Information**

In your **Meta Business Settings**:

1. Go to **Business Info** (bottom-left corner).

2. Enter your **legal business address**, **website**, and **phone number**.

3. Save changes.


* * *

### **Step 5: Verify Your Business**

Verification may be required for WhatsApp API approval.

To do this:

1. In **Business Settings**, go to **Security Center**.

2. Click **“Start Verification.”**

3. Upload the required business documents (like a registration certificate or utility bill).


> **Meta’s verification can take from a few hours to a few days.**

* * *

### **Step 6: Connect Your WhatsApp Account During GHL Setup**

When you start the WhatsApp setup in GHL:

- You’ll be prompted to **log in with Meta**.

- Choose your **verified Meta Business Account**.

- Select or create a **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)** inside it.

- Add your number and complete the verification (SMS or call code).


Once verified, your WhatsApp number will be live inside GoHighLevel!
