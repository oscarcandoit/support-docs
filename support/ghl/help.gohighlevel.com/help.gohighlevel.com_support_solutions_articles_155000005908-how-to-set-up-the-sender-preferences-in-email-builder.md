# **What are Sender Preferences in Email Builder?**

Sender Preferences allow you to define the default **From Name, From Email, Reply-To, and Test Recipient(s)** for emails created in the Email Builder. These defaults automatically populate in your test sends and new marketing campaigns, saving time and ensuring that sender details remain consistent across your communications. By setting them once, you reduce repetitive typing and lower the risk of mistakes, such as typos or mismatched sender information.

These defaults act as a **starting point**—they auto-fill when you create a new campaign or test, but you can still override them for individual sends when needed. It’s important to know that updates to Sender Preferences will only apply to new campaigns or tests you create; existing drafts and scheduled emails will keep their current settings unless you update them manually. This makes Sender Preferences a powerful tool for efficiency and brand consistency while still giving you flexibility when specific campaigns require unique sender details.

## **Key Benefits of Sender Preferences**

Using Sender Preferences in Email Builder helps teams save time, reduce errors, and keep campaigns consistent. Here’s how this feature addresses common challenges in email marketing:

- **Faster Setup** – Stop retyping sender details for every campaign. Your default From Name, Email, and Reply-To auto-fill instantly, so you can launch faster.

- **Error Reduction** – Avoid typos or inconsistent sender information across emails. Defaults ensure every campaign starts with accurate, brand-approved details.

- **Brand Consistency** – Present a uniform sender identity to your audience. Consistent “From” information builds trust and strengthens brand recognition.

- **Efficient Testing** – Store QA inboxes as Test Recipient(s), so proof emails always go to the right people without needing to enter addresses manually.

- **Flexible Control** – Even with defaults in place, you can override sender details per campaign when special branding, teams, or replies require adjustments.

# **How to Configure the Sender Preferences in Email Builder**

### **Open Emails**

From your dashboard, click **Marketing** in the left-hand menu, then select **Emails** at the top. This takes you into the Email Builder where campaigns are created and managed.

### **Open Campaigns**

Inside **Email Marketing**, click the **Campaigns** tab at the top. This section lists all active and draft campaigns and is where you’ll manage email settings.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155051777029/original/WJRkB7NwZpG1jIBJCTKfDuSJ8K1IGQCxug.png?1755502668)

### **Open Settings**

In the **Campaigns** view, click the **gear (Settings)** icon in the top-right corner. This opens the configuration panel where you can access and manage sender preferences.

### **Sender Preferences**

From the **Settings** menu, select **Sender Preferences** in the left sidebar. This will open the form where you can configure and manage your default sender details for all email campaigns and test emails.

### **Sender Name**

Enter the **Sender Name** that recipients will see in their inbox (for example, your brand name or a team member’s name). Keeping this name consistent helps build trust and recognition. The field shows a short helper note (“The name recipient will see”) to remind you of its purpose.

On the right, the **tag icon** allows you to insert a dynamic value, such as a custom field, instead of typing a static name. This is useful if you want the sender name to adapt automatically based on the campaign or account settings.

### **Sender Email**

The **Sender Email** is the address that appears in the “From” line of your emails. Recipients will see this address as the source of the message, so it’s important to use one that looks professional and matches your verified sending domain.

The field also shows a verification status just below it (e.g., **“Email verified”**) to confirm that the email address is authenticated and safe to use. On the right, the **tag icon** lets you insert a dynamic value instead of typing a fixed email. This can be useful if campaigns need to pull a sender email automatically from account or user data.

### **Test Recipient(s)**

The **Test Recipient (To)** field allows you to specify up to **5 email addresses**, separated by commas, where test emails will be sent before a campaign goes live. This is especially useful for quality assurance, proofreading, or checking formatting across different inboxes before sending to your audience.

You can add personal inboxes, QA team emails, or stakeholder addresses here. On the right, the **tag icon** lets you insert dynamic values if needed, instead of typing them manually. Setting these test addresses ensures that mistakes are caught early and campaigns are polished before launch.

### **Custom Reply-To**

The **Custom Reply** field lets you enter a different email address where recipient replies will be sent, instead of the default sender email. For example, you may want your newsletters to show as coming from **marketing@yourdomain.com**, but have replies directed to **support@yourdomain.com** or a shared inbox your team monitors.

This helps you separate outbound emails from inbound queries, ensuring that replies don’t get lost and are routed to the right team or mailbox. If left blank, replies will default to the sender email.

### **Save**

Once you’ve entered all your Sender Preferences — including Sender Name, Sender Email, Test Recipient(s), and Custom Reply — click the **Save** button to apply your settings. Saving ensures these values are stored as your default configuration for new campaigns and test sends.

```
Important: Updating Sender Preferences does not retroactively update existing campaigns or scheduled emails. Always double-check sender fields before launching to avoid incorrect details being used.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: If I update my Sender Preferences, will existing scheduled campaigns automatically use the new defaults?**

No. Sender Preferences only apply when creating **new campaigns or test emails**. Existing scheduled campaigns or drafts keep their original sender details unless manually updated.

**Q: What happens if I clone a campaign that was created before I updated Sender Preferences?**

Clones inherit the **original campaign’s stored sender values**, not your new defaults. Always review and update the **From Name, From Email, and Reply-To** fields after cloning.

**Q: How do Sender Preferences interact with multiple brands or domains inside the same account?**

Sender Preferences set **account-level defaults**. If you manage multiple brands, manually override sender details per campaign. Best practice: set the most-used identity as your default.

**Q: Could mismatched Sender Email and Reply-To values affect deliverability or spam filtering?**

Yes. Email providers may flag mismatches as suspicious. For best inboxing, ensure your **Sender Email domain is authenticated** and your **Reply-To** address is on the same monitored domain.
