## **What is the Announcement Channel?**

The Announcement Channel is a specialized read-only channel in HighLevel Communities, designed to help community admins and owners deliver important updates without interference from general discussions. With role-based access control, this feature ensures that announcements remain focused, organized, and highly visible to all members.

## **Key Benefits of Announcement Channels**

Announcement Channels offer a powerful way to streamline communication and maintain focus within your community.

- Prevents important messages from getting lost in active chat discussions

- Empowers admins and owners with exclusive posting access

- Offers both **public** and **private** visibility settings

- Allows key messages to be **pinned** at the top for quick access

- Channels can be reverted to a regular format with member posting rights

- Keeps communication clean and distraction-free


## **How to Create and Use the Announcement Channel**

3. Toggle **Enable as Announcement Channel**.

4. Choose if the channel should be **Public** (visible to all members) or **Private** (restricted to selected users).

5. Save changes and start posting updates.
