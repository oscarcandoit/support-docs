# How to Build Recipient Segments in Email Campaigns

Modified on: Tue, 10 Jun, 2025 at 8:44 AM

This article will walk you through how to build Segments in HighLevel for use in your email campaigns. Segments let you filter contacts based on live conditions like tags, activity, or location. They automatically update in real-time, ensuring your audience list is always relevant and up to date.

# **What is a Segment?**

Segments are dynamic contact groups created using filters such as email activity, tags, contact fields, or engagement. Unlike static lists, Segments update automatically as contacts enter or exit the defined criteria.

This makes Segments incredibly useful for email marketing—allowing you to target specific groups of contacts who meet certain behaviors or demographics at any given time.

## **Key Benefits of Using Segments**

Segments help you personalize and automate email campaigns with precision. They ensure your messages go to the most relevant audience—boosting open rates, click-through rates, and conversions.

- Automatically refresh based on contact behavior and attributes

- Save time by reusing Segments across different campaigns

- Reduce bounce rates by excluding inactive or unqualified leads

- Combine multiple filter conditions with AND/OR logic

- Increase email relevance through better targeting

- Eliminate the need for manual contact updates


## **How to Build a Segment**

Building a Segment allows you to create a dynamic group of contacts using filters like tags, activity history, and location—so you always email the right people at the right time.

### **? Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Navigate to**: Marketing > Emails > Campaigns

2. **Create** a new campaign or click on an existing one to edit

3. Click **“Add Segment”** in the Audience section

4. Choose your filters. You can combine logic like:

   - Tag is “Active Client”

   - AND Last Email Opened is within 7 days

   - OR State is Texas
5. Use **“Add Filter”** or **“Add OR Filter”** to build complex conditions

6. Click **Save Segment**

7. Give the Segment a clear name like “Active Clients in Texas - Engaged” and save it


## **Smart Lists vs Segments**

While both Smart Lists and Segments help you group contacts, they are used in different areas of HighLevel and serve distinct purposes.

Smart Lists are found in the Contact Manager and allow you to save custom views based on filters. Segments, on the other hand, are used in the email campaign builder to dynamically select contacts at the time of sending.

| **Feature** | **Smart Lists** | **Segments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location | Contact Manager | Campaign Builder |
| Auto-Updating? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Manual Inclusion? | ✅ Yes (via Tag) | ❌ No (logic only) |
| Reusable? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Workflow Compatible? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I reuse the same segment in different campaigns?**

Yes. When you save a Segment, it becomes available for use across multiple campaigns.

**Q: Are Segments live-updating or static?**

Segments update in real time. As contact data changes, Segments automatically reflect those changes.

**Q: Can I use OR logic in Segments?**

Yes, use the **“Add OR Filter”** button to include OR conditions alongside AND logic.

**Q: What’s the difference between Smart Lists and Segments?**

Smart Lists are CRM-based and can be used for general filtering. Segments are campaign-focused and ideal for live filtering during email sends.

**Q: Can I manually add or remove contacts from a Segment?**

No. Segments only include contacts that meet your defined filter criteria. For manual grouping, consider using **Tags** or Smart Lists.

### **Next Steps**

- Add more conditions to fine-tune audience targeting

- Combine Segments with email A/B tests for better results

- Explore how Segments can trigger automations in Workflows

- Tag contacts based on Segment inclusion using automation rules
