# Finding the Pipeline and Stage ID using zapier

Modified on: Mon, 2 Jun, 2025 at 7:28 AM

If you do not wish to use Zapier for Stage ID and Pipeline ID, in HighLevel the only way to get that information is by exporting opportunities.

```

IMPORTANT: Stage name is enough to create opportunities so we dont really need the Stage ID anymore.

**About pipeline ID and opportunity ID**

So opportunity ID can be found in 2 other ways

1. By clicking on any opportunity modal, the opportunity id is mentioned in the bottom left. Refer to the text on the bottom left which looks like a link.

2. it is also the end of the URL when you open an opportunity.

## **Uses of Pipleline ID and Stage ID**

1. Pipeline ID can be used to check audit logs for any edits made to a certain pipeline

2. Opportunity ID can be used for :
1. Tracking activity in audit logs
2. Redirecting user to a particular opportunity
3. Updating an opportunity using import

Apart from this, all these IDs are also widely used in webhooks and APIs
