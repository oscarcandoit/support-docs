# **Overview of Billing Dashboard**

The Billing section within each sub-account serves as the central hub for all financial activities. It offers a user-friendly interface to:

1. Manage Subscriptions
2. Payment Methods
3. Billing Information
4. Transaction History
5. and Wallet Balances.

This centralized approach ensures that all billing-related tasks are accessible and manageable in one place.

# **Manage Subscriptions**

In the Billing section, you can oversee all active subscriptions associated with the sub-account, including:

- **SaaS Subscriptions:** Manage software-as-a-service subscriptions tailored to your business needs.

- **Reselling Subscriptions:** Handle subscriptions related to reselling services.

- **Marketplace App Subscriptions:** Oversee subscriptions for various marketplace applications integrated into your workflow.

This consolidated view allows for efficient monitoring and management of all your subscriptions.

# **Payment Methods**

The Payment Methods area enables you to:

- **Add New Cards:** Introduce new payment methods as needed.

# **Update Billing Information**

Maintaining accurate billing information is crucial for compliance and successful transactions. Within the Billing section, you can:

- **Update Billing Address:** Modify your billing address to reflect current information, which is essential in regions where accurate billing details are mandatory for recurring products.

This feature empowers you to keep your billing information current without external assistance.

# **View Charges and Transaction History**

Transparency in financial transactions is vital. The Billing section provides:

- **Detailed Charges Overview:** Access a comprehensive list of all charges incurred.

- **Invoices:** View and download invoices for your records.

- **Transaction History:** Review past transactions to monitor spending and manage finances effectively.

# **Understanding Wallet Balances**

The Wallet feature allows you to add a bulk amount of money to your account in a single transaction, and that money is then converted into credits. When you use services that would cost your account money, you would spend credits instead.

Once your wallet credits go below a certain amount (determined by the account user/owner), your default credit card will automatically be charged and more credits will be added to your wallet, preventing any interruption from paid services.

Some of the benefits of the wallet system are:

- **View Current Balance:** See your available funds at a glance.

- **Monitor Complimentary Credits:** Track any complimentary credits provided.

- **Manage Funds:** Add funds to your wallet to ensure uninterrupted services.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Why aren’t my customers receiving receipts for wallet reloads or SaaS plan rebills?**

Customers do not automatically receive receipts for wallet credit reloads (e.g. $25 top-ups for usage like SMS or email). These wallet transactions are visible to the agency but are not sent to the client by default. For SaaS plan rebills, receipts are handled by Stripe. To ensure clients receive them, go to your Stripe account > Settings > Email Receipts, and enable receipt emails for successful payments.

**Q: How can I add a new payment method?**

Navigate to the Payment Methods section within the Billing area, click on 'Add New Card,' and enter the required card details.

**Q: Is it possible to have multiple active subscriptions?**

Yes, you can manage multiple subscriptions, including SaaS, Reselling, and Marketplace apps, all from the Subscriptions section.

**Q: How do I update my billing address?**

In the Billing section, locate the Billing Information area and click on 'Edit' to update your billing address.

**Q: Where can I view my past invoices?**

Access the Charges and Transaction History section within Billing to view and download past invoices.

**Q: How do I add funds to my wallet?**

In the Wallet section, click on 'Add Funds' and follow the prompts to add the desired amount to your wallet balance.
