# Mobile: AutoPayment in Recurring Invoices

Modified on: Fri, 22 Aug, 2025 at 10:45 AM

Mobile Auto-Payment for recurring invoices in HighLevel automates card charging on a set schedule, so you collect on time without manual follow-ups. Turn it on from the mobile send flow, choose a saved card or a customer card you’ve captured, and let billing run itself. This guide explains what it is, how it works with POS, and how to set it up.

## **What is Auto-Payment for Recurring Invoices (Mobile)?**

Auto-Payment automatically charges a customer’s **card** for each occurrence of a **recurring invoice** you send from the HighLevel mobile app. You decide the charge source—either a **Saved Card** already on file or a **Customer Card** captured during checkout—then the system processes future payments on the schedule you define.

* * *

## **Prerequisites**

- Recurring invoice created via the Invoices or POS module.

- Customer payment method on file (Card on File, or online card capture).

- Payments must be via card — Auto-Payment is not available for cash or manual entry.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Auto-Payment for Recurring Invoices**

Understanding the benefits helps you decide when to enable Auto-Payment and which payment source to use for the smoothest customer experience and most reliable collections.

- Hands-free collections: payments run on each billing date automatically.

- Multiple payment sources: choose a Saved Card on file or a Customer Card you captured via checkout.

- Frictionless experience: no extra steps for the customer after the initial payment.

- Predictable cash flow: scheduled, on-time charges reduce revenue gaps.

- Less admin work: set it once during scheduling; no chasing or manual charges.

* * *

## **Payment Method Options**

Picking the right payment source ensures successful charges and fewer declines. Below are the available options and when to use them.

- **Saved Card:** Charge any card already stored on the contact. Ideal when you’ve previously added a card on file and want the most reliable, “set-and-forget” billing.
- **Customer Card:** Use the card captured during Tap to Pay, Card on File, or online checkout. Helpful if you just took a payment in person or online and want to continue charging that same card for future cycles.

```
Please Note: Auto-Payment on mobile supports card payments. Cash and manual entry aren’t supported for Auto-Payment.
```

## **How To Set Up Auto-Payment for Recurring Invoices**

```
IMPORTANT: To get started, Create a Go to Invoices or POS and start a recurring invoice, add details, select a customer, items, and billing frequency. For this step refer to How to create recurring Invoices.
