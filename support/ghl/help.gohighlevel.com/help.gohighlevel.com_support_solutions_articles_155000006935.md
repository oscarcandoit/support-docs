# **What Is the SEO Report in WordPress Hosting?**

The SEO Report centralizes core on‑page SEO checks directly inside the WordPress Hosting dashboard for each hosted site. It highlights missing or weak metadata and provides practical, guided actions so you can resolve issues quickly without third‑party tools.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the SEO Report in WordPress Hosting**

- **Time to Value:** Quickly identify and resolve high‑impact SEO opportunities from a single dashboard.

- **Workflow Efficiency:** Guided fixes reduce context switching and accelerate completion.

- **Better SERP Outcomes:** Improving core metadata increases relevance and can lift click‑through potential.

- **Operational Simplicity:** See insights where you manage hosting—fewer tools and logins to juggle.

- **Reduced Risk of Oversights:** Automated checks surface gaps often missed in manual reviews.

* * *

## **Core SEO Checks**

Learning what gets checked and why it matters helps you interpret the insights and decide which fixes will produce the biggest search impact.

### **Title Tags**

- **Detects:** Missing titles, duplicates, and titles that exceed recommended length guidelines.

- **Why it matters:** Titles influence rankings, click‑through rate (CTR), and how your page is interpreted by search engines.

- **What to do:** Use **Fix Now** to open the relevant edit view and craft a concise, descriptive title that reflects primary intent.

### **Meta Descriptions**

- **Detects:** Missing or unoptimized descriptions.

- **Why it matters:** Descriptions can improve SERP engagement by previewing value and encouraging clicks.

- **What to do:** Use **Fix Now** to add a clear, benefit‑oriented summary that aligns with the page title and content.

### **Meta Keywords**

- **Detects:** Opportunities to refine keyword focus and topical relevance based on your content.

- **Why it matters:** While major search engines may not use meta keywords for rankings, keyword focus remains valuable for content planning and internal consistency.

- **What to do:** Use **Fix Now** to review suggested keywords and ensure your on‑page copy aligns with the topic.

## **Prerequisites and Access**

Verifying requirements upfront prevents access issues and ensures the SEO tab can load and display insights for your site.

You’ll need:

- **Active SEO subscription at the sub‑account level**. If SEO is not subscribed for the sub‑account, the SEO tab will not be visible under WordPress Hosting.





  - **How to Confirm:** **Agency View** \> **Sub-accounts** \> **Manage Client** \> **Reselling** \> **SEO**

**![](https://jumpshare.com/share/NhGPrSLFRELmetmyAG7y+/Screen+Shot+2025-11-10+at+8.38.21+PM.png)**

- **LC (LeadConnector) WordPress Plugin v3.0.12 or later**, installed and active on the WordPress site to enable insights and ensure API compatibility.




  - **How to Confirm: Sites > WordPress >** Click **Manage Website** button of the particular website **>** **Plugins**
