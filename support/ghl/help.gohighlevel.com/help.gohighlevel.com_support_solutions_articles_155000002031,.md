# Sub-Account Transfer Guide

Modified on: Fri, 25 Jul, 2025 at 6:35 AM

A sub-account transfer is the movement of a sub-account from one Agency (Releasing Agency) to another Agency (Receiving Agency). It is not a merge, we cannot merge the data of one sub-account and put it in another, nor can we transfer the sub-account partially (some data not other).

**Both Agencies are not on LeadConnector (Either one or Both are Twilio)**

No phone numbers will be transferred over by HighLevel. It is your responsibility to work with the previous account owner as well as Twilio to move over any or all phone numbers that you may want to keep connected to the transferred sub-account.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I merge one Sub-Account with another?**

No. Sub-Account transfers are a movement of the entire sub-account, not a movement of just the data inside of it. This movement takes place from one agency to another.

**Q: Can I transfer a HIPAA-enabled Sub-account?**We can ONLY Transfer HIPAA-compliant sub-accounts if the Agency that you are wanting to transfer to ALSO has the HIPAA Compliance add-on package purchased from the HighLevel Marketplace before the transfer is made.

**Q: What is the prep that I have to do to the sub-account before transferring?**

- Set all users that you want to be transferred over are User Type ‘Account’ and only assigned to this specific sub-account being transferred.
- Any SaaS sub-account will need to have SaaS disabled.
- All active subscriptions like Wordpress, Listings, Whatsapp, Dedicated IP etc. will have to be cancelled before the transfer is requested.


**Q: What is the setup that I will need once the transfer is made?**

- You will need to reconnect all auth connections (ex: Google, FB, Quickbooks, Clio, DrChrono)
- You will have to reintegrate Facebook and Google
- You will have setup the sub-account-level Stripe
- You will have to re-add LC Email, Mailgun/SMTP, and Twilio
- You will have to re-add your domains
- Any SaaS sub-accounts will have to have SaaS re-enabled.


**Q: What can I do to transfer sub-accounts in bulk?**

We do support Bulk Location Transfer in-app. Please refer to the help article below for the steps to follow.
