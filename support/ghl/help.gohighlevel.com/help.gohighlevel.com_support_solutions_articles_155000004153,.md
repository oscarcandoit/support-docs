# Membership: New UI for Courses

Modified on: Mon, 11 Nov, 2024 at 6:15 AM

In this article, we’re excited to introduce the brand-new Courses mobile UI, crafted to make learning smoother, faster, and more enjoyable. Discover the latest updates that bring a fresh, user-friendly experience to your mobile learning journey.

1\. Seamless Category and Lesson Navigation

Easily switch between categories and lessons on the same screen! Expand to dive deep, or collapse for a quickglance at the essentials. No more back-and-forth hassle!

2\. Effortless Learning for All Types of Lessons

Whether it’s text, audio, or video—our fresh design keeps it simple and intuitive for every lesson type. Learning has never been this easy-breezy!

3.All-New Comments Section

Engage with your peers like never before! Our redesigned comments section lets you easily reply and keep the conversation flowing.

4.Sleek Quizzes & Assignments Interface.

No more content cropping or confusing transitions! Effortlessly switch between questions, and enjoy a seamless quiz and assignment experience.

5\. Quick Status Overview

Keep tabs on your progress at a glance—find out whether your quizzes and assignments are in review, passed, or (gulp) failed!

6\. Shimmers, Not Loaders!

Loading times just got a glow-up! We’ve swapped out the old-school loaders for sleek, shimmering placeholders to keep things looking smooth and modern while your content loads. No more staring at boring spinners!

7.Code Structure

Improved folder structure and converted code to Vue 3 composition api for better maintainability and readability.

8.Reduced Bundle Size

Structured pages into multiple sub components and lazy loaded them to reduce overall initial bundle size.
