## Overview

The Payments feature in Forms gives you the ability to:

- Collect **donations** (suggested or custom amounts).

- Enable **recurring contributions** like subscriptions.

- Sell products with **manual payment methods** such as cash or bank transfer.

- Track and manage all payments through the unified **Payments dashboard**.


* * *

## Available Payment Types

You can accept payments in multiple ways, depending on your setup:

- **Online Payments** (via connected gateways like Stripe, Authorize.net, NMI).

- **Manual Payments** (offline methods).

  - **Cash on Delivery (COD):** Customer pays in cash at delivery.

  - **Custom Payment Methods:** Includes bank transfer, checks, or other offline arrangements.

* * *

## Donation Amount Options

### Suggest an Amount Customization

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054677894/original/GQGfEt3FAM5Jfu67kOrXPw8K481ktGXAIA.png?1758889763)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054677937/original/gFkQx0ghwhhvfWpNp501zRIAzkx8r9d3NQ.png?1758889784)

Let donors choose from suggested amounts in their preferred currency:

- Add up to **15 suggested amounts**.

- Select a **currency** from the dropdown.

- Enable the **“Other Amount”** option for flexibility.

- Customize the label/tag that displays when a user selects an amount.

- Suggested amount styling automatically matches your form’s theme.


* * *

### User-Defined Amount

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054678026/original/KpGiXmdYu-VowtFrzXp-o2QdWrsqFikUSg.png?1758889818)

If you don’t use suggested amounts, the **User-Defined Amount** option is enabled automatically:

- Donors can enter their own amount.

- A placeholder can be added to guide them on what to enter.


* * *

### Recurring Donations

The **Recurring Donation** feature lets customers subscribe to donations on a repeating schedule.

**How it works:**

1. Add the **Custom Amount** element to your form.

2. Enable the **Recurring Payment toggle**.

3. Choose available billing frequencies (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055401316/original/sBHoS3LWRPa6V7_hJelpl4BvKMR4VHHkpQ.png?1759832782)

**Customer Experience:**

- Donors pick an amount and billing frequency.

- They subscribe once, and payments recur automatically.


**Why it matters:**

- Simplifies the donor journey.

- Encourages repeat contributions.

- Helps grow your **Total Payment Volume (TPV)**.


* * *

## How Manual Payments Work

Manual payment methods allow you to sell products through forms and surveys while collecting payments offline. Find the detailed article on manual payments [here.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004657-manual-payment-support-for-forms-surveys)

### 1\. Enable Manual Payments

- Go to **Payments > Integrations > Manual Payment Methods**.

- Enable **Cash on Delivery** or **Custom Payment Methods**.

- Configure descriptions and post-purchase messages.

- Ensure manual payment options are enabled specifically for forms and surveys.


### 2\. Automatic Display in Forms & Surveys

- When a product is added to a form or survey, the manual payment option appears automatically in the payment selection.


### 3\. Order Processing & Payment Collection

- When a form is submitted with manual payment selected, the order shows in **Payments > Orders** with a **Pending** status.

- Businesses can then mark the order as **Paid** and select the payment mode (cash, card, check, bank transfer, etc.).

- The updated payment status syncs automatically with the **Form Submissions** section.


* * *

## Tracking Payments

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054678185/original/ni3D60ydN4iUo9IzTDHuKO_HJddZNjsy9g.png?1758889842)

You can monitor all payments in one place:

- View payment details directly in **form submission data**.

- Access full transaction history under **Payments > Transactions**.

- Export payment details as needed.

- See real-time status (successful, pending).


* * *

## Email Notifications

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054678238/original/J_rv8qm_8NdEKULMVo_cHDhUQxsTYn4HGQ.jpeg?1758889881)

Enable **autoresponders and email notifications** for payment-enabled forms:

- Notifications include payment amount and status.

- Keeps both you and your customers informed instantly.


* * *

## Benefits & Use Cases

- **Greater Flexibility:** Accept both online and offline payments.

- **Recurring Support:** Encourage ongoing contributions with automated recurring billing.

- **Seamless Order Tracking:** Unified dashboard for forms, orders, and payments.

- **Automatic Sync:** Payment status updates reflect in both **Orders** and **Submissions**.

- **Ideal for Cash-Based Businesses:** Perfect for businesses relying on COD or offline methods.


* * *

## Important Notes

- **NMI** and **Authorize.net** require **First Name** as a mandatory field.

- Refunds are **not supported** at this time.

- The old **API-based Stripe Connect** method is no longer supported.

- In calendars with custom form payments, the **Payment element will not display**.

- **Multi-payments** across multiple forms in funnels are not yet supported.

- **Undo/Redo** is not available with the Payment element.


* * *
