## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I download or export my analytics data?** Currently, exporting is not available from the Messaging Analytics UI. You can take screenshots or refer to detailed logs in the conversations tab.

**Q: Why don’t I see any messages listed under a campaign or workflow?**

Ensure that messages are properly tagged with campaign or workflow IDs during creation. Also confirm that the selected date range includes the expected activity.

**Q: How often is the data updated in Messaging Analytics?**

The analytics dashboard updates in near real-time, but delays may occur depending on message volume and carrier feedback.

**Q: What should I do if my delivery rate drops suddenly?**

Check for recent content changes, review Error codes, and validate that your sending practices comply with the LC Messaging Policy.

**Q: Can I filter by phone number or contact?**

Not currently. Messaging Analytics filters work at the campaign, workflow, bulk request, and date level only.

**Q: What’s the difference between 'Failed' and 'Error' statuses?**

'Failed' refers to delivery attempts that didn’t reach recipients (e.g., invalid numbers), while 'Error' typically reflects carrier-specific rejections or system issues.

**Q: Why is Opt-Out tracking important?**

It helps you identify recipients who’ve unsubscribed, allowing you to adjust messaging strategies and ensure compliance.
