## **How to use the Hosted Video Feature**

**Step 1:**

- To make use of the Hosted Video feature, **add a video Element** to your funnel.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48263987310/original/VnPpKixTTumIYcjEkWOvE2Oqm0Aa5tuCAg.png?1668693872)

**Step 2:**

- Click on the Video Element, Go to **Video Settings** on the left and scroll down to **Video Type** \> Choose **Hosted Video**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48263987868/original/2avejriMf-Jluly1dckklYBs4B0nkH8bZw.png?1668693968)

**Step 3:**

- Then click on **Select Video** to be taken to your **Media Library**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48263988423/original/klhhSEr3nXFnE4dsWmo3K1g0443jM6LphA.png?1668694098)**

**Step 4:**

- If you do not already have the video that you need to host, Please **Upload** it.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48263988778/original/NQzSWrbhOKDkGOib8IdshXYAT62i9wVpQg.png?1668694174)

```
Please Note: The video can be in any of the mainstream Video formats as long as it is under 4GB.
```

**Step 5:**

- Once your video is done uploading, you can double-click on the Video file to begin **Encoding** it.


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48263989442/original/odjpw6Z-XA46FTXMCTlRnh4yc420RG7DmA.png?1668694300)

```
Note: You can learn more about why a video needs to be encoded for Video Tracking by clicking here. Users can retry encoding by reselecting the video if the video encoding is in failed state. All videos that are in processing for more than a day will automatically get marked as failed.
It is also required so that your viewers can see an option to choose between multiple video qualities. Raw videos can only play in one quality.

## **What do each of the toggles in the Hosted Video Element settings > Playback Controls do?**

### **Autoplay:**  **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48263993735/original/k0ZU3XqKsi24uyp5x8s87A4gUTturicrrA.png?1668695049)**    **Please Note:**

```
According to autoplay regulations autoplaying videos on IOS, Safari, Chrome, Android, Firefox, and Edge must start out muted. This policy is controlled by the browser manufacturers, and all video hosting services must adhere to it.

Here are links to the policy change for each browser:
Autoplaying video policy for IOS
Autoplaying video policy for Safari
Autoplaying video policy for Chrome
Autoplaying video policy for Android
Autoplaying video policy for Firefox
Autoplaying video policy for Edge

Chrome will rely on your viewer’s Media Engagement Index to decide if it will autoplay a video with sound or not. Chrome calculates a media engagement score which is highest on sites where media is played on a regular basis. When it is high enough, media playback is allowed to autoplay with sound on desktop only.

Non auto-played videos start unmuted.
```

If people land on your video page directly using a URL and they are not a contact in the system have not filled out their name and information on an opt-in form. Plan to track a visitor's video viewing progress but have landed on the video directly. Your video progress tracking workflow will not provide their name and details to give you valuable stats for a named contact. The workflow would then be adding blank leads to itself.

To avoid such a situation, the Redirect Unregistered Visitors toggle can be used to push such visitors to another page with an Opt-In Form so that they can fill in their name and other details; once they do that, they would be brought back to the video. This redirect only pushes those visitors to your designated page with no cookies attached to them, which would have otherwise contained information about them.

If a visitor does not allow your site to add cookies to their browser, this redirect may not work. Please be sure to specify which Step/Page you want to Redirect them to:

## **Troubleshooting: Encoded Video Not Selectable**

If your video appears as "encoded" in the Media Library but cannot be selected when embedding into a funnel page, try the following steps:

- **Wait a few minutes:** The encoding process may still be completing in the background, even if it appears finished.

- **Refresh the page:** Reload the funnel editor or Media Library to see if the video becomes available.

- **Retry encoding:** If the issue persists, try reselecting the file in the Media Library to prompt a new encoding attempt.

- **Check file format and size:** Ensure your video meets the [supported media requirements](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001216629-media-library-specs-formats), including format (e.g., .mp4) and size (must be under 4GB).
