# Prospecting at Sub Accounts: Complete Guide Benefits & Setup

Modified on: Wed, 10 Sep, 2025 at 5:43 AM

**Prospecting at sub account level enables you to do more advanced prospecting from finding new leads, nurturing and outreach them seamlessly at one place. Therefore now Prospecting is available in** two areas:

1. **In Agency** – for lead discovery and basic prospecting
2. **In Sub-Account** – for advanced engagement and automation (Add Leads to Contact, Setup Workflow Automations for outreach, import to opportunities etc)

> **Only Sub-Accounts** can send emails, SMS, and run workflows. That’s why prospecting efforts are most powerful when done (or migrated) inside a sub-account.
