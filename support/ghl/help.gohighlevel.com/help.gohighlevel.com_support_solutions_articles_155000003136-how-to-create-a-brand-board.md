# **What is a Brand Board?**

A Brand Board in HighLevel is a centralized space where you can define and manage your brand's visual identity. Each Brand Board contains a Design Kit that includes your logos, brand colors, and typography choices. Once set up, these assets can be easily applied across various parts of your account for a cohesive brand look.

## **Key Benefits of Brand Boards**

- **Brand Consistency:** A brand board keeps all your visual elements in one place, so you use the same logo, colors, and fonts everywhere. This helps make sure that your brand looks the same whether it’s on your website, in your emails, or on social media.

- **Time Efficiency:** Instead of hunting for your logo files or trying to remember your brand’s color codes, a brand board lets you access everything quickly. This makes creating new materials faster and simpler.

- **Easy Management:** Managing your brand’s visual elements is a breeze with a brand board. You can quickly find and use your logos, colors, and fonts, making sure everything stays consistent and on-brand.

Use the three-dot menu and click Set as Default.

**Q: Can I edit my Brand Board later?**

Yes, click the three-dot menu next to the Brand Board and select Edit.

You can add up to 5 fonts, 10 colors and 2 logos in a brand board

**Q: Where will I see the logos added?**
