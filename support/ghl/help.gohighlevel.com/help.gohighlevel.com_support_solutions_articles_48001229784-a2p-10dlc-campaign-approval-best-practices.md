# **A2P 10DLC Campaign Approval Requirements**

On January 26, 2023, a new A2P 10DLC Campaign vetting process went into effect. For details on the change, see this article. This change is relevant to customers using long code numbers to send messages to the United States, under the A2P 10DLC framework.

Effective January 26, 2023, newly registered A2P Campaigns are subject to a manual vetting process. **To help ensure your Campaigns are approved in this vetting process, please follow these best practices when submitting new Campaigns.**

```

## **Data Accuracy and Consistency Best Practices**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ### ****Best Practice**** | ### ****Examples**** |
| Consistency across brand, website, and sample messages | ✅ **Example 1:**Best Chance for Approval<br>**\- Brand name:** _Acme_<br>**\- Website:**_www.acme.com_<br>**\- Sample****message:** _“Here’s your one-time passcode for logging into_ __www.acme.com_.__”_<br>❌ **Example 2:**Will Be Rejected<br>**\- Brand name:** _ABC Marketing_<br>**\- Website:**_www.acme.com_<br>**\- Sample****message:** _“Here’s your one-time passcode for logging into___www.contoso.com_.__”_ |
| Consistency between your sample messages and use cases | **❌ Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I** **f:**<br>\- You register a marketing campaign but sample messages say, **_“Here’s your one-time passcode: 123456”_**, which would clearly indicate some sort of login process. |
| Consistency in email domain and company name | **❌ Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I** **f...**<br>**\- Your Brand:** _LeadConnector Inc_<br>**\- Email in A2P Application:** _LeadConnectorInc@gmail.com_<br>✅ Your email address should consist of your branded domain, for example: **_JohnF@LeadConnectorInc.com_**<br>\*Note that this check only applies to large, well-known corporations that should have dedicated email domains |
| Make sure you submit real, working websites | **❌** **Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I****f...**<br>Your customers use your website to opt-in to your messages, but the website address you provide in your A2P application does not work. |
| Make sure the brand you register is the actual brand that will be sending messages to consumers | **❌ Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I** **f...**<br>**Company Information Registered in A2P Application:**<br>Your marketing agency or software company’s information (e.g., a company that provides the tech for dental offices)<br>**Messages Sent From:**<br>Your customer (e.g., individual dentist practices) |
| Make sure you create as few duplicate brands and campaigns as possible | Excessive brands with the same EIN and excessive campaigns with the same campaign attributes **may be seen as high-risk and may result in campaign****rejection.** |
| For templated messages, indicate the templated fields in your sample messages with brackets \[Like This\] to help reviewers better identify which parts are templated. | **✅ For Example:**<br>- “Dental check due for **\[Mary Doe\]**, Visit **\[www.contoso.com****\]** to schedule an appointment or call **\[123-456-7890\]**” |

* * *

## **Collecting Consent Best Practices**

```
Please refer to the CTIA guidelines for detailed instructions and best practices on handling consumer consent.
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ### ****Best Practice**** | ### ****Example****s**** |
| Make sure consumer opt-in is collected appropriately | **❌** **Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I****f...**<br>**Your Defined Opt-In Method When Registering:**<br>Text message<br>**Y** **our Sample Message When Registering:**<br>“Hi, is this the owner of 123 Oak Street? I’d like to discuss how I can help you sell your property”<br>\*It is clear that you have not collected appropriate consent before sending messages |
| Opt-in language MUST be available on your website if during registration you indicated that a consumer opts into your campaign on your company website | **❌** **Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I****f...**<br>If your brand Acme uses its website, www.acme.com, to collect phone numbers but your website does not contain opt-in language.<br>**Example Opt-In Language:**<br>“By providing your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from ACME. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies.” |
| We recommend having opt-out language in at least one of your sample messages. | **For example, add****language such as:**<br>“Please reply STOP to opt-out” in one of your sample messages. |

|     |
| --- |
| **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:**<br>- Brands cannot submit Campaigns using **\[company name\]** and will need to update their flows to have their own **BRAND NAME** rather than **"the company"** or **"the business"**<br>- Brands cannot use HighLevel's **demo numbers in their opt-in flows** and **campaigns.**<br>- Brands cannot submit using HighLevel's **sample number provided in guidance.**<br>_eg: "Additionally end users can also text START to +1 (213) 725-2867."_ |

```
⚠️ IMPORTANT: The ecosystem constantly improves the vetting criteria as it comes across additional violations.

1. Following the best practices listed above DOES NOT guarantee approval.

2. Best practices above illustrate the general direction of compliant, high-quality messaging that the ecosystem is moving towards.
```

## **Opt-In Methods**

Campaigns require a proper opt-in method which ensures that end-users provide consent to receive text messages. Verbal opt-in is the most difficult method to verify however, is acceptable as long enough details are provided that a 3rd party reviewer can verify.

### **1\. Verbal Opt-In**

Below is an example of a verbal opt-in, which would happen during a phone call with the consumer. You can also get a verbal opt-in by using a phone IVR flow, which would consist of an automated system getting opt-in confirmation from the consumer.

- **Phone IVR:** "As part of our service we can send you automated monthly text alerts regarding account payment activity. We will send two messages per month. Message and data rates may apply, depending on your mobile phone service plan. At any time you can get more help by replying HELP to these texts, or you can opt-out completely by replying STOP. Mobile Terms of Service are available at http://ghl.com/terms and our Privacy Statement can be found at https://ghl.com/privacy. Please reply with 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you would like this service".



**Customer:** "Yes please"



**Phone IVR:** "Great! We will send you a text message to confirm your enrollment here shortly."

### **2\. Web Form Opt-In**

An embedded form on the end business’s website prompts end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.

#### **⚠️ Important Requirements for Web Form Opt-In:**

1. Opt-in checkbox **MUST** be selectable by end-user

2. Opt-in checkbox **MUST** include a disclaimer (consent message) such as:
   - _"I consent to receive sms notifications, alert from COMPANY NAME HERE. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP to (XXX) XXX-XXX for assistance. You can reply STOP to unsubscribe at any time."_
3. Opt-in consent message and checkbox **MUST** be separated from **Privacy Policy \| Terms of Service** and **Promotional** consent checkboxes. Promotional consent may be something like the following:
   - _"By checking this box I agree to receive occasional marketing messages from INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE."_
4. Opt-in disclaimer **MUST** have All CTA (Call to Action) disclosures present to be considered compliant:




   - Program name and/or a description of the messages that will be sent (appointment reminders, marketing messages, occasional offers, etc.)

   - The organization or individual being represented in the initial message

   - Fee disclosure (“Message and data rates may apply”)

   - Service delivery frequency or recurring messages disclosure (“4 messages per month”, “Message frequency varies”, “1 message per login”, etc

   - Customer care information (typically “Text HELP for help” or Help at XXX-XXX-XXXX) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)

   - Opt out instructions (typically “Text STOP to unsubscribe”) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)

   - Link to Privacy Policy describing how end user opt-in information will be used. Be sure there is no mention of sharing of personal information with Third Parties (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)

   - Link to Terms and Conditions describing terms of service (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)

   - Incorporate a checkbox option that end-users must select in order to receive SMS messaging. **The checkbox can not be pre-selected.** The checkbox provides the end-user the ability to agree, or not agree, to receive SMS messaging.

**Below are examples of Web form Opt-In flow.**

When **Phone Number** field is **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

- Consent checkboxes should be separated for both Marketing and Non-Marketing Messages.
- Consent **checkboxes cannot be pre-selected** and **should be optional** when **Phone Number is required.**
- SMS notifications cannot be forced in the form. Meaning **you cannot require BOTH consent and the phone number to proceed.**
- **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

When **Phone Number** field not **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

- Consent checkbox not required when Phone Number field is not mandatory.
- **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

```
PLEASE NOTE:

If the web opt-in is behind a login or not yet published, host a screen shot on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the image URL and the website URL in your registration form where it asks: "How do end-users consent to receive messages?"

To get a useable image link, you can upload the screenshot to your Media Storage Library in your HighLevel sub-account as shown in the screenshot below:
```

### **3\. Paper Form Opt-In**

An in-store visitor completes a physical form that collects their phone number and their consent to subscribe to your texting campaign.

Host a screenshot of the paper form on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?".

### **4\. Text Message Opt-In**

Host a screen shot of the campaign collateral on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?" along with the website URL.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042885362/original/LK9mev9XVpw1mn8m7SVp1ZcKOBbSakBB6Q.png?1741397006)

### **5\. Mobile QR Code Opt-In**

You can also use a QR code that links to an online form prompting end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.

QR codes can direct the consumer to the messaging application used on their mobile device (for example iMessage) with a templated opt-in message, or can even take the consumer directly to a web-form opt-in on your website.

```
PLEASE NOTE: If the QR code leads to a Web-Form Opt-In, please follow all requirements listed in this article above where we discuss the Web-Form Opt-In method.
```

# **Double Opt-In in A2P 10DLC**

Double Opt-In (DOI) is a compliance practice in A2P 10DLC messaging where users must confirm their consent twice before receiving SMS communications from a business. It enhances compliance with carrier and regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of spam complaints and improving message deliverability.

#### **How Double Opt-In Works**

#### **1\. Initial Sign-Up (First Opt-In)**

- A user expresses interest in receiving SMS messages by submitting their phone number via a web form, text message, mobile app, or another method.
- **Example:** A customer texts "JOIN" to a 10DLC number.


#### **2\. Confirmation Request (Second Opt-In)**

- The business sends an SMS asking the user to confirm their subscription, typically by replying with a keyword like "YES."
- **Example:** You requested to receive messages from \[Brand Name\]. Reply YES to confirm. Msg & data rates may apply.

#### **3\. Final Confirmation**

- Once the user replies with “ **YES**,” they are officially subscribed and can receive further marketing or transactional messages.

#### **Why Double Opt-In is Important in A2P 10DLC**

- #### Reduced Spam Complaints: Prevents accidental or fraudulent sign-ups, reducing the risk of messages being marked as spam.

- Higher Deliverability: Carriers are more likely to allow traffic from numbers that follow proper opt-in procedures.
- Improved Customer Trust: Users who confirm twice are more engaged and less likely to opt out later.

# **Campaign registration recommendations**

**Campaign registrations should meet each of the following descriptions for each field.**

## **Campaign Type**

**Please choose the use case that best represents your campaign. For more information, please refer to the details provided [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000235-list-of-campaign-use-case-types-for-a2p-10dlc-registration).**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| **_2FA use case is selected for any authentication or account verification such as OTP._** | **Higher Education is selected for any authentication or account verification such as OTP.**<br>**Why is this rejected?** **Use case would not match intended use, campaign will be rejected.** |

## **Campaign Description**

**The description should be thorough and explain the campaign’s objective or purpose. Provided description needs to answer who the sender is, who the recipient is, and why messages are being sent to the intended recipient.**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| **_“Messages are sent by Acme to its existing customers. OTP Messages for MFA challenges for logging into the online portal to make changes to a user profile for security purposes._**<br>**_Customers confirm with an SMS when profile changes are made.”_** | _“Blank”_<br>**Why is this rejected?** No information is provided for the campaign's purpose.<br>_“This campaign sends messages to customers”_<br>**Why is this rejected?** It does not provide information on who is sending and receiving messages and why messages are being sent. |

## ****How do end-users consent to receive messages?****

**The answer should contain the following information:**

1. **The program or product description**

2. **Telephone number(s) from which messaging will originate**

3. **Identify of the organization or individual being represented in the initial message**

4. **Clear and conspicuous language about opt-in and any associated fees or charges**

5. **Compliant Privacy Policy**

6. **Other applicable terms and conditions (e.g., how to opt-out, customer care contact information)**


**Opt-in needs to apply per campaign, should be not transferable or assignable and can not be obscured in terms and conditions (especially terms related to other services). If multiple opt-in methods can be used for the same campaign, please list them all.**

**A compliant Privacy Policy must state that no mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. Information sharing to subcontractors in support services, such as customer service is permitted. All other use case categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.**

**Campaign reviewers need to be able to verify details provided in this field. Provide evidence such as a hosted link to screenshot or document for opt-in that occurs behind a gated login or on a paper form.**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| _**Message Flow:**_ **_“Customers provide opt-in specifically when enrolling into our website, or in person by requesting SMS capabilities within the store. Opt-in during website is a self-service process and occurs at acme.com/signup”_** _**Website Opt-in Language:**_ **_“By submitting, you authorize ACME to send text messages with offers and other information. Message/data rates apply. Consent is not a condition of purchase. \[Link to terms and conditions\]._”** | **“Customers sign up”**<br>**Why is this rejected?** **Where and how the customer provides opt-in is unclear.** |

## **Sample message**

**Sample messages should reflect actual messages to be sent under the campaign and indicate templated fields with brackets. Ensure consistency with use case and campaign description.**

**Sample messages should identify who is sending the message (brand name). Ensure that at least one sample message includes your business name.**

**Include opt-out language to at least 1 sample message.**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| **_“ACME 2FA Notice:Here is your one time password: 1234_**<br>**_Call \[phone-number\] to report if this request was not made by you.”_** | **“You have an upcoming appointment”**<br>**Why is this rejected?** **Opt-out is not provided, campaign will be rejected.** |

## **Opt-in Keywords**

**Please provide all keywords that allow users to opt-in to receive campaign messages.**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| **_“START,_** _**OPTIN, UNSTOP,** **IN”**_ | **"“Blank”**<br>**Why is this rejected?** **Message flow indicates customers can opt-in through text but no opt-in keywords are provided, campaign will be rejected** |

**Opt-in Confirmation Message**

**Campaign must provide customers with an opt-in confirmation message. This is required for all recurring campaigns, regardless of opt-in method,** [CTIA Messaging Principles and Best Practices](https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/230523-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf).

5. **Message frequency (must align with the frequency on the CTA and SMS Terms)**

6. **A “Message and data rates may apply” disclosure**

| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| ****_“You are successfully opted in for messages from ACME for account notifications. Message and data rates may apply. Reply Help for additional support. Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”_****<br>****_\[Company name\]: Thank you for signing up for updates! Msg freq varies. Msg&Data rates may apply. Reply HELP for help, STOP to cancel._**** | ****_“You opted in for messages”_****<br>**Why is this rejected?** ****Opt-in message does not contain any information on brand and no information on opt-out process, campaign will be rejected.**** |

## **Opt-out Keywords**

****Please provide all keywords that allow end users to stop receiving messaging from this campaign.****

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Successful Example** | **Failed Example** |
| ****_“STOP,_**** _****UNSUBSCRIBE,****_<br>_****END,**** ****QUIT, CANCEL, STOP ALL****_ ****_”_**** | ****“Blank”****<br>**Why is this rejected?** ****default Opt-out handling is disabled.

## **Opt-out Confirmation Message**

****When end users send opt-out keywords, the response messages need to include acknowledgement of opt-out request, brand name, and confirmation that no further messages will be sent.****

|     |     |
| --- | --- |

## **Campaign Failure/Rejection Reasons**

You can now view rejection reasons directly in the UI. Once you are in the Trust center tab, click on "Failed" to review the Campaign Failure Reason. All failed/rejected campaigns will now display their specific failure reasons.

```
PLEASE NOTE: TCR (The Campaign Registry) often rejects a campaign based on the first issue they encounter, potentially overlooking other issues. Do not focus solely on the rejection reason and instruct the client on how to resolve it, as they might correct that issue, resubmit, and face rejection again for a different reason. Instead, review the entire campaign submission and the client’s website to ensure everything is correct and compliant.
```

### **Failure/Rejection Reason \#1:** Message Flow

- The campaign submission has been reviewed and it was rejected because of provided Opt-in information.

**Approved example:**

- End users opt-in by visiting - https://brandname.com/contact\_us and filling in their details on the survey Users check a box to receive messages from us to provide their consent at the end of the survey: _[https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/xxxxxxxxx.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/xxxxxxxxx.png)_
