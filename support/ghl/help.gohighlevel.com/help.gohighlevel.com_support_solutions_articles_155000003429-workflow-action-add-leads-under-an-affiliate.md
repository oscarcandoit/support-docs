# **How to Configure the Workflow Action**

Setting up the **Add Leads Under an Affiliate** workflow action allows you to assign leads to affiliates in your campaigns automatically or manually, depending on how your leads are captured.

The following steps walk you through setting up the workflow trigger, adding the action, choosing a configuration method, and publishing your workflow.

### **Access the Workflow Builder**

Navigate to the **Automation** section in the left-hand menu, then select **Workflows**. From the **Workflow List**, click **Create Workflow** in the upper-right corner.

You can choose to start from a recipe, template, or from scratch, depending on your workflow needs. This step opens the workflow builder, where you can begin setting up the structure of your automation.

### **Add a Workflow Trigger**

Before adding the affiliate action, ensure your workflow has a **trigger**—this determines when a lead will be added under an affiliate.

Without a trigger, no leads will enter the workflow, and the action will not execute.

Common triggers include:

- **Form Submitted:** When a contact completes a specific form.

- **Tag Added:** When a tag is applied to a contact.


### **Add the Workflow Action**

After setting up your trigger, add the **Add Leads Under an Affiliate** action to the workflow.

Click the **\+ Add** button, then select **Add Action** from the dropdown menu.

This opens the list of available workflow actions where you can choose the appropriate one for your automation setup. This step adds a new action block that will handle your affiliate lead assignment.

### **Select the Action Type**

Once the action menu opens, scroll to the **Affiliate** section under **Actions** and select **Add Leads Under an Affiliate**.

This connects your workflow to the Affiliate Manager system, enabling leads to be added under a specific affiliate campaign and affiliate.

After selecting this action, it appears in your workflow builder, ready for configuration.

### **Choose Manual Assignment**

Choose **Manual Assignment** when you want to directly assign a lead to a specific affiliate and campaign.

This is ideal for fixed lead routing, internal workflows, or cases where affiliate assignments are predetermined.

In this configuration:

- Select **Manual** under Choose Action Mapping.
- Pick an affiliate **Campaign** from the dropdown list.
- Once a campaign is chosen, the system displays affiliates linked to that campaign.
- Select the desired **Affiliate** from the list.
- Save the configuration.

This ensures all new leads entering this workflow are automatically assigned to the chosen affiliate.

### **Configure Auto-Track via Attribution**

The **Auto-Track Affiliate via Attribution** method automatically assigns leads to affiliates based on tracking links containing an affiliate ID (am\_id).

This is best for automated setups where affiliate links are used to drive traffic.

Here’s how it works:

- Select **Auto-Track Affiliate via Attribution** under _Choose Action Mapping._

- Choose the **Attribution Source**:

  - **First Attribution:** Credits the first affiliate who referred the contact.

  - **Latest Attribution:** Credits the most recent affiliate interaction.
- Save your configuration.


When leads arrive through affiliate URLs (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/?am\_id=1234), HighLevel captures that ID and automatically credits the correct affiliate.

### **Configure Custom Mapping**

Use **Custom Mapping** to dynamically assign affiliates using data stored in custom fields or workflow variables.

This method is ideal for API integrations or external systems where affiliate data is passed dynamically rather than through tracking links.

To configure:

- Choose **Custom Mapping** under _Choose Action Mapping._

- Enter the mapping source:

  - Use a **custom field** (e.g., {{contact.custom\_field.am\_id}})

  - Or a **workflow variable** (e.g., {{workflow.am\_id}})
- The system matches the affiliate ID to the correct affiliate record and assigns the lead automatically.


This setup gives you maximum flexibility for advanced routing or integrated affiliate data flows.

### **Test and Publish Your Workflow**

Before activating, test your setup to ensure that affiliates are being assigned correctly. Testing confirms that your triggers, campaign selection, mapping logic, and attribution all function as intended.

Steps to finalize:

1. Click **Test Workflow** in the top-right corner to simulate lead entry.

2. Review the **Execution Logs** to verify successful affiliate assignment.

3. Once confirmed, toggle from **Draft** to **Publish** to activate your workflow.


Your workflow is now live and ready to automatically assign leads to affiliates using your chosen configuration method.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:****What happens if no matching affiliate is found for an am\_id?**

The workflow will complete without assigning the lead. Verify that the am\_id corresponds to an existing affiliate in your campaign.

**Q:** **Can I manually override an automatically assigned affiliate?**

Yes. You can manually reassign affiliates from within the Affiliate Manager if a correction is needed.

**Q: Does this action require a sale or reward to work?**

No. You can assign a lead under an affiliate even if no reward or dollar amount is involved. Rewards or commissions are only applied when a qualifying purchase or conversion is made through the affiliate’s link.

**Q:** **How is “First Attribution” different from “Latest Attribution”?**

“First Attribution” credits the initial referrer, while “Latest Attribution” credits the most recent one before conversion.

**Q:** **Can I assign multiple affiliates to one lead?**

No. A lead can be assigned to only one affiliate per campaign to maintain accurate tracking.

**Q:** **How can I test this workflow before activating it?**

Use the **Test Workflow** feature with sample data to ensure correct assignment before publishing.
