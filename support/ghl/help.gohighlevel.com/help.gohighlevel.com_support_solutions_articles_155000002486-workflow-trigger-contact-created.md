# **What is the "Contact Created" Workflow Trigger?**

The Contact Created trigger activates a workflow whenever a new contact is added to the CRM. This ensures that businesses can automate follow-ups, engage new leads instantly, and streamline contact management. The trigger works regardless of how the contact is created—manually, via form submissions, or through integrations—making it a powerful tool for automation.

## **Key Benefits of the "Contact Created" Trigger**

## **Configuring the "Contact Created" Workflow Trigger**

Setting up the ‘Contact Created’ Workflow Trigger’ ensures that your automation runs exactly when needed. Before adding actions, it’s important to configure the trigger properly to filter contacts and define when the workflow should activate. The following steps will guide you through the setup process.

### **Create a New Workflow**

Navigate to **Automations**. Click + Create Workflow and select Start from Scratch or edit an existing workflow.

### **Naming the Trigger**

Name the trigger for easy identification (e.g., "New Contact Welcome Sequence").

### **Applying Filters**

Filters help refine when the workflow should trigger, ensuring that only relevant contacts activate the automation. This allows businesses to control who enters the workflow, preventing unnecessary actions on all new contacts. Below are the available filter options and how they can be used:

- **Has Tag:** This filter allows you to trigger the workflow only for contacts that have a specific tag assigned to them. For example, if you want to activate the workflow only for "New Leads" or "VIP Clients," you can set this filter to include only those contacts with the appropriate tag.
- **Custom Fields:** If your CRM includes custom fields such as "Industry Type," "Lead Score," or "Customer Category," you can use this filter to trigger the workflow only when certain criteria are met. This is useful when segmenting leads based on business type, engagement level, or other personalized attributes.
- **Created via Source:** This filter helps differentiate contacts based on how they were added to the system. You can specify whether the workflow should trigger only for contacts that were manually added, submitted through a form, or imported via API. This prevents automation from triggering for contacts that do not require immediate action, such as bulk imports.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Will this trigger activate for contacts imported in bulk?**

No, the Contact Created trigger only activates when a contact is manually added, submitted through a form, created via API, or added through an integration. Bulk imports do not trigger this workflow to prevent accidental automation overload. If you need to automate actions for imported contacts, consider using a separate workflow with manual enrollment.

**Q. Can I set conditions to trigger this workflow only for specific contacts?**

Yes, you can apply filters to ensure the workflow only runs for specific contacts. Filters allow you to target contacts based on tags, custom fields, or sources. For example, you can configure the workflow to activate only when a contact is tagged as “New Lead” or when their source is “Web Form Submission.” This ensures that only relevant contacts trigger the workflow, preventing unnecessary automation.

**Q. What happens if a contact is added multiple times? Will the workflow trigger again?**

If a contact with the same email or phone number is added again, the system may recognize it as an existing contact, depending on the CRM’s duplicate detection settings. If the contact is merged with an existing record, the workflow will not trigger again. However, if the system treats it as a brand-new contact, the workflow will execute as expected.

**Q. Can I use this trigger to automatically assign new contacts to team members?**

Yes, you can configure the workflow to assign new contacts to a sales representative or team member based on specific criteria. This can be done using filters such as location, tags, or lead source. You can also implement a round-robin assignment to distribute leads evenly among your team.

**Q. How can I track the effectiveness of this workflow?**

You can monitor workflow execution logs to see how often the trigger fires and which contacts are processed. For email-based actions, tracking metrics such as open rates and response rates will provide insights into engagement. If the workflow assigns contacts to sales reps, reviewing follow-up completion rates can help assess its impact. Regularly analyzing workflow performance will help optimize automation for better efficiency.
