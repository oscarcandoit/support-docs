# Uploading audio inside Course lessons

Modified on: Mon, 23 Sep, 2024 at 12:36 PM

### **New Feature: Audio Files in Courses**

You can now add **audio lessons** directly into your courses. This feature allows for greater flexibility in how course creators present their content and how learners engage with it.

### **How to add audio lessons in your courses**

#### **1\. Uploading an audio**

- You can now upload audio files to your course lessons with just one click. The integration of audio files creates flexibility in content delivery, allowing course creators to offer audio-based lessons.
- Head to Memberships > Courses > Lessons > Choose audio as an option to add in a lesson.
- You can choose audio alone as a lesson or combine it with text content.
- **After uploading the audio, publish the lesson to make it available to your students.**

#### 2\. **Support for Multiple Audio Formats**

Our system supports a wide variety of audio file types to ensure compatibility across devices. You can upload and manage audio files in formats such as:

- MP3
- AAC
- WAV

**The audio content you upload is fully optimized for a variety of devices, including:**

- **Desktops**
- **Tablets**
- **Mobile phones**

This ensures that learners can access audio lessons from any device, making your courses even more accessible.

#### 4\. **Automatic Audio Thumbnails**

Thumbnails for your audio lessons will automatically be taken from the **lesson thumbnails**. This maintains consistency in branding and presentation across all course content.

#### 5\. **Customizable Playback Options for Learners**

Learners will have more control over how they engage with the audio content:

- Adjust playback speed
- Configure playback speed
