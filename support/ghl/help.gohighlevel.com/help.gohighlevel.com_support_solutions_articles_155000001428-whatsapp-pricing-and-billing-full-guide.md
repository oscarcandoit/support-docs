# **Overview of WhatsApp Billing**

WhatsApp in HighLevel now uses a **per-message pricing model**, charging businesses for each **delivered message** rather than a flat fee per 24-hour conversation window. This shift offers greater transparency and control over messaging costs, enabling more precise budgeting and strategy.

Messages are categorized into **Marketing**, **Utility**, **Authentication**, and **Service** types — each with its own pricing logic and strategic use cases. Understanding these message types and how they're triggered is essential for optimizing spend and delivering timely, relevant communication to your customers.

By aligning your outreach with these categories, you can take full advantage of cost-saving opportunities (like free utility messages within an open customer service window) while maintaining high-quality engagement.

## **Key Benefits of WhatsApp's Pricing Structure**

With WhatsApp transitioning to a **per-message pricing model**, businesses gain greater control, flexibility, and transparency in how they communicate with customers. Understanding these benefits allows agencies and businesses to align their messaging strategy with both operational goals and cost-efficiency.

- **Transparent, Granular Billing:** Messages are individually categorized into **Marketing**, **Utility**, and **Service** types. This granularity allows businesses to:




  - Clearly understand what they’re being charged for.

  - Design messaging strategies around specific goals—such as promotions, alerts, or customer support—without hidden costs.
- **Optimized Rebilling for Agenci** **es:** Per-message billing simplifies client rebilling:




  - Agencies can offer tailored pricing models based on actual usage.

  - This enables transparent invoicing and unlocks new monetization opportunities by mapping charges directly to client campaigns.
- **Smarter Cost Control via Customer Service Windows:** WhatsApp continues to support 24-hour customer service windows:




  - Utility messages sent within this window are free, encouraging prompt, customer-initiated engagement.

  - This reduces the cost of ongoing support while maintaining high responsiveness.

- **Cost-Efficient Entry Points:** Though the pricing is per-message, free entry point messages (e.g. via call-to-action buttons or ads) still help reduce acquisition costs by initiating customer conversations without an immediate charge.

* * *

## **WhatsApp Subscription Charges for Agencies**

Understanding the subscription charges is essential for agencies and locations to plan their WhatsApp usage and billing effectively. Below are the key details:

- **Agency Charge**: If you or your customer chooses to use WhatsApp messaging, each sub-account that uses WhatsApp incurs a monthly subscription charge of **$10 USD** that is charged to the agency.

- **Rebilling Opportunity**: Agencies can rebill clients at a customized rate. By default, this rate is set at **$29.99**, creating a profit margin of **$19.99 per location per month**.

* * *

## **WhatsApp Messaging Rates**

Understanding WhatsApp's messaging rates is critical for managing costs effectively. Rates vary based on the **template category** (Marketing, Utility, Service) and the **country/region** where the message is sent.

1. **Payment Processing Fees**: A 5% Stripe fee is added to these rates, which should be considered when setting up rebilling.

2. **Regional Variations**: Rates differ significantly by region, so plan campaigns with regional costs in mind.

```
Rate Application Example
Assume a Marketing message is sent to the U.S.
Base rate: $0.0263
Multiplier: 1.5X
Final cost to the client: $0.0263 × 1.5 = $0.0395
```

* * *

## **WhatsApp Message-Based Pricing \[Effective 1 July 2025\]**

Starting July 1, 2025, WhatsApp will adopt a **message-based pricing model** that charges businesses for each **delivered message**, rather than per conversation. This shift provides more transparent cost alignment with how businesses engage with users and encourages efficient, purposeful messaging.

Understanding the types of messages and when they are charged is key to managing communication costs and optimizing engagement. Below are the primary **message categories** under the new pricing model:

### **1\. Marketing Messages**

- **Definition:** Outbound promotional messages sent to users, such as product offers, announcements, and re-engagement campaigns.

- **Pricing:** Charged **per delivered message**, regardless of customer service window status.

- **Use Case Examples:** Sales promotions, event invitations, abandoned cart reminders.


### **2\. Utility Messages**

- **Definition:** Transactional messages that relate to a specific, agreed-upon transaction or update.

- **Pricing:**

  - **Charged per message** when sent **outside** an open customer service window.

  - **Free** if delivered **within** an active 24-hour customer service window initiated by the user.
- **Use Case Examples:** Order confirmations, shipping updates, appointment reminders.


#### **How It Works:**

We charge for each template message a business sends to a user. For example, if a business sends 1 marketing message and 1 utility mess, that incurs 1 charge for each category.

#### **What This Mean:**

Pricing on WhatsApp Business Platform is consistent with alternate channels, which also charge for each message.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048393977/original/1TxoZGCP67Hkk4uxCogxqpH4NzjWFB9HaQ.png?1750160454)

```
IMPORTANT: Each category has specific initiation methods.

Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations can ONLY be opened with template messages.

Service conversations can ONLY be opened with free-form messages.

To learn how to choose an appropriate category when creating your Whatsapp templates, see Template Categorization Guidelines.
```

#### **Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations**

These conversations remain open for 24 hours from the time the first template message is delivered unless closed by a newly opened free-entry point conversation.

- **Marketing Conversations:** Used for promotional messages, product or service announcements, retargeting campaigns, and cart abandonment reminders.

- **Utility Conversations:** Used to provide information requested by users, such as order updates, delivery notifications, and payment reminders.

- **Authentication Conversations:** Used to authenticate users via one-time passcodes for processes like account verification and recovery.

## **Service Conversations \[Effective 1 November 2024\]**

This 24-hour timer begins when a customer messages you. During this window, free-form messages can be sent without opening additional conversations.

- Used to resolve customer inquiries and issues.

- Service conversations are initiated when a free-form message is delivered to a customer, provided no other conversation of any type is open.

- These conversations rely on an active customer service window between you and the customer.

#### **How It Works:**

Businesses can respond via free-form messages to users within the 24 hours customer service window at no charge. The 24 hour customer service window resets with each message.

#### **What This Mean:**

Businesses can be available for and engage with their customers on WhatsApp, including via AI-enabled conversational experiences, at no charge.

```
The customer service window is a 24 our timer that starts with a user message and resets with each message. As long as the customer service window is open, businesses can respond to users via free-form messages or utility messages at no charge.

Free-form messages are any message type that is not a template.
```

#### **Example 1: Per Message Based Pricing**

We charge for each template message a business sends to a user. For example, if a business sends 1 marketing message and 1 utility mess, that incurs 1 charge for each category.

#### **Example 2: Free- Form and Utility Messages**

Businesses can respond to users at no charge with free form and utility message templates. When the customer service window is open, businesses can also send utility messages at no charge.

## **Free Entry Point Conversations** **\[Effective 1 June 2023\]**

Free entry point conversations provide cost-saving opportunities for businesses by allowing free communication for a limited duration.

- **How It’s Triggered**: A customer messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad or Facebook Page Call-to-Action button, and you respond to the message within 24 hours.

- **Duration**: These conversations last 72 hours and automatically close all other open conversations.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Once initiated, no additional charges are incurred for any type of message sent within the 72-hour window.

#### **How It Works:**

When a user messages a business from an ad that clicks to WhatsAp or a Facebook Page Action button, and the business responds within 24 hours, that response opens a 72 hour 'free entry point' window where template messages are not charged.

#### **What This Mean:**

Businesses can use these entry points to get more value when messaging users on WhatsApp.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048395887/original/3dVNid2dzs_GOS_P3asL9flAmAr4iyNmnw.png?1750161319)

```
Example of Free Entry Point Conversation

If a customer messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad at 10 am and you respond at 10 pm the same day:
The free entry point conversation starts at 10 pm and lasts for 72 hours.
```

* * *

## **WhatsApp Messaging Rates by Market/Country \[Effective 1 October 2025\]**

Understanding conversation rates by market or country helps businesses plan their communication costs effectively. Rates vary depending on the type of conversation (Marketing, Utility, or Service) and the region where the message is sent. This information allows for precise budgeting and optimized communication strategies tailored to specific geographic locations.

## **Rebilling WhatsApp Messages**

Rebilling offers agencies flexibility in setting WhatsApp messaging pricing for clients, creating additional revenue opportunities. Here’s how it works:

1. **Base Rates**: Agencies pay base rates for each conversation category (e.g., Marketing, Utility, Authentication, or Service).

2. **Pricing Multiplier**: Agencies can apply a multiplier to the base rates to determine the pricing for their clients.



_For example:_
   - Base rate for a Marketing message in the US: **$0.0263**.

   - Multiplier set to **1.5X**: Client is charged **$0.0395** per message.
3. **Default Multiplier**: The default multiplier is set at **1.05X** to cover payment processing fees.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040536184/original/-KAyIRrTqLCTNrpXEihCEn8u1tSeQITYcg.jpeg?1738002508)

### **Your Client's WhatsApp Subscription**

When **YOUR** client purchases WhatsApp services from you, two subscriptions are created:

1. Between the client’s card and your Stripe account for client payments.

2. Between HighLevel and your Stripe account to pay HighLevel the $10/month/location subscription fee.


**Message Costs**: Outbound template messages are billed based on the [Market/Country](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001428-whatsapp-pricing-and-billing-full-guide#WhatsApp-Messaging-Rates-by-Market/Country) and [Conversation Category](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001428-whatsapp-pricing-and-billing-full-guide#WhatsApp-Conversation-Based-Pricing).
