## **What is Custom Font Support in Funnels & Websites?**

Custom Font Support is a native HighLevel feature that allows you to upload, store, and apply your own font files directly inside the Funnels and Websites Builder. By removing the need for external font hosting or @font-face code, the feature gives designers and agencies full control over brand typography while streamlining page creation.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Custom Font Support in Funnels & Websites**

- **Brand Consistency:** Maintain identical typography across every funnel and webpage for a unified customer experience.

- **No CSS Required:** Apply custom fonts entirely through the builder—saving time and avoiding code errors.

- **Faster Workflow:** Upload once, then select your font from the dropdown in any text element.

- **Flexible File Support:** Use industry-standard formats and treat each style (e.g., Bold, Italic) as its own pick-list option for precise styling.


* * *

## **Custom Fonts Modal**

The Custom Fonts Modal centralizes font management so you can add or update typefaces in seconds.

- Access the modal by clicking **Upload Fonts** within any font dropdown.

- Drag-and-drop or browse to select files from your device.

- Review existing uploads and remove outdated versions with one click.

## **Supported Font Formats**

HighLevel accepts the most common font standards, ensuring compatibility with professional type libraries.

- `.ttf` – TrueType Font

- `.otf` – OpenType Font

- `.woff` – Web Open Font Format

## **Media Storage Integration**

Store fonts securely in HighLevel so your team can reuse them across accounts and projects.

- Uploaded fonts are automatically saved to **Media Storage** for easy access.

- Delete or rename fonts from Media Storage without breaking live pages—as long as the file name remains unchanged.
