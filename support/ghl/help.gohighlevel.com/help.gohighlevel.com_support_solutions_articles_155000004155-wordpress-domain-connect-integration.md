We’re excited to announce an update to Domain Connect that makes managing domains easier than ever! With this new version, you can save time and skip complicated steps.

**What’s New?**

**Supports Major Domain Providers:** Now, Domain Connect works with GoDaddy, Cloudflare, and IONOS. You can easily use these new features if your domain is with any of these providers.

**Quick Domain Setup:** Linking your domain from GoDaddy, Cloudflare, or IONOS is now super easy. Just a few clicks, and you’re done — no technical skills needed!

**No More Manual Setup:** Forget about adjusting DNS settings by hand. With Domain Connect, everything is set up automatically, so you don’t have to worry about the details.

**Saves You Time:** Domain Connect takes care of everything, making domain setup fast and easy. This means you can focus on managing your website instead of dealing with the setup.

**How It Works**

**1\.    Go to the Dashboard:**

Log into HighLevel and go to the WordPress hosting section.
