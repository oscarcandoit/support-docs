| **Total** | Total number of WhatsApp messages triggered through this action for the selected date range. |
| **Pending** | Messages that are queued but have not yet been triggered. |
| **Sent** | Messages that have been sent to WhatsApp but are awaiting delivery. Represented by a **single tick** in WhatsApp. |
| **Delivered** | Messages successfully delivered to the recipient’s device. Represented by **double ticks**. Includes users who have disabled read receipts. |
| **Read** | Messages that have been opened/read by the recipient. Represented by **blue ticks**. |
| **Failed** | Messages that could not be delivered due to various reasons such as: non-WhatsApp number, blacklisted template, blocked account, or marketing template limits or [Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates#per-user-marketing-template-message-limits) |

Messages to recipients with read receipts turned off will appear under the Delivered status, even if they were read.
