# How to Resolve the "ZIP Code Check Failed for Your Card" Banner

Modified on: Fri, 28 Feb, 2025 at 8:57 AM

### **Why This Error Appears ?**

When adding a payment method, Highlevel validates the ZIP code via our payment service provider. This validation is performed at the provider’s discretion and serves as an added security measure to prevent stolen card attacks. If the ZIP code entered does not match the one associated with your card, this error will appear.

### **Steps to Update the ZIP Code and Resolve the Issue**

To fix this issue, please ensure that the ZIP code entered in your default payment method matches the ZIP code on your bank statement. Follow these steps to update your payment information:

1. **Go to the Billing Page:** Navigate to your account’s billing section.

2. **Click on the Payment Tab:** Select the payment tab and click on the edit icon for the payment method.

3. **Add a New Card:** Click on "Add New Card."

4. **Enter Your Card Information:** Input your existing card number and the correct ZIP code that matches the one on your bank statement.

**Note:** If the card number remains the same except for the ZIP code, it will replace your existing card.

```
Please note :- The ZIP code that needs to be updated is the one associated with the card details, not the billing address ZIP code.
```

### **What to Do If the Issue Persists**

If you have entered the correct ZIP code and the error still appears, please take the following steps:

1. **Raise a Support Ticket:** Contact our support team for further assistance.

2. **Provide a Bank Statement Snippet:** We may require a document showing the last four digits of your card and the associated ZIP code.

**Note:** You do not need to share your full bank statement—just a snippet displaying the necessary details.

3. **We will raise the issue with our payment service provider** for further validation and get this resolved.
