# **What is Company-Based Workflows?**

Company-Based Workflows let you automate at the **account level** by targeting the **Company** object—rather than a single Contact. This enables onboarding, lifecycle updates, data hygiene, and reporting alignment for B2B accounts with multiple stakeholders, all from one centralized automation.

Company-Based Workflows are a workflow type in HighLevel that starts from Company events (for example, when a Company is created or updated) and runs actions that write directly to Company fields or to **Contacts associated with that Company**. This bridges the gap between contact-level and account-level automation, unlocking true B2B use cases in HighLevel.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Company-Based Workflows**

Focusing automation at the Company level improves data consistency and operational efficiency across teams. The benefits below frame the **business outcomes** customers can expect, with examples for real-world implementation.

- **B2B onboarding**: Launch account-level onboarding the moment a Company is created.

- **Data sync**: Keep Company and associated Contact data aligned to reduce manual updates.

- **CRM hygiene**: Clear outdated Company fields on status changes to maintain clean reports.

- **Ownership consistency**: Standardize Account Owner assignment for all related Contacts.

- **Works with Contact workflows**: Combine Company and Contact workflows to design end-to-end automation.


* * *

## **Company Workflow Triggers & Actions**

Use this matrix to plan **when** a Company-based workflow should start and **what** it should do. Triggers define the starting event on the **Company** object, while actions update Company fields, create/associate records, or optionally impact **associated Contacts**. Filter triggers to narrow scope, and choose actions that align with your data model and safeguards.

### **Company Workflow Triggers**

| Name (UI label) | Starts When | Filters/Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Company Created** | A new Company record is added | Basic filters; segment by owner, tags, fields, or other attributes |
| **Company Changed** | One or more Company fields are updated | Field/value conditions (where available) to react only to specific changes |

### **Company Workflow Actions**

| Name (UI label) | Available In | Primary Purpose | Key Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Create Company or Associated Contact** | Company-based & Contact-based | Create a new Company or add a Contact to an existing Company | Choose create mode; map essential fields |
| **Update Company or Associated Contact** | Company-based & Contact-based | Keep Company data current and optionally sync to associated Contacts | Map fields with static or dynamic values; option to apply to associated Contacts (where available) |
| **Clear Fields of Company or Associated Contact** | Company-based & Contact-based | Remove outdated values to maintain CRM hygiene | Select specific fields to reset |
| **Create Associated Company** | Contact-based only | Create and link a Company from a Contact record | Map Company fields from Contact/context |
| **Update Associated Company** | Contact-based only | Update the Company linked to the current Contact | Map fields; optionally gate with conditions |
| **Clear Fields of Associated Company** | Contact-based only | Reset selected Company fields from a Contact-based workflow | Choose fields to clear |

* * *

## **Typical Use Cases**

Use cases translate features into **repeatable recipes**. Start here to design a first pass, then refine with conditions and branching as your process matures.

- **Onboard new client Companies**: Assign Account Owner, set lifecycle stage, and notify all associated Contacts with a welcome email sequence.

- **Mirror lifecycle stages**: When a Company’s health or status changes, update relevant flags on associated Contacts for success and retention workflows.

- **Data hygiene**: Clear time-bound fields (e.g., promo or temporary discounts) after a set duration.

- **Create Companies from inbound forms**: Build a Company from a B2B lead form and immediately associate the submitting Contact.

- **Push Company attributes to Contacts**: Sync domain, industry, segment, or plan tier to Contacts for segmentation and reporting.

## **How To Set Up Company-Based Workflows**

A clean setup ensures accurate triggers, safe field updates, and predictable outcomes. Build in a test path first, then roll out widely to production Companies.

1. **Create the workflow**



Navigate to **Automation → Workflows → + Create Workflow**.

Choose **Company-based Workflow** as the type.

2. **Add a trigger**



Select **Company Created** or **Company Changed**.

3. **Add actions**



Drag in **Update Company or Associated Contact**, **Create Company or Associated Contact**, or **Clear Fields…** as needed. Map fields using static values or dynamic variables.

Where applicable, choose whether to apply updates to associated Contacts.

4. **Add logic, delays, and branches (optional)**



Use Conditions, If/Else, or Wait steps to control timing and scope.

Keep loops in check—avoid bi-directional “mirror” updates without guardrails.

5. **Save, test, then publish**



**Save** and enroll a small set of Companies to validate mappings.

Review the execution log for successful actions.

**Publish** once validated.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can one workflow update both the Company and its associated Contacts?**

Yes. Use **Update Company or Associated Contact** and select options to apply changes to associated Contacts where available.

**Q: Can I create a Company from a Contact-based workflow?**

Yes. Use **Create Associated Company** in a Contact-based workflow to build and link a Company record.

**Q: How do I avoid update loops between Company and Contact workflows?**

Use conditions (for example, a “last updated by automation” tag/field or a boolean flag) and avoid bi-directional updates without guardrails.

**Q: Can I bulk-enroll existing Companies into a new Company-based workflow?**

Use filters or Smart Lists to enroll a targeted set of Companies, validate on a small batch, then scale up.

**Q: What permissions are required to build and publish these workflows?**

Users need permissions to access **Workflows** and view/update **Companies** and **Contacts** in the sub-account.
