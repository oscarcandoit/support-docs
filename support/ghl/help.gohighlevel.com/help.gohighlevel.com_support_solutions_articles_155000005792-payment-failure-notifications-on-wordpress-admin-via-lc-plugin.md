## **What are Payment Failure Notifications on WordPress Admin?**

Payment Failure Notifications on WordPress Admin is a HighLevel feature that displays clear, contextual alerts in your WordPress Admin dashboard whenever a payment fails. Using the LC Plugin, it delivers real-time prompts that guide you toward resolving billing issues quickly, without leaving your primary work environment.

These alerts appear clearly within the wp-admin interface and guide users to take immediate action, reducing the risk of site disruptions due to unpaid invoices.

## **Key Benefits of Payment Failure Notifications on WordPress Admin**

This feature enhances your WordPress experience by ensuring payment issues are visible and actionable immediately, preventing potential service interruptions.

- **Immediate visibility**: Receive in-dashboard alerts the moment a payment fails.

- The site remains fully accessible during this period.

- After 3 days, a site-lock mechanism activates if the issue persists.

- Encourages action without abrupt service disruption.

## **Dismiss-and-Repeat Logic**

Dismiss-and-Repeat functionality keeps you aware of unresolved issues without overwhelming your workflow. You can hide alerts temporarily, but they return to maintain visibility until resolved.
