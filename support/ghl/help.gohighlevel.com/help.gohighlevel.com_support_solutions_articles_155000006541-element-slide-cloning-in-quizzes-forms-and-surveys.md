# **What is Element & Slide Cloning?**

Element & Slide Cloning lets you instantly duplicate a component you’ve already configured in a form, quiz or survey. With this tool, you can Quickly replicate custom fields, text boxes, image elements, and more. The clone appears directly below the original and preserves its styles, validations, and other settings, so you can reuse proven blocks instead of rebuilding from scratch. After cloning, the new element/slide can be edited without affecting the original. You can also clone entire slides in survey mode, saving time when creating multi-step surveys or repeating question formats.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Element & Slide Cloning**

- **Speed:** One click duplicates any element; slide cloning accelerates multi‑step survey creation.

- **Consistency:** Keep the same spacing, labels, styles, and formatting across repeated sections.

- **Efficiency:** Reuse thoughtfully configured components instead of recreating them.

- **Scalability:** Build larger forms and surveys faster by reusing existing structures.

- **Accuracy:** Preserve validations and required rules to avoid missed settings.

- **Design Reuse:** Copy styled image/text blocks to maintain a uniform look.


* * *

## **What Copies Over on Clone**

Understanding what’s duplicated helps you plan edits after cloning so data collection stays accurate and the UX remains consistent.

- **Styles & Layout:** Fonts, spacing, widths, alignment, and themes.

- **Validations:** Required toggles and validation rules configured on the original element.

- **Content:** Labels, placeholders, choices, and helper text.

- **Images:** Source, alignment, and size settings.

- **Slides (Surveys/Quizzes):** Visual design and layout are copied.

## **Clone Elements in Forms, Surveys & Quizzes**

Elements can be cloned in **Forms, Surveys, and Quizzes** to reuse configured inputs, text, images, and question blocks. Cloning creates an identical copy directly below the original that preserves styling, validations, and content, so you can repeat patterns quickly while keeping a consistent look.

1. Open your **Form**, **Survey**, or **Quiz** in the builder.

2. **Hover** the element you want to duplicate.

3. Click **Clone** (two‑rectangle icon). The duplicate appears immediately **below** the original.

4. Click the cloned element and make any needed updates to the new element.

## **Clone Entire Slides (Surveys & Quizzes)**

Slide cloning duplicates the entire slide canvas—including layout, design blocks, and question elements—so you can build multi‑step flows faster and keep formatting consistent from step to step.

1. Open your **Survey** or **Quiz** in the builder.

2. Move the cursor to the **top‑right** of the slide.

3. Click **Clone Slide**. A full duplicate slide will be created.

4. Make any needed changes to the new slide.
