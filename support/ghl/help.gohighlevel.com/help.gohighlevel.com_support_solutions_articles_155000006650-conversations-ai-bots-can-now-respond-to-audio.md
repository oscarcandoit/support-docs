# **What is Audio Response in Conversations AI?**

Audio Response lets your HighLevel Conversations AI bot “hear” customers. When a contact sends a voice note or audio file, HighLevel transcribes the audio to text, passes it to your bot, and returns an intelligent, context-aware reply so customers can speak naturally without typing.

Conversations AI now supports inbound audio across popular messaging channels. Transcription happens behind the scenes, and the bot follows your existing bot settings (training, prompts, response mode, and timing) for consistent results.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Audio Response**

These advantages focus on customer experience and operator efficiency, tying audio inputs directly into how your bot already works.

- **Natural conversations:** Contacts talk instead of type for a more human experience.

- **Faster resolutions:** Automatic transcription feeds your trained bot to craft accurate replies quickly.

- **Multi-audio intake:** Customers can send one or multiple audio files; your bot processes them as a single interaction.

- **Omnichannel reach:** Works with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and SMS/MMS for one consistent workflow.

- **Consistent governance:** Audio replies respect your Wait Time and message-limit settings, just like text.


* * *

## **Supported Audio Types**

Acceptable formats determine which files the bot can transcribe reliably.

| Category | Supported items | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Voice notes (platform-native)** | WhatsApp Voice Notes, Facebook Voice Notes, Instagram Voice Notes | Recorded using each app’s mic button; delivered to HighLevel as audio objects the bot can transcribe. |
| **File formats (uploads/attachments)** | OGG, MP3, **MP4 (audio-only)**, AAC, M4A, MPEG | Ensure the file is audio-only. Video MP4s aren’t supported as audio inputs. |
| **Multi-audio in one interaction** | **Supported** (multiple files) | Multiple audio files sent close together are handled in a single interaction. |

* * *

## **Channel Compatibility**

Audio Response plugs into channels where Conversations AI already operates. Ensure each channel is properly connected in HighLevel before expecting audio replies.

- **Facebook Messenger**

- **Instagram Direct Messages**

- **WhatsApp**

- **SMS (MMS)**


* * *

## **How To Set Up Audio Response**

Proper setup ensures audio messages are transcribed and handled by the right bot on the right channels.

1. **From your Sub-Account, go to AI Agents → Conversation AI → Agent List, then click the three dots (⋮) next to the bot you want to configure and select Edit to open the bot’s settings.**

2. **Enable Audio Responses**

Toggle **“Also allow this bot to respond to: Voice Notes.”** and Save Your Changes

* * *

## **Behavior & Limitations**

Understanding timing and message handling helps you design the right experience for audio-first customers.

- **Wait Time aggregation:** Your bot waits the configured **Wait Time Before Responding** so it can collect multiple inbound messages (including audio + text) and send **one** unified reply.

- **Message limit:** The bot follows your **Maximum Message Limit**; if reached, the bot sleeps until reset per your standard flow.

- **Transcripts & transparency:** You can review AI details—including prompts, sources, and response info—from the **AI Response Info** sidebar in Conversations.

- **Channel policies:** Delivery on Meta channels must comply with policy windows (e.g., 24-hour window for Messenger/Instagram). Plan flows accordingly.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does Audio Response cost extra?**

Usage is billed under standard **Conversations AI** usage and your channel’s messaging fees (e.g., SMS/MMS, WhatsApp). Agencies can configure rebilling for Conversation AI usage. See **Pricing & Rebilling** and **SMS/MMS costs**; WhatsApp has separate pricing.

**Q: Will the bot reply with audio or text?**

Bots send standard channel messages for maximum compatibility. Most replies are text; design flows accordingly.

**Q: Can I restrict audio handling to specific channels?**

Assign only the channels you want the bot to use in **Bot Settings**. The bot will listen/respond only on assigned channels.

**Q: How are multiple audio files handled?**

Multiple audios in a short window are transcribed and handled during your **Wait Time** window so the bot can craft a single, context-aware reply.

**Q: Where do I review what the bot “saw” and why it responded that way?**

Open the **AI Response Info** sidebar in the conversation to review the response, prompt, and training sources.
