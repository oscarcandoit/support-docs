### **What is Workflow Campaigns?**

Workflow campaigns refer to the combination of all email actions present within a workflow. They allow you to manage and analyze email communications triggered by various workflow steps, offering a comprehensive view of the performance of each email action within a workflow.

To streamline your analysis, we’ve introduced a new way to view statistics for all your email campaigns—whether sent through workflows or as standalone campaigns.

### **Why is This Beneficial?**:

- **Unified Statistics**: Having workflow email stats under **Email Marketing** makes it easier to track and compare campaign performance from one place.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: You can now view both the overall workflow stats and break them down by individual email actions, allowing for deeper analysis of each step in your workflow.
- **Simplified Editing**: You can edit workflows directly from the statistics screen, speeding up the process of making changes and improving efficiency


### **How to Use**:

1. **Navigate to Workflow Campaigns**:

   - Go to **Email Marketing** -\> **Campaigns** -\> **Workflow Campaigns**.
   - This screen will give you access to the overall and individual email statistics.![workflow-campaign-screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034932865/original/rkCijC6vkmuRco_7DwnRGEKb7KWgLaTWxg.jpeg?1729228687)
2. **Edit Workflow**: To make changes, click on **Edit Workflow** to access the workflow builder.![edit-workflow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034932864/original/515zCmCsv2lSRPSHEV3p2BLTlef0g-5_Ug.jpeg?1729228687)

3. **View Statistics**: To see workflow stats, click on **Statistics**. Use the dropdown menu to select and view statistics for individual email actions within the workflow.![individual-email-action](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034932863/original/oFJEP-hGJlEEt02QhVI7_WClfpqBwoxM7g.jpeg?1729228687)

With these improvements, monitoring your email campaigns becomes faster, more insightful, and easier to manage, giving you full control over your email workflows
