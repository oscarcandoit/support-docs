# **What is a Service Calendar?**

Service Calendars are scheduling tools that let you define specific services, assign staff, and allocate resources like rooms and equipment. For a barbershop, this means you can create calendars for services such as haircuts, shaves, and styling—each linked to the right barber, chair, and tools. This ensures customers can book easily while your team avoids scheduling conflicts.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Service Calendars**

Service Calendars help barbershops streamline scheduling, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experience.

- **Automated Scheduling**: Customers book appointments without calling the shop.

- **Resource Management**: Assign chairs and tools (razors, dryers, shears) to prevent double bookings.

- **Staff Scheduling**: Define barbers’ working hours for accurate availability.

- **Service Grouping**: Organize offerings into groups like “Haircuts & Shaves” or “Styling.”

- **Flexible Menus**: Offer multiple services in one booking (e.g., haircut + shave).

- **Professional Branding**: Add images and custom colors for a polished booking page.

* * *

## **Adding Staff Members and Availability**

Adding staff is the foundation of service calendars since no service can be assigned without barbers set up.

### **Click Add User**

From your subaccount dashboard, Navigate to **Settings → My Staff → Add User.**

### **User Info and Permissions**

Enter the barber’s **name, email, extension**. Set **user permissions** (limit access if needed). Define **availability** (e.g., Mark works Mon, Wed, Fri, 9am–5pm; Henry works Tue–Sat, 11am–7pm). Click **Save**.

## **Creating Groups for Barbershop Services**

Groups act as categories to organize services. Each group has its own booking link.

### **Open Calendar Settings**

From the **Calendars** menu, click on **Calendar Settings** at the top-right corner. This is where you access all configuration options for groups, services, and preferences.

### **Enable Service Menu**

Go to **Preferences → Account Preference** and toggle the **Service Menu** option on. This activates the service-based booking system so you can create service calendars and menus.

### **Start Group Creation**

In the **Calendars tab**, click **\+ New Group** on the left sidebar. Groups help you organize related services such as haircuts, shaves, or styling.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054638212/original/EmVLIuXcdxn73QdpNmacY4pcbME-E_N4Gg.png?1758869379)

### **Add Group Details**

Enter the **Group Name, Description, and URL (slug)** in the pop-up form. Select a template type (Classic or Neo) and click **Create** to save the group.

## **Creating Service Calendar**

### **Create Service Calendar**

Select a group from the left sidebar and click **Create Calendar**. This begins the setup of a new service calendar for a specific barbershop service like a haircut or shave.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054638266/original/oXmQxfZWFdZuH-gtlIlBCEIwim6idoUqVw.png?1758869440)

### **Select Service Booking**

Navigate to **Calendars → Service Menu → Create Service Menu**. From the list of calendar types, click **Service Booking**. This option is designed for service-based businesses like barbershops, allowing clients to book specific services such as haircuts or shaves.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054656383/original/oVRAnDtWZ6foUl9MrNK6ZpEmEuOGmsAwXA.png?1758879544)

### **Enter Service Basics**

Fill out the service details including **Service Name, Assigned Staff, Custom URL, Service Duration, and Availability**. This step ensures the calendar is tailored to the specific barbershop service being offered. Click **Advanced Settings** for further customization.

Clicking **Advanced Settings** expands additional configuration panels like **Service Details, Availability, Forms & Payment, Notifications, Customizations, and Rooms & Equipment**. These options let you fine-tune the booking flow, add branding, manage payments, and assign resources such as chairs or tools.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054656460/original/2lYJvgBbPlMvkYZnBq1LAAp_uOHQrW0tUw.png?1758879585)

### **Service Details Setup**

In the **Service Details tab**, you define the information that customers will see when booking this service. Start by uploading a **Service Logo** to give the booking page a professional look. Enter a clear **Service Name** (e.g., Haircut, Beard Trim, Shave) and add a **Description** that explains what the service includes, such as “30-minute haircut with wash and style.”

Next, assign the service to the right **Group** (e.g., Haircuts & Shaves) so it stays organized with related services. Finally, create a **Custom URL** — this becomes part of the booking link you’ll share with customers, making it easier to recognize and share (e.g., /haircut-booking).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054676547/original/yqgZGBSU9LVpBpkfkVGD8IgJwgJDWRym9w.jpeg?1758889071)

### **Appointment & Staff Setup**

In this section, you configure how the booking will appear to customers and staff. Set the **Appointment Invite Title**, which will show up on both customer and staff calendar invites (you can use placeholders like {{contact.name}} to personalize it). Under **Team Members**, assign one or more barbers who are qualified to perform this service — customers will only see time slots for those staff members. Then, define a **Meeting Location**: this could be the barbershop itself, a specific chair, or even a custom video link if needed. Lastly, choose a **Meeting Color** to visually distinguish this service on the internal calendar view, making it easier for staff to quickly identify the type of appointment.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054656597/original/WRH3Z7jaRTNxx4E2LphYqULyXxIPZws2rw.png?1758879690)

### **Assign Room**

In the **Rooms tab**, you connect a physical space in your barbershop to the service. A room can represent a **chair, booth, or station** where the service is performed. For example, you might assign “Salon Chair 1” for haircuts and shaves, or “Styling Chair” for blow-drying and finishing. Assigning a room ensures that once a customer books the service, that specific chair or station is reserved and cannot be double-booked. This is especially useful for shops with limited seating, as it prevents multiple appointments from being scheduled in the same spot at the same time.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054656694/original/2j8ob179waKG-rHgFd1fp899SASVttW8NA.png?1758879721)

### **Assign Equipment**

In the **Equipment tab**, you link the tools or resources needed to complete the service. Equipment can represent items like **razors, shears, or hair dryers**, and you can specify the available quantity. For example, you may assign “Razors” to a shave service or “Hair Dryer” to a styling service. When a customer books the service, the system automatically reserves the necessary equipment, making sure it isn’t overbooked across multiple appointments. This helps maintain smooth operations by guaranteeing that all required tools are available for every appointment.

## **Edit Existing Service Calendars**

To update an existing service calendar, go to **Service Calendars (v1)** under the **Meetings** tab. Find the calendar you want to edit from the list and click the **pencil icon** under the **Actions** column. This will reopen the calendar settings, allowing you to adjust details such as service name, assigned staff, availability, notifications, or resources without having to recreate the calendar.

* * *

## **Creating Service Menu**

The Service Menu lets you display multiple services or groups in a single booking page.

### **Open Service Menu**

Go to **Meetings** ➜ **Service Calendars (v1)** ➜ **Service Menu**. This brings you to the Service Menu area where customer-facing menus are created and managed.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054678383/original/_aGkwY8xRswepTkqG9I_MYUj55-N-usstQ.png?1758889945)

### **Create Service Menu**

Click **\+ Create Service Menu** in the top-right. This starts a new, customer-facing menu that will display your barbershop services.

### **Menu Details**

Complete **Service Menu name**, **Description**, and the **Service URL** slug; choose the **Form** and toggle the **Consent checkbox** if needed. These settings define what customers see at the top of the menu and the link you’ll share.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054673932/original/5Ak6HPvUWBMjlWM8O4Gog62kpmEubC991g.png?1758887849)

### **Enable Options**

Under **Additional Options**, toggle **Enable Add Guests**, **Enable Multiple Service Selection**, and **Enable Staff Selection**. These controls let customers book for guests, select multiple services (e.g., haircut + shave), and pick a preferred barber.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054673971/original/2JHKx1YR0fneUguh4j7fi5JctWcprFHcZQ.png?1758887870)

### **Select Services**

Click **Select Services** and choose the **groups/calendars** to include in this menu. Only services you’ve already created and assigned to groups will appear; expand a group to check specific services.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054674071/original/svsdbwWlrsjXhanbhM3326mdg6h2gB_c5Q.png?1758887896)

### **Arrange Order**

Open **Arrange your services**, then drag the handles to reorder how groups/services appear. Place your most popular items (e.g., Haircut, Shave) at the top to improve conversions.
