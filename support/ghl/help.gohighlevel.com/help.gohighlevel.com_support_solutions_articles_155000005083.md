# Reselling and Rebilling through SaaS V2 Payment Providers

Modified on: Wed, 16 Apr, 2025 at 9:19 AM

The SaaS V2 system allows you to bill clients via your agency sub-account. That goes for SaaS subscriptions, reselling, and rebilling. This document outlines how the reselling and rebilling works with this setup, and what products are supported.

**_TLDR:_** _Sub-account wallet is used for all payments corresponding to reselling and rebilling._

## Reselling Using Sub-Account Wallet

2. Prospecting

3. Client Portal

4. Listings (Yext)

5. Wordpress

6. AI Employee

7. SEO

**List of supported products:**

01. Phone System

02. Email

03. LC - Premium Triggers & Actions

04. LC Email Verification

05. Content AI

06. Workflow AI

## How to Enable Reselling and Rebilling for V2 Sub-Accounts?
