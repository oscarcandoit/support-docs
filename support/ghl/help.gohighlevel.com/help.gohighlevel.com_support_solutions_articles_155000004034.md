## **What Is Blog Post Importer?**

If you already have a blog outside of HighLevel, you can use Blog Post Importer to automatically scrape the blog and create posts in HighLevel. No need to rewrite, copy & paste, download & upload, etc. Just set it and wait for the process to finish.

* * *

## **How To Import Blog Posts**

### **Step 1: Open Blog List**

Navigate to Sites > Blogs to see the Blog List. Click on an existing Blog or click Create Blog and select from scratch or from Template.

### **Step 2: Open Blog Post Importer**

Navigate to the Blog Post List of an existing or new Blog. Click on New Post > Import Blog Posts from URL.

```
Sitemap

Ensure you have a public sitemap before you try to import blog posts from your blog. The sitemap is necessary for the mapping and scraping. For example, blog.abc.com/sitemap.xml.

Supported Blogs

Currently Hubspot and Wordpress are supported. We do not yet support Wix, Medium, etc.
```

### **Step 3: Start Importer**

On the Import Blog Posts from URL page you will see three phases. Start with **Setup your Import**: Enter your blog homepage, a recent post, and your platform. When you click Continue you will see that you have to wait for the mapping to complete.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049323674/original/fz97lujKgQOHoDL9CLnF7zY-laKzTnYqqw.png?1751595257)

### **Step 4: Map Contents**

Back in the Blog Post List on the **Imported Contents** tab, wait to see the **Scan Ended** pill, then click on Review Results.

On the Import Blog Posts from URL page at Step **Map Contents**: follow the instructions to identify which elements on the page correspond to which pieces of information in your blog posts.

You can see that all the mapping is done when all the check marks are green.

When you are done mapping the content you will return to the Blog Post List > Imported Contents tab and you will see an **Import In Progress** pill.

```
Import Time

Expect about 10-20 minutes for 1,000 posts.

Scan/Results Error

If the blog sitemap doesn't have a URL, then the blog posts cannot be imported. Currently you will see 'Scan in progress' for the interim 'Failure' state which upon clicking shows a blank page.
```

When the import is done you will see the pill change to **Import Done**.

### **Step 5: Publish Posts**

When you are on the Imported Contents tab and you see the Import Done status then click Review Results. Back on the Import Blog Posts from URL page Phase Publish Posts you can see a report of the mapped content.

Click Continue and you'll return to the Blog Post List page. You will see that now the posts show up under the Blog Posts tab not under Imported Content.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049323867/original/S_HzorVBXHE7Y-epA-qLtj1iJnc10Osqig.png?1751596163)

All the new Blog Posts will be set to **Draft** status. Now you can review/edit them and when you're ready set their status to Published or Scheduled. Click on the three-dot action menu, then click Edit Post.
