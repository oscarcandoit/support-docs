## Overview

The **Calendar View** is your central hub for managing appointments and bookings. It’s designed to adapt based on the type of scheduling you use — giving you a focused experience whether you’re handling meetings or service bookings.

* * *

## Scheduling Types in Calendar View

Currently, there are **two scheduling types** available:

### Meetings

- Best for sales calendars, personal booking, collective calendars, classes, or round robin scheduling.

- Includes all existing calendar types (personal, round robin, collective, class, service calendars v1, and service menu).

- Designed for anyone managing internal or client-facing meetings.


### Services

- Purpose-built for **service-based businesses**.

- Supports advanced options such as **variations, add-ons, multiple services and staff specific pricing**.

- Helps manage bookings that involve staff, different service types, or multiple locations.


* * *

## Enabling or Disabling Scheduling Types

- Scheduling types can be **enabled or disabled from Agency Settings**.

- If only one type is enabled, the Calendar View will automatically load that type, and the top dropdown will remain hidden.

- If both Meetings and Services are enabled, a **dropdown menu** appears at the top of Calendar View, allowing you to switch between them.


* * *

## How the View Changes

When you select a **scheduling type** from the dropdown at the top of Calendar View:

- The **layout and filters** on the right panel automatically adjust to match the selected type.

- The **events and blocked slots** shown in the calendar are specific to that scheduling type only.

- This ensures you always see relevant information without cross-type clutter.


* * *

## Filters by Scheduling Type

### Meetings View Filters

- **Users** → Show calendars linked to specific users.

- **Calendars** → Toggle specific calendars (personal, round robin, collective, class, etc.).

- **Groups** → Filter events by calendar groups.

### Services View Filters

- **Staff** → Show events by assigned staff members.

- **Services** → Display bookings tied to specific services.

- **Categories** → Narrow down results by service categories.

- **Unified Service Booking View** →

  - When enabled, each **Service Booking** appears as a **single block** on the calendar, with all its appointments grouped inside.

  - **Note**: Staff, Service, and Category filters won’t be available in this view since it displays all appointments together.

  - **Location Filter** becomes available — you can filter appointments based on the **location** where they were booked.

## Additional Calendar Controls

- **Month View Access**: The mini month-view calendar is located under the **main date**. Click the date to expand it.

- **Hide/Show Filters**: Use the **Manage View** button (top-right) to hide the right filter panel for more space, or bring it back when needed.

## Tips

- Enable **Unified Service Booking View** for a simpler overview of service bookings across staff and categories.

- Use **location filtering** in Services View to focus on bookings in a specific branch.

- Hide the right panel when presenting or reviewing busy calendars.

- Use the mini month-view to quickly navigate across dates.


* * *

## Limitation: Third-Party Calendar Updates

In **Services View**, any changes made directly on third-party calendars (such as **Google Calendar, Outlook, or iCal**) will **not** be reflected inside HighLevel.

- To ensure your calendar stays accurate, **all updates** (rescheduling, cancellations, or edits) must be made **within HighLevel**.
