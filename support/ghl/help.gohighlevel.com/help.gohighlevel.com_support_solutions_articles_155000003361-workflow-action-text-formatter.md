## **Suggested Triggers**

- **Form Submission:** trigger the Text Formatter action after a form is submitted to ensure the data is properly formatted (ex: fill in a default value "no answer" if a field is blank).

- **New Contact Created:** Automatically format text fields when a new contact is added to your CRM (ex: names are capitalized correctly)

- **Webhook Received:** Automatically format the text received from an external system (talk to your developer about this one).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use the Text Formatter to personalize messages?**

A: Yes! You can combine the Text Formatter with custom values and merge fields to create personalized messages with properly formatted text.

**Q: Is it possible to chain multiple formatting actions together?**

A: Yes! You can add multiple Text Formatter actions within a workflow to perform complex text transformations step by step.

**Q: Does the Text Formatter work on numbers?**

A: Sort of. If the numbers are in text form, then they can be manipulated like text. If the numbers are in numeric form, then use the [Number Formatter action](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003355).

**Q: I can't find the field my text is in.**

A: Double check the table to make sure that field is included and drill down deep enough to select it.
