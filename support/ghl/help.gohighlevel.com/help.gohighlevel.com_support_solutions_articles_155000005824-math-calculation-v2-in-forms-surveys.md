## **What’s New**

### **Support for Additional Field Types**

You can now assign custom numeric scores to the following fields:

- Radio Select
- Checkbox
- Single Dropdown
- Multi Dropdown

Each selectable option in these fields can have a unique score.

### **Expanded Calculation Logic**

These new field types can be combined with existing Number and Monetary fields to support more complex and customized scoring logic.

### **Real-Time Calculations in Preview Mode**

As users make selections, scores are calculated instantly in preview mode, helping you validate and test your form’s logic before going live.

⸻

## **How to Use Math Calculations**

1. **Add Supported Fields**

Open your form or survey and use the Quick Add menu to drag in any of the following fields:
   - Radio Select
   - Checkbox
   - Single Dropdown
   - Multi Dropdown
2. **Assign Option Scores**

Click into each field and assign a score to each option. These values will contribute to the total calculation.

3. **Configure Calculation Logic**

Use the form builder’s calculation settings to define how scores from different fields should be totaled, added, or otherwise manipulated.

4. **Preview in Real Time**



Switch to Preview Mode to test your form or survey. The total score will update immediately as users select different options.

⸻

## **Example Use Cases**

•Quizzes and Knowledge Checks: Automatically calculate a user’s score based on their answers.

•Budgeting Tools: Sum up user-selected services or products to provide a running total.

•Lead Qualification: Score responses to qualify leads based on their input.

•Self-Assessments: Give users instant feedback based on their choices.

⸻

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

Can I assign decimal or negative scores to options?

Yes, you can assign both decimal and negative values to field options for more flexible scoring.

Do calculations work on live forms or just in preview?

Calculations are shown in Preview Mode during setup. For live forms, you’ll need to configure how scores are displayed or used (e.g., passed to custom fields, hidden fields, or confirmation pages).

Can I use conditions or logic based on the calculated score?

While the form builder itself supports calculations, conditional logic based on score output may require using workflows or custom automation for follow-up actions.

Are older forms affected by this update?

No. Existing forms will continue to function as before. You’ll need to manually update any forms to take advantage of the new calculation features.

Is this available in surveys as well as forms?

Yes, this update applies to both Forms and Surveys.
