- [How It Works:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004643-ad-manager-affiliate-tracking#How-It-Works%3A)
- [Notes:](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004643-ad-manager-affiliate-tracking#notes:)

For every in-app pricing plan upgrade made by the agency via affiliates, the affiliates earn a commission of 40%. Our Affiliate partners would now get incentivised for promoting Ad Manager to our agencies and make an earning out of it.

## **What’s New?**

- We've introduced a dedicated Affiliate tracking mechanism for Ad Manager under agency view reselling.
- If an agency is coming via an affiliate, their unique code can be entered when agency upgrades from 'Standard' to 'Utility' or 'Founder's Offer' plans.

## **How It Works:**

Under agency Reselling view > on the ad manager card:

1. When the agency chooses to upgrade to Utility or Founder's offer from standard plan, they can choose to add the unique affiliate code.
2. On click of upgrade and making the payment, agency is upgraded to the selected plan with an affiliate commission of 40% of the plan value credited to the affiliate.
3. Your referrer will earn a 40% commission from every agency that upgrades to Utility ($97/month) or Founder's Offer($970/year) plan of Ad Manager subscription.

## **Notes:**

- Price at which agency opts for the upgrade remains the same, the commission which an affiliate withdraws is between HL and the affiliate whose unique code is entered.
