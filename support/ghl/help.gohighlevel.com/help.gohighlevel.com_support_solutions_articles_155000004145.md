## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Does Online Listings cost more in certain countries?**

No. Pricing is flat per sub‑account, regardless of market.

**Q: How long does it take for listings to go live?**

Most publishers update within 24 hours; some directories may take up to 72 hours.

**Q: Will publisher counts or supported countries change over time?**

Yes. HighLevel Listings continually adds and retires directory partners, and expands into new markets based on demand.

**Q: Can my agency use Online Listings for clients in varying countries?**

Each sub‑account’s coverage depends on its country setting. You can enable Listings for any sub‑account located in a supported market; clients in unsupported regions will see the availability banner.
