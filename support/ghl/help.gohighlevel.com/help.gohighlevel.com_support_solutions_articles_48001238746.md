## **What is the Revenue Analytics feature?**

Revenue Analytics is a powerful feature designed to help businesses make better decisions about their marketing strategies by providing a granular view of revenue data. It enables businesses to track their one-time purchase revenue and analyze revenue distribution across different purchase channels and offers. By filtering the data by date and purchase channel, businesses can gain insights into the revenue generated from other sources, allowing them to make data-driven decisions about allocating resources and optimizing their marketing strategies.

The Net Revenue and Revenue by Offer charts give businesses an overview of their revenue performance, including the total units sold, total revenue, and the distribution of the top four offers. The list of top four offers and their revenue contribution percentage helps businesses identify their top-performing offers and optimize their marketing strategies to promote them. Additionally, by analyzing the performance of different offers across different channels through the Compare Offers feature, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies to promote their top-performing offers across all channels.

The ability to filter data by date and purchase channel gives businesses a granular view of revenue data, allowing them to analyze revenue trends over time and identify the most profitable channels and offers. By leveraging these insights, businesses can make data-driven decisions about allocating resources and optimizing their marketing strategies, leading to increased profitability and a more efficient operation.

### **Net Revenue**

The Net Revenue tab is one of the two main tabs in Revenue Analytics, and it provides businesses with a detailed view of their revenue generated from one-time purchases. The tab displays data for one-time purchases and allows users to filter by date and purchase channel.

The following is a breakdown of the key features of the Net Revenue tab:

- Total units sold
- Total revenue
- Distribution of top four offers in the given date range
- Filter options for date and purchase channel

**Total Units Sold:** This shows the total number of units sold during the selected date range and purchase channel. For example, a clothing retailer can use this feature to identify the total number of clothing items sold in their online store during the last 30 days.

**Total Revenue:** This shows the revenue generated during the selected date range and purchase channel. For example, an online retailer can use this feature to identify the total revenue generated from sales on their website during the last 6 months.

**Distribution of Top Four Offers:** This feature displays the distribution of the top four offers during the selected date range and purchase channel. The list shows the top four offers and their revenue contribution percentage to the total revenue generated during the selected date range and purchase channel. For example, a software company can use this feature to identify the top four software products that generate the most revenue during the last year.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48295413790/original/1HjpKxDBIxm0OABPMJk9GqOPeVus1m1nHw.png?1683032318)

**Filter Options:** The Net Revenue tab allows users to filter data by date and purchase channel. The date filter enables users to select a specific date range. In contrast, the purchase channel filter lets users choose from up to four available options: Membership checkout, Funnel, and Upsell checkout.

### **Compare Offers**

The Compare Offers tab is the second main tab in Revenue Analytics. It enables businesses to compare the performance of different offers and see the revenue generated from each offer. The tab allows users to compare up to **four offers** simultaneously and filter the data by the offer, purchase channel, and date.

The following is a breakdown of the key features of the Compare Offers tab:

- Total units sold
- Total revenue
- Filtering options for the offer, purchase channel, and date

**Total Units Sold:** This shows the total number of units sold for each offer during the selected date range and purchase channel. For example, a health and wellness company can use this feature to compare the number of units sold for their weight loss program and yoga classes during the last 6 months.

**Total Revenue:** This shows the total revenue generated for each offer during the selected date range and purchase channel. For example, an e-commerce company can use this feature to compare the revenue generated from their top-selling products during the last year.

**Filter Options:** The Compare Offers tab allows users to filter data by the offer, purchase channel, and date. The offer filter lets users select up to four offers to compare. In contrast, the purchase channel filter lets users choose from up to four available options: Membership checkout, Funnel, and Upsell checkout. The date filter enables users to select a specific date range.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48295414337/original/PqlQe7zGA5VF_8tI3HE8Pkfxn2-k66Isxg.png?1683032476)
