# Business Profile Settings - Authorized Representative

Modified on: Fri, 29 Aug, 2025 at 3:57 PM

Authorized Representative identifies a real person who can verify and speak for the business during compliance reviews (e.g., A2P 10DLC brand/campaign approvals). Adding a reachable representative can prevent stalled verifications and speed up approvals.

To learn more about the Business Profile Settings, including how to navigate to the settings panel, see: [Business Profile Settings Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006223-business-profile-settings#Where-Do-I-Find-the-Business-Profile?)
