# **What are Bulk Actions on the Product Page?**

The _Bulk Actions_ feature allows store owners to efficiently manage large sets of products from a single interface. You can now select multiple products and apply key updates across store visibility, pricing, collections, and more in a only few clicks! This is ideal for large catalogs or frequent price/stock updates.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Bulk Actions**

- **Save Time:** Apply one change to hundreds of items in a few clicks.

- **Consistency:** Ensure pricing or inventory policies are uniform across variants and products.

- **Error Reduction:** Preview and validation reduce mistakes compared to manual edits.

- **Scalability:** Filters and pagination help you manage large catalogs confidently.

- **Operational Accuracy:** Keep stock levels and selling rules aligned with real-world inventory.


* * *

## **Available Bulk Actions**

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Include in Online Store** | Include selected products from appearing in the online store. |
| **Exclude in Online Store** | Exclude selected products from appearing in the online store. |
| **Change Price** | Increase, decrease, or set new prices across products using fixed values or percentages. |
| **Change Compare-at Price** | Same pricing options as above, applied to the 'Compare-at Price' field. |
| **Add to Collections** | Add products to one or more collections, or create new collections on the fly. |
| **Delete** | Remove selected products in bulk, with a safety confirmation modal. |

```
⚠️ Caution: Price updates affect all variants of the selected product.
```

* * *

## **How to Access Bulk Actions**

#### **Step 1:** Go to Products

Navigate to **Payments > Products** inside your Ecommerce Store.

#### **Step 2:** Select Products

- Use the checkbox on each row to select individual products, or click the top checkbox to select all on the current page.

- To select all products in the sub-account, use the **“Select All”** prompt that appears after selecting all on one page.

#### **Step 3:** Select Bulk Action

Open the **Bulk Actions** dropdown to apply your desired change.

## **Filtering Products for Bulk Actions**

Use the filtering panel to narrow down product selection before applying bulk actions. You can combine filters with Select All for more targeted bulk operations. Using filters to isolate a group before performing actions can reduce the risk of editing the wrong products.

Available filters include:

- **Store Visibility:** Included / Hidden

- **Collections:** By name

- **Source:** All Products, Woocommerce


To apply a filter, click the **Filters** button in the upper right corner then choose your filters from the drop down.

* * *

## **Edge Cases & Important Notes**

### **Behavior & Limitations:**

- **Negative Value Protection**: Price changes that would lead to a negative value will be skipped for those products. Others will still update.

- **One Action at a Time**: You must wait for the current bulk operation to complete before starting a new one.

- **Global Store Visibility**: Visibility changes apply across all connected stores. To exclude a specific store, use the **Sites** section instead _(Sites > Stores > Select a Store > Products)_.

- **Value Required for Price Updates**: ‘Increase’ or ‘Decrease’ actions require an existing value for Price or Compare-at Price. Products without a base value remain unaffected.

- **Deletion Confirmation for Large Sets**: Deleting more than 50 products requires typing **“Delete”** in the confirmation prompt. Deleted products cannot be recovered.

- **Bulk Performance Warning**: Changes on over 300 products may take a few moments to reflect.


### **Selection Behaviour:**

| Action | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click top checkbox | Selects all products on the current page. |
| Navigate away and return | Selection is retained (for current page selection only). |
| Use “Select All” for entire list | If you navigate away, the selection will **not** be retained. |

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will bulk updates affect variants?**
