# **Benefits**

- **Restricted Viewing:** Limit video viewing up to a specific timestamp.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** Engage your audience and generate leads effortlessly.
- **Incentivize Viewers:** Lock the most captivating part of the video to encourage course sign-ups, registrations, and more.
- **Video Funnels:** Utilize our beautiful forms to transform your video into a lead generation funnel.

# **How to Use:**

- Add the "Video" element and choose the "Hosted Video" option.
- Enable the "Generate leads from video" setting.
- Enter the desired timestamp when you would like to the form to appear (in hours, minutes, or seconds).
- Choose a form to display at the specified timestamp.
- Decide whether to allow users to close the form and continue watching. If this option is disabled, viewers must submit the form for the video to proceed.

- This feature requires the "Hosting Video" option since this is the only video type that supports time tracking.
- The feature is incompatible with video elements inside popups to avoid overlay issues.
