# **What is Content Library for Documents & Contracts?**

The Content Library is a centralized set of reusable components inside the Documents & Contracts editor and the template editor. You can save either a single block (for example, a pricing card or signature table) or an entire page, then drag and drop those saved items into new templates or documents, ensuring consistency and speed.

## **Key Benefits of the Content Library for Documents & Contracts**

Understanding the value helps you adopt the feature effectively. Below are the primary ways the Content Library improves throughput, brand consistency, and operational scale for agencies and teams.

- **Speed:** assemble proposals and contracts in seconds by reusing prebuilt blocks or full pages.

- **Consistency:** enforce uniform branding, terms, layouts, and structure across teams and clients.

- **Scale:** distribute best-practice components to every location with a single share action.

- **Quality control:** promote vetted components to the library so editors start from approved content.

- **Lower training overhead:** new team members can build quickly from a curated set of components.
