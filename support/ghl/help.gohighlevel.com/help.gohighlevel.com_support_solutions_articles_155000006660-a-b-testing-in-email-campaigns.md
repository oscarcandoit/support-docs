# A/B Testing in Email Campaigns

Modified on: Tue, 21 Oct, 2025 at 3:12 PM

## **Overview**

Boost your email performance with **A/B Testing** in the Email Builder. A/B testing allows you to send up to **six variations** of your email (either subject line or content) to a portion of your audience.

The system automatically identifies the **winning version** based on engagement metrics, such as open rate or click rate and sends that version to the remaining recipients.

## **What Is A/B Testing?**

A/B Testing (also called split testing) is a method used to compare two or more versions of an email to determine which performs better.

By testing small variations like subject lines or content, you can understand what resonates best with your audience and improve engagement over time.

* * *

## **Why Use A/B Testing**

- **Optimise engagement:** Identify which email version drives higher open or click rates.

- **Data-backed decisions:** Eliminate guesswork by using real recipient behaviour.

- **Improve deliverability:** Refine subject lines and send times for better inbox placement.

- **Boost conversions:** Use performance insights to continuously enhance your email strategy.

## ⚙️ **How to Enable A/B Testing**

01. Open your **Email Campaign** in the **Email Builder**.

    ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055819742/original/w97LQSt9TmdJAWuhEJs3HYC70m1z1smckQ.png?1760340432)

02. Toggle **Enable A/B Testing** on the left panel.

03. Choose the **Test Type**:

    - **Email Subject:** Test different subject lines to find which attracts more opens.

    - **Email Content:** Test variations in content, such as images, buttons, or copy.
04. Set the **Test Duration** (e.g., 4 hours, 8 hours, etc.).

    - This determines how long the test runs before selecting a winner.
05. Choose the **Number of Variations** (up to 6).

06. Adjust the **Test Size** using the slider.

    - Example: If you test two variations (A and B), you might send each to 25% of your audience and reserve the remaining 50% for the winning version.

08. Add your **Subject Variations** or **Content Variations**.

    - Optionally, use **Content AI** to generate creative variations automatically.
09. Choose your **Winning Criteria**:

    - **Unique Open Rate** → Best for subject line tests.

    - **Unique Click Rate** → Best for content tests.

11. Once configured, click **Send or Schedule**. The system will automatically run the test and deliver the best-performing version to the remaining audience.


* * *

## **Winning Criteria Explained**

- **Unique Open Rate:** The version that gets the highest number of unique opens wins.

- **Unique Click Rate:** The version that generates the most clicks wins.

After the test duration ends, the winning email automatically goes out to the remaining percentage of your audience.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the maximum number of variations I can test?**

You can test up to **six** variations at a time.

**Q: Can I test both subject lines and content in the same A/B test?**

No. You can choose only one test type per campaign, either **Email Subject** or **Email Content**.

**Q: Will the results appear in Analytics?**

Yes. You can view A/B test results for open rate, click rate, and winner in your **Campaign Statistics** dashboard.

**Q: Can I reuse the winning variation for future campaigns?**

Absolutely! Duplicate the winning version and use it as a starting point for future campaigns.
