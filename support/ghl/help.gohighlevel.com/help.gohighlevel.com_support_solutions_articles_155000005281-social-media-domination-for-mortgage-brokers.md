## Why This Playbook Matters

You know how to structure loans, close fast, and guide buyers through tough financial decisions—but are you showing up where your borrowers are already looking?

Most mortgage pros still rely on old-school marketing: postcards, cold calls, and waiting for agents to refer. But today’s borrowers scroll first, then decide who to trust with their mortgage.

- **77% of first-time homebuyers check social media before choosing a lender**

- **60% of millennial borrowers say social proof influences who they apply with**

- **Loan officers who post consistently get 3X more online applications than those who don’t**


Yet most brokers:

- Post inconsistently (or not at all)

- Don't track what content drives applications

- Miss leads sitting in their DMs or comments


This playbook fixes that.

You’ll learn how to show up with confidence, build trust through content, and convert attention into closings—without burning out.

```
Start using HighLevel to automate, convert and grow.
```

* * *

## What You’ll Learn

✅ How to build a magnetic social media presence that attracts borrowers

✅ What platforms drive real mortgage business (and which to skip)

✅ How to turn followers into leads using automated DMs, CTAs & lead magnets

✅ How to use low-cost Facebook & Instagram ads to boost local awareness

✅ How to automate posting, replying, and follow-ups with HighLevel

* * *

## Step 1: Build a Lender Brand That Attracts & Converts

### Why It Matters

Borrowers don’t care about your NMLS ID—they want to feel trust, ease, and clarity.

Social media builds that **emotional trust** before you ever get on the phone.

* * *

### 1.1 Pick the Right Platforms

✅ **Facebook** – For first-time buyers, past clients, and agent partners

✅ **Instagram** – Showcase pre-approval wins, closings, home tips

✅ **LinkedIn** – Build referral relationships with agents, CPAs, and attorneys

✅ **YouTube** – Deep dives on mortgage options = long-term lead generation

✅ **Google Business Profile (GBP)** – Not “social” but mission-critical for search

**Pro Tip:** GBP posts show up in Google Maps & local searches—post weekly to rank higher!

* * *

### 1.2 Optimize Your Profiles

✅ Use a clean headshot, company branding, and consistent bio

✅ Add a **“Start Your Pre-Approval”** link in your bio or pinned post

✅ Use a booking calendar or HighLevel form to capture warm leads

✅ Pin client testimonial videos or “How I Saved $312/mo On My Mortgage” posts

* * *

## Step 2: Create High-Converting, Mortgage-Relevant Content

### Why It Matters

Most brokers post only rate sheets or generic "Happy Friday!" memes.

That doesn’t convert.

The secret? Use content to educate and **pre-sell**—not pitch.

* * *

### The 80/20 Rule

✅ 80%: Education, FAQs, inspiration, client success

✅ 20%: Direct lead gen offers (free calls, rate check, refi calculator)

* * *

### 2.1 Content That Converts

✅ Before & After: “She paid off $24k in credit card debt by refinancing at 5.5%!”

✅ Myth vs. Fact: “You don’t need 20% down to buy a home”

✅ Weekly Loan Tip: “3 ways to get pre-approved without hurting your credit”

✅ Live Q&A: “Is now a bad time to buy? Let’s talk.”

✅ Client Testimonial: Video clips of closing day wins

✅ Educational Snippets: "What’s a 2-1 buydown and how does it help your buyer win?"

* * *

### 2.2 Use Hashtags & Tags

✅ Instagram: #MortgageBroker #FirstTimeHomebuyer #HomeLoanTips

✅ LinkedIn: #LoanOfficerLife #RefinanceTips #AgentPartners

✅ GBP: Post keyword-based content like “Home loan expert in \[Your City\]”

* * *

## Step 3: Run Low-Cost Ads That Drive Local Borrower Leads

### Why It Matters

Only 5-10% of your followers see unpaid posts.

**Paid ads ensure you show up to buyers and agents before competitors.**

* * *

### 3.1 Ad Types That Work for Brokers

✅ **Lead Form Ads** – “Check today’s rates” or “Get pre-approved in 60 seconds”

✅ **Retargeting Ads** – For website visitors who didn’t apply

✅ **Agent-Facing Ads** – “Let’s partner on your next listing”

✅ **YouTube Discovery** – 60-second explainer ads like: “Should you wait to buy?”

* * *

### 3.2 Targeting That Converts

✅ Location: By ZIP codes or city radius

✅ Demographics: 25-55 age range, married, new parents, homeowners

✅ Interests: Zillow, Realtor.com, mortgage calculators, FHA/VA/USDA

**Exclude renters & irrelevant demos** to save money

* * *

### 3.3 Suggested Ad Budget

| Business Size | Suggested Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Solo LO | $10/day (~$300/mo) |
| Small Branch | $25/day (~$750/mo) |
| Multi-LO Office | $50+/day (~$1500+/mo) |

* * *

## Step 4: Automate It All With HighLevel

### Why It Matters

You don’t have time to post, reply, chase leads, and write emails—every minute you're doing that, you're not locking loans.

* * *

### 4.1 Auto-Schedule Your Content

✅ Use HighLevel’s **Social Media Planner**

✅ Schedule weekly content in 30 minutes, post 3-5x/week

✅ Auto-post across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn & GBP

* * *

### 4.2 Automate DM Responses & Lead Nurture

✅ Set up keyword-based replies: "Refi", "Buy", "Pre-approval"

✅ Trigger a form, calendar, or SMS to capture info

✅ Use **Conversation AI** to chat, qualify, and follow up 24/7

* * *

### 4.3 Track What Works

✅ See which posts got DMs, clicks, or form submissions

✅ Monitor ad spend, CPL, and ROI from the HighLevel dashboard

✅ Retarget leads who didn’t convert the first time

* * *

## Step 5: Plug into a Proven Weekly Social Strategy

### Why It Matters

Brokers who post randomly = inconsistent pipeline.

Structure = predictability.

* * *

### Weekly Content Blueprint

| Day | Content Type | Platform |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Homebuyer Tip / Loan Myth | IG, FB |
| Tuesday | Agent Testimonial / Partnership | LinkedIn, FB |
| Wednesday | Rate Update / Refinancing Tip | IG Reels, Stories |
| Thursday | Live Q&A / “Ask Me Anything” | FB Live, IG Stories |
| Friday | Lead Gen Offer / Free Consultation | FB Ads, GBP Post |
| Saturday | Behind The Scenes / Lifestyle | IG Stories |
| Sunday | Google Business Post | GBP |

* * *

## Final Thoughts: Why Social = Closings

✅ The more you show up, the more you get remembered

✅ The more value you share, the more trust you earn

✅ The more conversations you create, the more applications you close

* * *
