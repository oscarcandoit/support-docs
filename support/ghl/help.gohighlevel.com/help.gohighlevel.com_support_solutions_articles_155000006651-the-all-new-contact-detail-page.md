## **What is the All-New Contact Detail Page?**

Re-engineered from the ground up, the Contact Detail Page is the central workspace where you can review contact information, track conversations, log activities, and launch actions—now optimized for speed and usability. The redesign replaces endless scrolling with a three-panel layout, surfaces critical data at a glance, and remembers your personal view preferences for a truly streamlined CRM experience.

* * *

## **Key Improvements at a Glance**

- **Modern design:** Faster, consistent, and visually streamlined layout.

- **Auto-Save:** Changes save automatically when you leave a field — no clicks needed.

- **Smart Navigation:** Move between contacts using keyboard shortcuts.

- **Collapsible panels:** Focus on what matters most, and the system remembers your layout.

- **Inline associations:** View and edit Companies, Opportunities, and Custom Objects right from the contact page.

- **Cleaner right panel:** Unified experience for Tasks, Notes, Documents, Payments, and Appointments.

- **Hide empty fields:** Reduce clutter and view only what’s filled.

- **Search inside fields:** Quickly locate data or folders.


* * *

## **Left Panel: Contact Information**

This is where you’ll find and manage all the key details about your contact.

**Key Actions:** Edit the profile picture directly.

## **Auto-Save: How It Works**

Auto-Save is one of the most powerful new additions.

When enabled, **your edits are saved automatically** the moment you leave a field — no manual “Save” click required.

**Steps**: Open any contact record. Make an edit — you’ll see a **Save bar** appear at the bottom. Click on "Enable Auto-Save" from the kebab (3 dots) menu.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056157667/original/v1gsiG7FiFft22yhfQgr2e5GKTXSEVrOAQ.png?1760623346)

Click **“Enable Auto-Save”** when prompted.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055793497/original/sd_dilWAx91RpPK6y4HHqZGFe5eMxpzrEw.png?1760264176)

Confirm from the modal — this will apply the setting to your sub-account. Admins can also enable or disable Auto-Save from: **Settings → Contacts → Details Tab → Auto-Save toggle**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055793499/original/lBmu2nddaOpGl69KHwW1vRwhs4U7yn-WCg.png?1760264183)**

> _Once enabled, all users in the sub-account will automatically save edits as they work._

* * *

## **Keyboard Shortcuts**

Save time with these new shortcuts:

- **→ / ←** — Move between contacts in the list.

- **ESC** — Collapse right panel.

- **CTRL + S (or CMD + S)** — Manual save (if Auto-Save is off).

* * *

## **Quality of Life Enhancements**

- Panels and tabs now **remember your last state** — no need to re-expand or collapse each time.

- Consistent spacing, typography, and component behavior for a professional, clutter-free look.

- Unified design language and **empty states** across all modules (Tasks, Documents, Notes, Payments).

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will Auto-Save apply to everyone in my account?**

Yes. Once enabled by an admin, Auto-Save is active for all users in that sub-account.

**Q: Can I revert changes saved by Auto-Save?**

You can always edit a field again — Auto-Save updates the record immediately, maintaining a complete activity log.

**Q: Why can’t I see the “Enable Auto-Save” button?**

You may already have it enabled. Check under **Settings → Contacts → Details Tab.**
