# How to Create & Manage Appointment Notes & Sync them Across Records

Modified on: Thu, 13 Nov, 2025 at 10:09 AM

Capture key context once and have it follow you wherever you work. In HighLevel, appointment notes automatically appear on the related Contact, Opportunity, and Conversation records so everyone sees the same information. This guide covers how to create, manage, and filter notes—and clarifies what syncs with Google/Outlook and what stays internal. Use it to streamline handoffs, reduce retyping, and keep every interaction actionable.

# **What are Notes for Appointments in HighLevel?**

Notes for appointments capture internal context tied to a single calendar event in HighLevel. When you add one, it automatically becomes available on the associated Contact, Opportunity, and Conversation records.

Edits and deletions to the appointment note are reflected everywhere the note appears, so you never retype or reconcile versions. Each note records who added it and when, supporting accountability and handoffs. Notes are internal to HighLevel; external calendar descriptions remain separate and do not replace these notes.

You’ll see three types of content in the appointment’s Notes area: **user-added notes** (these propagate to Contact/Opportunity/Conversation), the **booker’s Additional Information** from the booking form (visible **only in the Appointment Modal**), and **Google/Outlook event descriptions** if two-way sync is enabled (also **Appointment Modal only**). Internal notes **never sync out** to external calendars. With two-way sync, Google/Outlook descriptions can **sync into** the appointment for reference.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Notes for Appointments**

Understanding these benefits helps your team rely on Notes as the shared source of truth for appointment context.

- **Consistency**: One note tied to the appointment appears on Contact, Opportunity, and Conversation.

- **Real-time updates**: Edit once and changes are reflected everywhere the note is shown.

- **Findability**: Filter by source—User, Workflow, or API—to focus on the entries that matter.

- **Accountability**: Each note records the author and timestamp for clear ownership.

* * *

## **How Notes Flow Across Different Modules**

Appointment notes travel with the contact so you can see the same context without jumping back to the calendar. The note you create on an appointment is the _same_ note you’ll see elsewhere; viewing or editing it from any module shows identical content, author, and timestamp.

- **Contacts:** Open **Contacts** → select the person → check the right-side **Notes** panel (and the **Appointments** card) to view or edit the appointment’s internal note.

- **Conversations:** Open **Conversations** → select a conversation → use the right-side **Notes** panel to view or edit the appointment note tied to that contact.

- **Opportunities:** Open **Opportunities** → click the relevant opportunity → choose **Notes** in the drawer to view or edit the appointment note linked to that opportunity’s contact.

Use this quick matrix to confirm what appears where:

| **Input Type** | **Appointment Modal** | **Contact** | **Opportunity** | **Conversation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Internal appointment note (User/Workflow/API)** | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Contact note (added on Contact)** | — | ✔ | — | — |
| **Booker’s Additional Information** | ✔ | — | — | — |
| **Google/Outlook event description** | ✔ | — | — | — |

### **Status**

- Use the **Appointment List View** tabs (**Upcoming, Cancelled, All**) or the **Status** field in the Edit Details panel to navigate appointments. Notes remain accessible regardless of appointment status; changing status does not delete notes.

### **Delete or edit a note (⋮ menu)**

- Open the appointment → **Internal Note(s)**. On the note card, click the **⋮** (three dots) menu to **Edit** or **Delete** the note. Deleting a note removes it from the Contact, Opportunity, and Conversation where it appears, and it can be **restored within 30 days**.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What’s the practical difference between an internal appointment note, the Booker’s Additional Information, and a Google/Outlook event description?**

**Internal appointment notes** are created by users/Workflows/API in HighLevel and **propagate** to the associated Contact, Opportunity, and Conversation. **Booker’s Additional Information** is provided by the customer during booking and stays **on that appointment only**. **Google/Outlook event descriptions** (with two-way sync) appear **on the appointment** as external context and never push to other modules or replace internal notes.

**Q: If I edit an appointment note from the Contact/Opportunity/Conversation view, does it update the appointment too?**

Yes. It’s the same note referenced in multiple places. Editing or deleting from any surface updates the note everywhere it appears, including the appointment.

**Q: What happens to notes if I reschedule or cancel the appointment?**

Notes remain attached to the appointment record and stay visible according to the rules in this article. Changing **Status** (Confirmed, Cancelled, Showed, No Show, Invalid, Unconfirmed) does **not** remove notes.

**Q: How do notes behave with recurring or duplicated appointments?**

Notes are tied to a specific appointment instance. Create notes on each instance that needs its own context; notes aren’t copied automatically to new or duplicated events.
