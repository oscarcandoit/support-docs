## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Can the trigger handle multiple notes added in quick succession?**

Yes, the trigger activates each time a note is added. However, you can configure workflow conditions or cooldown periods to avoid redundant actions.

**How do the filters “Has Tag” and “Doesn’t Have Tag” work?**

These filters allow you to target specific contacts. “Has Tag” activates the trigger only for contacts with the specified tag, while “Doesn’t Have Tag” activates it for contacts without the specified tag.

**Can I use this trigger with other triggers in a single workflow?**

Yes, the Note Added trigger can be combined with other triggers, such as “Task Completed” or “Opportunity Stage Changed,” for advanced workflows.

**What happens if a note is deleted instead of added?**

This trigger activates only when a note is added. Deleting a note does not initiate the workflow.

**Is it possible to customize actions based on the note’s content?**

Yes, you can use workflow actions to analyze the note’s content (e.g., keywords) and perform specific actions, such as tagging or assigning tasks, based on predefined criteria.
