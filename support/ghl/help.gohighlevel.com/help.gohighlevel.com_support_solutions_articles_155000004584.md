We understand how crucial it is for businesses to manage and respond to reviews from various platforms. To make this easier for you, we’ve made it simple to integrate multiple review platforms into your account. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting review platforms like Yelp, TrustPilot, Google, and many more to centralise your reviews.

## **Key Benefits of Integrating Review Platforms**

- **Centralized Management**: View all your reviews from different platforms in one place.

- **Efficient Response**: Quickly respond to reviews across multiple platforms without having to log in to each one individually.

- **Improved Reputation Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your brand’s reputation across various sites and address concerns promptly.

- **Streamlined Workflow**: Save time by automating the review-fetching process, eliminating the need to manually check each site.

* * *

## **How to Integrate Review Platforms**

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Integrations

- Navigate to Reputation on left-side menu

- From the top menu within the Reputations page, click on the Settings option. (This brings you to the reputation settings page, not general settings)

- In the Settings menu, locate and click on the **Integrations** tab.

### **Step 2:** Configure Integrations

- On the Integrations page, you'll see an option to input your page URL for each platform. Enter the specific URL for the review platform you wish to integrate. Make sure this URL points to your business's review page (e.g., your Yelp page or your Google business profile).

- After entering the URL, click on the **Integrate** button. The platform will automatically pull in the latest reviews from that platform, displaying them in your dashboard.

- You can repeat the same steps to integrate other review platforms. Once done, all the reviews will be displayed in one place, making it easier to monitor, manage, and respond to reviews from a variety of sources.
