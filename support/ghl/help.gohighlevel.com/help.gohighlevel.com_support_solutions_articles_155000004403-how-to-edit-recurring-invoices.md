## **What’s New?**

### **Enhanced Editing Capabilities for Recurring Invoices**

- ### **Modify Frequency:** Adjust the billing cycle (e.g., weekly, monthly, annually) of your existing recurring invoices to better match your clients’ payment schedules or project timelines.

- **Change Dates:** Update the start and end dates of scheduled invoices to accommodate changes in service periods or contractual agreements.
- **Update Products/Services:** Add, remove, or alter the products and services listed in active or scheduled recurring invoices to reflect any changes in your offerings or client requirements.
- **Automated Email Alerts:** When auto-payment is enabled in an edited recurring invoice, it will automatically trigger an email notification to the user.
- **Personalization Options:** Tailor the content of these notification emails within the invoice settings to align with your brand voice.

## **How to Use the New Features**

- **Access Recurring Invoices:** Navigate to the Invoicing section in your Gohighlevel dashboard and select Recurring Invoices.
