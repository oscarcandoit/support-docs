## **What steps are mandatory to use the Auto Payout feature?**

There are two mandatory requirements to enable and use this feature:

1. Paypal Business Account Integration ( [Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002339))
2. Paypal of Affiliates added under Payout Methods ( [Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002341))

* * *

## **How do I hide the PayPal button from my Funnel/Website's order forms after integrating PayPal for affiliate payouts?**

To hide the PayPal button from your order forms but still use PayPal for affiliate payouts, follow these steps:

1. Open the Funnel or Website where you want to hide the PayPal button.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Paste the following code in the **Head Tracking Code** section:

```
<style>.paypal-content {
     display: none;
}
.order-form-v2 > div > .divider {
     display: none;
}
</style>
```

4. Click **Save**

This will hide the PayPal option from appearing on your order forms while retaining the PayPal integration for affiliate payouts.

## **Who has permission to pay affiliates using PayPal auto-payouts?**

Only **Agency Admins** and **Account Admins** have permission to pay affiliates using the PayPal auto-payout method.

* * *

## **How are payouts for recurring products handled when using PayPal?**

Payouts for recurring products are automatically generated, but you will still need to manually click the **"Pay Now"** button to complete the payment via PayPal. GHL does not process payouts automatically due to security and authentication concerns.

* * *

## **Why can't I process payouts for some affiliates using PayPal?**

Payouts can only be processed for affiliates who have a PayPal account added as their payout method. If an affiliate doesn't have a linked PayPal account, you'll see an error icon and the option to **"Add Account."**
