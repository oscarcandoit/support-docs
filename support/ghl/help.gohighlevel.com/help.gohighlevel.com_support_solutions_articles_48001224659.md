# **What is Inbound Calling on the Mobile App?**

Inbound calling on the Mobile App enables users to receive business calls made to their HighLevel phone number directly on their mobile device through the Lead Connector app. To ensure successful call delivery, both platform settings (inside the web app) and device settings (inside the mobile phone) must be configured correctly.

## **How To Enable Inbound Calling on the Mobile App**

Setting up inbound calling requires configuring your Staff Member's settings in the web app and updating permissions on the mobile device. Staff members must have their profiles configured to forward calls to their mobile apps.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the main menu.

2. Select **My Staff**.

3. Choose the specific **Staff Member** you want to enable and click the **Edit** button next to their name.

4. Click on the **Call and Voicemail Settings** tab.

5. Assign an Inbound Number. If the user needs their own direct number, select one from the dropdown list. Otherwise, calls will route based on overall call distribution settings.

6. Locate the section named **Forward Calls to** and check the box named M **obile app.**

7. Click the blue **Save** button at the bottom right corner to apply changes.

# **Common Troubleshooting Tips**

If inbound calls are not reaching your mobile app, check these areas:

- Verify that "Send calls to mobile app" is enabled and saved in the Staff settings for the staff member as shown above.

- Ensure the GoHighLevel Mobile App has all required permissions on your device.

- Check that battery optimization is disabled for the app (Android only).

- Confirm that notifications are enabled and the app is allowed to run in the background.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: What happens if I don’t enable "Send calls to mobile app"?**

The user will not receive incoming calls on their mobile app. This box must be checked for calls to be directed to the mobile app.

**Q: Do I need to keep the app open to receive calls?**

No, but the app must be allowed to run in the background and notifications must be enabled.

**Q: Can I automate a text message if I miss a call?**

Yes, you can use the Missed Call Text Back feature to automatically follow up with leads via SMS.

**Q: Why am I not receiving calls even after setup?**

Double-check that you clicked the "Save" button in Staff settings and that mobile permissions are correctly enabled.

**Q: If I log in to multiple devices, will I get called on all the devices?**

You can receive incoming calls simultaneously on up to 10 devices logged into the same user account.

Once a call is answered on any one device, the call will disconnect automatically on all other devices. This feature only applies to the same user account logged into multiple devices. It does not support multiple users sharing a login.

**Q: What if I am part of multiple sub-accounts and have inbound calling enabled?**

You will only receive inbound calls from the last sub-account you actively switched to. If the mobile app is closed (killed) and later reopened, it will remember the last sub-account and continue routing calls from that account. If you switch to a sub-account that does not have inbound calling enabled, you will no longer receive calls from any sub-account.

**Q: What happens when I get two calls and pick up one?**

If multiple devices ring for an incoming call, picking up the call on any one device will automatically disconnect the call attempt on all other devices.
