# What is SHAKEN/STIR?

Modified on: Fri, 26 Sep, 2025 at 5:05 AM

## **Overview**

SHAKEN/STIR is a set of protocols designed to authenticate caller ID information and verify that it is coming from a legitimate source. It uses **digital certificates** to validate your ownership of the phone number, ensuring carriers can trust that your calls are genuine.

When enabled, your calls are more likely to display as a **“Trusted Call”**, improving the chance that recipients pick up.

**SHAKEN/STIR** registration helps you increase the call completion and call answer rates by verifying your ownership of the phone number.

* * *

## **Why SHAKEN/STIR Matters**

- Boosts call completion and answer rates

- Helps prevent caller ID spoofing and fraud

- May display a “Trusted Call” label on outgoing calls

- Does not remove nuisance labels


* * *

## **Requirements**

- An **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** is mandatory for SHAKEN/STIR registration.

- If you don’t have an EIN, we recommend registering your number with the **[Free Call Registry](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005891-remediate-spam-likely-on-your-caller-id-using-free-caller-registry)** instead.

## **How to Enable SHAKEN/STIR**

1. **If you already registered for A2P SMS**:

   - Your phone numbers are **automatically enrolled** in SHAKEN/STIR.

   - This applies to all new A2P applications submitted after **April 23, 2025**, and older sub-accounts are also being updated automatically.

2. **If you have not registered for A2P SMS**:

   - You can manually enable SHAKEN/STIR for your numbers now from trust centre

**Tip**: SHAKEN/STIR works best when combined with **[CNAM registration](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006430-what-is-cnam-)**, which displays your business name   alongside your number.
