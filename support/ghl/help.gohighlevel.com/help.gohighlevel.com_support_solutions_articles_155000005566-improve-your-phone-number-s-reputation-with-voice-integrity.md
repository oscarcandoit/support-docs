## **Voice Integrity with High Level**

Legitimate calls shouldn’t be mistaken for spam. With HighLevel’s Voice Integrity, you can register your U.S. phone numbers with the leading caller-ID analytics firms (First Orion, Hiya, TNS) to remove “spam likely” labels, repair a troubled reputation, and boost your answer rates, especially for numbers that have been blocked or flagged in the past.

* * *

## **Why Switch on Voice Integrity?**

- **Fix a bad reputation:** Clear existing spam flags and restore trust in your caller ID.

- **Higher answer rates:** Studies show calls labeled with a recognized, branded name are far more likely to be answered.

- **Better deliverability:** Legitimate callers avoid unnecessary blocks, so your outreach and support calls reach more customers.


* * *

## **Before Registering for Voice Integrity**

Before you enable Voice Integrity, make sure you’ve met the following key requirements.

1. **SHAKEN/STIR Registration** (required)

To prove each outgoing call is authentic, you must have a valid SHAKEN/STIR attestation on your account.

2. **CNAM (Caller Name)** (recommended)

Submitting a branded name alongside your number further enhances trust in analytics platforms.

3. **U.S. Phone Numbers Only**

Voice Integrity currently applies solely to domestic traffic—international numbers are not supported.


* * *

## **Enabling Voice Integrity**

Here’s how to activate Voice Integrity in minutes and ensure your calls are marked as legitimate across the major networks. Also, please note that SHAKEN/STIR registration is required to complete the Voice Integrity form. If you don’t already have it, register before proceeding.

### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Voice Integrity Tab within the Trust Center

### **Step 2:** Complete the Registration Form

Within the Trust Center under the Voice Integrity tab, fill in:

- **Use Case:** Select the type of calls you’ll be making (e.g., sales outreach, customer support).

- **Employee Count:** Enter your organization’s size.

- **Average Business Day Call Volume**: Provide your expected daily call count.

- **CNAM Details**: (Optional) Enter your branded caller name.

```
Please Note: Once you click Submit, your Voice Integrity application is typically processed within 2 business days. You can monitor progress at any time by visiting the Submitted Applications tab in the Trust Center.
```

* * *

## **What Happens After You Register?**

Once you submit your information, each of the analytics providers—Hiya, TNS, and First Orion—will review your registration separately.

- **Fast Turnaround:** Most applications clear within two business days.

- **Live Updates:** You’ll receive a notification once your numbers are approved.

- Label removal may take time to propagate across all networks


```
Please Note: To get started with Voice Integrity, your business must first be registered for SHAKEN/STIR, which requires a valid Employer Identification Number (EIN). However, if you're a sole proprietor or do not yet have an EIN, you can still improve your phone number reputation using the Free Caller Registry.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Will activating Voice Integrity automatically enroll my numbers in SHAKEN/STIR?**

No. SHAKEN/STIR must be fully configured on your account before you can register for Voice Integrity.

**Q: Can I register international numbers?**

At this time, only U.S. numbers are supported. We’re evaluating expansion to other regions.

**Q: Why is CNAM optional?**

SHAKEN/STIR is the core requirement for proving call authenticity. Adding a branded CNAM record is recommended to maximize trust and answer rates, but not strictly mandatory.
