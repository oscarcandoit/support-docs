# Audience targeting for LinkedIn campaigns in Ad Manager

Modified on: Mon, 29 Sep, 2025 at 7:19 AM

Audience targeting defines **who will see your LinkedIn ads**. Ad Manager gives you powerful controls to build precise audiences while keeping the setup intuitive.

This article explains **geographic targeting**, **intended audience attributes** and how **include/exclude rules with AND/OR logic** work together.

* * *

- [Best Practices](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006454-audience-targeting-for-linkedin-campaigns-in-ad-manager#Best-Practices)

* * *

## **Geographic Targeting (Mandatory)**

Every LinkedIn campaign must have at least **one geographic location** selected.

- You can **include or exclude** countries, states, regions or cities.

- Search for locations in the field and add them as chips.

- Use the dropdown next to each chip to toggle **Include** or **Exclude**.

**Tip** _:_ Start with broader geographies (e.g., country) if your audience pool is small. Narrow down only when you need more precision.

* * *

## **Intended Audiences (Optional)**

Beyond location, you can refine your targeting by selecting professional attributes. These attributes let you reach people based on their LinkedIn profiles.

### **Attribute Categories Available**

- **Company** : Industry, Company Size, Growth Lists (e.g., Fortune 500).

- **Demographics** : Age, Gender (if supported by LinkedIn).

- **Job Experience** : Job Titles, Seniority, Job Function.

- **Education** : Fields of Study, Degrees, Schools.

- **Interests & Traits** : Professional interests, behaviors.

* * *

## **Include & Exclude**

Each attribute can be **included** (target these people) or **excluded** (filter them out).

- **Include Example**: Target “Marketing Managers” in the SaaS industry.

- **Exclude Example**: Remove “Interns” or “Students” to refine your reach.


* * *

## **Attribute Groups and Logic**

We supports **up to 3 attribute groups**.

- **Inside a group** : Attributes follow **OR logic**.

  - Example: Job Title = Marketing Manager **OR** Director.
- **Between groups** : Groups follow **AND logic**.

  - Example: (Job Title = Marketing Manager OR Director) **AND** (Industry = Healthcare).

This allows you to layer multiple targeting rules without overcomplicating the setup.

* * *

## **Example: Building an Audience**

Here’s how it looks in practice:

1. **Group 1 (Include)**:

   - Job Title = “General Manager” OR “Project Manager”

   - Field of Study = “Engineering”
2. **Group 2 (Include)**:

   - School = “Harvard Business School”

   - Member Group = “Amazon AWS Architects”

Result: Ads will only reach people who match at least one attribute in Group 1 AND one attribute in Group 2.

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- **Always set location first** : campaigns cannot run without it.

- **Start broad, refine later** : if the audience is too small, delivery may suffer.

- **Avoid overusing Exclude** : it may shrink the audience pool too much.

- **Use OR within groups for flexibility** : combine similar roles, industries or skills.

- **Use AND across groups for precision** : layer role + industry + company size.

- Aim for at least **50,000+ audience size** for optimal LinkedIn delivery.
