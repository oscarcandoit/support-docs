# What is On-the-Fly Tag Creation for Email Campaigns?

Tags are powerful tools used to segment your contacts and trigger automations based on specific actions. With the new on-the-fly tag creation feature, you can now create and apply new tags directly while scheduling or sending an email campaign—without leaving the campaign flow or navigating to the Tags section first.

# Key Benefits of Creating Tags During Scheduling

Creating tags directly from the Send or Schedule screen offers a more seamless, flexible, and time-saving way to manage your email campaigns.

- No need to pre-create tags in advance, making setup faster and more intuitive.

- Streamlined campaign creation, reducing clicks and context switching.

- Save time during scheduling by eliminating extra steps.

- Easily trigger automations without worrying about missing tags.

- Ensure better segmentation, improving campaign targeting and follow-ups.


# How to Create Tags from the Send or Schedule Page

Creating tags during scheduling is simple and requires only a few quick steps.

1. Navigate to Email Marketing in your HighLevel account.

2. Create a new email campaign or open an existing one you’re preparing to send.

3. Go to the Send or Schedule screen.

4. Click on "Add Tags" and toggle it on.

5. Enable Automate if you'd like these tags to trigger automations.

6. In the tag dropdown, type the name of your new tag.

7. Click the Add button to create and immediately apply the new tag to the campaign.

# Important Notes

When you create a tag this way, it is automatically added to your overall Tags list in the CRM and becomes available for use in other campaigns and automations.

Be careful with spelling and naming consistency to avoid unintentionally creating duplicate or similarly named tags. Always double-check before finalizing.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I edit or remove a tag after I schedule my campaign?

You can edit or remove tags as long as the campaign hasn’t been sent yet. Once the campaign is sent, the tags are applied and cannot be removed automatically.

Q: Will tags created on the fly appear in my CRM tags list?

Yes. Any tag created during scheduling will be saved and visible in your CRM’s overall Tags list for future use.

Q: Do I always need to enable Automate?

Only if you want the tags to trigger specific automations. You can add tags without enabling Automate if you just want to segment your audience.

Q: Can I add multiple new tags at the same time?

Yes. You can create and apply multiple new tags before finalizing your campaign schedule.

# Next Steps

- Review your current campaigns and identify where tags could help improve segmentation and follow-ups.

- Try creating new tags during your next email campaign schedule to streamline your process.

- Set up or update automations that use these new tags to drive more personalized communication and engagement.
