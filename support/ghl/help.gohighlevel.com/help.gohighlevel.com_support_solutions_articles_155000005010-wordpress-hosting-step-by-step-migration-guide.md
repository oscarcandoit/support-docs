# WordPress Hosting: Step-by-Step Migration Guide

Modified on: Mon, 28 Apr, 2025 at 2:15 PM

Welcome! As an agency, you have access to all migration options for helping your clients bring their WordPress websites into HighLevel hosting.

Go to your WordPress Dashboard and select the site you want to migrate. Choose the option that best fits your technical comfort and client needs. You’ll see three options:

- **Download the LC Migrator Plugin (Recommended):** Easily migrate the entire site with just a few clicks.

- **Manual Migration (using All-in-One Migration Plugin):** Create a `.wpress` file and upload it to migrate your site manually.

- **Agency Assistance (for agency users only):** Fill out a simple form, and our WordPress specialists will assist you with the migration.

5. * * *



### Step 6: Start the Migration


1. After selecting the sub-account, you will be redirected back to the plugin.

2. Click **Continue**.

3. Select the destination website (e.g., _Migration Demo_).

4. Check the confirmation box that notifies you that all content on the destination WordPress site will be removed.

5. Click **Start Migration**.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045795254/original/r2fAdmAxQ9G1tmGOx6Zjm8b1c_15zeLO8A.png?1745865926)
6. * * *



### Step 7: Monitor the Migration


   - The migration process will begin and typically takes **10–15 minutes** for large sites.

   - You can cancel the migration anytime _before_ the final step by clicking **Cancel Migration** (note: cancellation is not possible at the very last step).
7. * * *



### Step 8: Migration Complete


   - Once completed, you'll see a **Migration Completed** message.

   - You can now visit the migrated website.

   - (Optional but appreciated) Please leave a review for the plugin to help us improve!![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045795255/original/6UmUmChzDxE7gL79mFSlpkRY-BQPuCTNnQ.png?1745865944)

* * *

## Option 2: **Manual Migration Made Simple (AIO File Upload)**

**Best For:** Users comfortable with .wpress exports via All-in-One Migration plugin

**Use Case:** Your client has access to a .wpress file, or you're migrating from a backup

### How to Use:

1. On the source WordPress site:

   - Install and activate the **All-in-One WP Migration plugin**.

   - Export the website to a `.wpress` file.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045795282/original/z79lV8uAIHfi7tafthpDYwPXaz291fRX1A.png?1745866002)
2. In HighLevel:

   - Navigate to the sub-account’s **WordPress tab > Import Your Existing Website**.

   - Click **Choose File** and upload the `.wpress` file (Max: 2GB).
3. Wait for the upload to complete.

4. Once done, the site will auto-deploy with all content from the exported file.


> ⚠️ This option does not support incremental updates. It overwrites the target site completely.

* * *

## Option 3: **White-Glove Migration Assistance** _(Agency-Only)_

**Best For:** Complex migrations, large sites, or hands-off experiences

**Note:** Only visible to agency owners

### How to Use:

1. In the **Import Your Existing Website** section, click **Request Help**.

2. Fill out the request form with details including:

   - Source website URL

   - Hosting provider

   - Access credentials

   - Target HighLevel sub-account

   - Desired migration deadline
3. Submit the form.

4. Our WordPress specialists will:

   - Review the request within 1 business day.

   - Reach out if additional info is required.

   - Handle the migration securely and end-to-end.
5. You’ll receive a **notification email** when the migration is complete.


> This is a white-label experience. Your clients won’t see this option or know we’re involved.
