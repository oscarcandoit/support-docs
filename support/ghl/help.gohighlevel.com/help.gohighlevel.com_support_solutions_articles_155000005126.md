## **What is the Plugin Selection Feature?**

The plugin selection feature allows users to choose from a list of popular, recommended WordPress plugins during the initial site creation process. These options are curated based on real usage patterns across HighLevel’s hosted WordPress environments, ensuring immediate relevance and value for most site builds.

This step is integrated directly into the setup wizard, allowing users to kickstart their site with trusted tools—without the hassle of post-setup plugin hunting.

## **Key Benefits of Plugin Selection**

Get a head start on customizing and optimizing your WordPress site with plugins that are both useful and reliable. This feature offers:

- **Curated plugin list** based on usage trends from real sites.

- ⚙ **Automatic installation and activation**—no manual steps required.

- **No forced installs**—you choose only what fits your needs.

- **Complete plugin control** after setup through the Plugins dashboard.

- **Faster site setup** by skipping the plugin hunt post-launch.

- **Optional selection step**—ideal for both advanced users and beginners.


## **How To Use Plugin Selection During WordPress Site Setup**

Use this step-by-step guide to take advantage of the plugin selection feature when creating a new WordPress site.

1. Go to **Sites → WordPress Dashboard** from your HighLevel account.

2. Click **Create Site** or **Complete Setup** next to the site you’re working on.

3. Advance through the setup wizard until you reach the **Popular Plugins** step.

4. Browse the list of available plugins and check the boxes for the ones you’d like to include.

5. Click **Continue** or **Finish Setup** to complete your site creation.


Once the process is complete, the selected plugins will be automatically installed and activated—saving you time and ensuring your preferred tools are ready from the start.

## **Managing Plugins After Setup**

After your site is live, you maintain full control over your plugin environment. You can manage, update, or remove plugins as needed through the WordPress dashboard.

To manage your plugins:

- Click **“Open WordPress Dashboard”** from the HighLevel **Sites** page.

- In the WordPress admin panel, go to **Plugins → Installed Plugins**.

- From here, you can:

  - **Deactivate** plugins you’re not currently using

  - **Delete** unnecessary or experimental plugins

  - **Install** additional plugins not included in the curated list

This ensures flexibility and control, even if you skipped or changed your plugin selection during setup.

* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Are any plugins installed by default?**

No. Only the plugins you choose during the setup process are installed. If you skip this step, your site will start with no additional plugins.

**Q: Can I change my plugin selection after the site is created?**

Absolutely. You can install or remove plugins at any time using the WordPress Plugins dashboard.

**Q: How are the plugin options chosen?**

The plugin list is curated based on real-world usage trends and popular demand across WordPress sites hosted through HighLevel.

**Q: What if the plugin I want isn’t listed?**

You can always install any additional plugin manually after setup using the standard WordPress plugin search and upload features.

**Q: Is the plugin selection step required?**

No. This step is completely optional. You can skip it and still complete your site setup with a clean installation.

### **Next Steps**

- After setup, explore your WordPress Dashboard and configure any installed plugins to match your site’s goals.
