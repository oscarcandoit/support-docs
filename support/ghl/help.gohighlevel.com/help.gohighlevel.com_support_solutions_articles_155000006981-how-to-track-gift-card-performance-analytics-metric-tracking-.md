# How to Track Gift Card Performance (Analytics & Metric Tracking)

Modified on: Thu, 20 Nov, 2025 at 5:44 AM

The Gift Card Dashboard provides a consolidated view of how your gift card program is performing over time. This includes issuance counts, revenue impact, buyer trends, and denomination preferences. You’ll find this under **Payments → Gift Cards → Top Dashboard** after at least one gift card has been sold or sent.

This view changes based on the filters available on the top left corner, with 'This Month' as the default, of the Gift Cards landing page and remains as a consistent section irrespective of whether user is viewing the Gift Card Products page or All Orders page.

## **1\. Total Gift Cards Issued**

Shows the total number of gift cards created within the selected time period, combining both:

- Cards sold through any checkout, and

- Cards sent directly through the Send flow

Use this metric to understand overall adoption and utilization.

## **2\. Total Value of Gift Cards Issued**

Displays the total monetary value of all issued gift cards.

A trend chart shows value changes over time—helpful for spotting seasonal peaks or campaign-driven spikes.

_Example:_

If five ₹500 cards and two ₹2,000 cards were issued in a week, the total value reflects ₹6,500.

## **3\. Average Order Value (AOV)**

This helps identify whether customers gravitate toward smaller or larger denominations.
