# **Overview**

The **Send** feature allows businesses to issue fully valid gift cards to customers instantly or on a schedule—without taking any payment.

Each card sent creates a **Gift Card Order** and includes recipient information, expiry, balance, and delivery details.

You can send gift cards:

- As a reward

- As a gesture of goodwill

- As compensation

- For testing or debugging teams

- As part of internal promotions

- To influencers, partners, or VIP customers


Gift Cards sent through the Send flow function exactly like purchased gift cards—they are redeemable at all supported checkouts.

* * *

# **Use Cases for Sending Gift Cards**

Sending Gift Cards manually is ideal for:

### **⭐ Loyalty & Rewards**

Reward customers for milestones, referrals, or premium plan renewals.

### **⭐ Customer Support Compensation**

Issue a gift card instead of a manual credit or refund.

### **⭐ Promotions**

Run giveaways, holiday gifting, influencer campaigns, or targeted perks.

### **⭐ Internal Testing**

QA teams, admins, or developers can test redemption flows.

### **⭐ Bulk Manual Distribution**

Gift VIP customers or event attendees a prepaid balance.

* * *

# **Prerequisites**

Before sending a gift card, ensure:

1. A **Gift Card Product** exists

2. The Gift Card Product is **Active** (not Deactivated or Archived)

3. The customer receiving the card has either:

   - An **email address**, or
