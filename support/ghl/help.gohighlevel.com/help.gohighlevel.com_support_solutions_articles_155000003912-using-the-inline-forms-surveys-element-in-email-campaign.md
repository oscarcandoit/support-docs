### **What Are Forms/ Surveys Elements?**

The Forms/ Surveys Element allows you to add pre-built or custom feedback forms (1-10 scoring, like/dislike, 5 stars, etc.). It helps collect and analyze responses via the **Submissions** tab under campaign statistics.

### **When to Use It:**

1. Collect product feedback (1-10 scale).
2. Gather service reviews (5-star ratings).
3. Use Like/Dislike forms for simple feedback.
4. Export data for users with low ratings.

### **How to Use:**

1. Go to **Email Marketing** and create a new campaign.
2. Add the **Form Element**.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034970390/original/4C8mRL75t0O9jSqtlDD1Cnko2MBKLcBUlA.png?1729255042)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:Do I need a custom success URL for form responses to be tracked in email campaigns?**

No. Form submissions including ratings, Like/Dislike, and scoring are tracked as soon as a contact clicks on the element inside the email.

A custom success URL is completely optional. It’s only used to control where the user is redirected after clicking (for example, to a thank-you page or external link).

Even if you don’t set a redirect, the submission will still appear in your campaign statistics under the Submissions tab. To identify each form’s response clearly, be sure to give your form a unique title during setup.
