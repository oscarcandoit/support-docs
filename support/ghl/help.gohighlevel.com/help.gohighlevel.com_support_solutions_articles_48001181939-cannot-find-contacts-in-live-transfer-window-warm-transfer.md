# Cannot find contacts in live transfer window - warm transfer

The transfer won't give you a list of contacts. The idea is that an agent is on a call with the customer already and he wants to transfer the call to his colleague.

So, for both transfers we are showing the users and the forwarding numbers from Settings->Team management.

If you only have one User:

It won't show a list of contacts (these need to be dialled), it shows the users like the test here:
