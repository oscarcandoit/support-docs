# Why doesn’t my Business Name display after CNAM registration?

Modified on: Mon, 25 Aug, 2025 at 10:42 AM

### **What is CNAM?**

CNAM (Caller ID Name), short for **Caller Name Presentation**, is a legacy technology from the 1990s that allows the display of a caller’s name, whether personal or business, alongside their phone number.

For example, instead of your customers seeing only `+1 (555) XXX-4XX7`, they might see **“XYZ Company”**, which helps establish trust and increases the likelihood of the call being answered.

While CNAM doesn’t prevent nuisance or spam labeling, it provides more accurate caller information and can positively impact answer rates when used correctly.

* * *

### **How CNAM Works**

When you place an outbound call, only your phone number is transmitted. The receiving carrier then performs a lookup in one of several decentralized CNAM databases to match your number with a name and display it on the recipient’s device.

However, because these databases are fragmented and managed independently, data inconsistencies and coverage gaps often occur. This is one of the biggest challenges with CNAM reliability today.

* * *

**Onboarding for CNAM**

Getting started is simple:

1. Go to **Settings > Phone Numbers > Trust Center > CNAM (Voice)**

2. Start the registration process

* * *

**Prerequisites for CNAM**

Any entity with a valid **business registration number** may sign up for CNAM , including:

- Sole proprietors

- Registered brands


**Important:****Any entity with a business registration number—including sole proprietors with an EIN—may sign up for CNAM. An EIN is mandatory, whether you’re a one-person operation or a larger, registered brand.**

* * *

### **Where is CNAM Supported?**

Currently, CNAM is supported **only in the United States**.

That said, CNAM coverage in the U.S. is still limited, working reliably in less than **20% of cases**. This is why some customers may not always see your business name displayed.

* * *

**Why Doesn’t CNAM Work All the Time?**

CNAM faces several challenges:

- **Data inconsistencies**: Carriers pull data from one of 8 different CNAM databases, often choosing the cheapest option. This creates reliability issues such as outdated or incorrect data being displayed.

- **Limited consumer reach**: CNAM is widely bundled with landline services, but for mobile phones, it’s often a **premium feature**. Since most mobile devices already display the contact name saved in the phone, adoption is limited. As a result, CNAM penetration is less than **20% among mobile users**.

- Not all carriers support CNAM. Even if they do, the recipient must have a **carrier plan that includes CNAM lookup** (it’s often a paid or premium feature, especially on mobile).

* * *

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q.****How reliable is CNAM today?**

CNAM coverage is currently limited—working reliably in less than **20% of U.S. cases**. This means many recipients may only see your phone number, not your registered name.

**Q. Does CNAM work on mobile phones?**

Not consistently. CNAM is more common on landlines, while on mobile phones it is often a premium feature. Since most mobile users already see names from their contact list, CNAM adoption among mobile carriers is low.

**Q. Can CNAM prevent my calls from being marked as spam or nuisance?**

No. CNAM only displays your business or personal name. It does not control or influence whether your number gets flagged as spam.
