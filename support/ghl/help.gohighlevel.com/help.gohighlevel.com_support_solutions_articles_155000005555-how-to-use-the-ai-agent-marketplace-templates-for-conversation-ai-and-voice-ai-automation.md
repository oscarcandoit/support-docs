Learn how to navigate, publish, and install AI agent templates for both chat and voice automation using HighLevel’s AI Agent Marketplace. This guide covers visibility settings, agent packaging, installation steps, and reuse options. Whether you’re building bots or managing sub-accounts, you’ll find everything you need to deploy and control automation efficiently.

# **What is the AI Agent Marketplace for Conversation AI and Voice AI ?**

The AI Agent Marketplace is a built-in feature in HighLevel that allows you to publish, browse, and install prebuilt AI agent templates designed for chat and voice automation. These templates are built for use with **Conversation AI** (for messaging channels) and **Voice AI** (for phone calls), and come fully packaged with workflows, calendars, custom fields, and other assets required for smooth execution. Agency owners and admins can create and list agents for others to use, while sub-accounts can install only those that are approved for them. Whether you’re aiming to automate lead qualification, appointment booking, or customer engagement, the Marketplace provides a scalable, ready-to-use solution—eliminating the need to start from scratch.

## **Key Benefits of Using the AI Agent Marketplace Templates**

AI agent templates in the Marketplace are designed to reduce setup time, simplify team collaboration, and scale automation effortlessly across chat and voice channels. Instead of building every workflow from scratch, you can install tested, ready-to-deploy templates that deliver immediate functionality.

- **Accelerated Automation**: Deploy fully functional chat or voice experiences in minutes using expert-built templates.

- **Earn from Your Expertise**: Package and list your best-performing agents as templates others can discover and purchase.

- **Try Before You Install**: Preview Conversation AI templates in real time through a built-in chat widget to validate their performance.

- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Decide which templates your sub-accounts can see or use, keeping implementation aligned with your agency’s strategy.

- **Easy Replication**: Reuse installed templates across clients or departments without repeating setup work.
