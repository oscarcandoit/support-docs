### Why This Playbook Matters

You’re an expert in guiding borrowers, structuring deals, and closing loans—but how do you keep a consistent flow of inbound leads, nurture relationships, and grow your business predictably?

Most mortgage brokers still rely heavily on agent referrals or past clients, but here’s the reality:

- **88% of borrowers start their home loan journey online.**

- **78% of prospects go with the first broker or lender who responds.**

- **61% of homebuyers say slow communication is the #1 reason they don't work with a broker.**


If you're not showing up on Google, following up fast, or staying top-of-mind with digital marketing—your competition is winning the loans you should be closing.

This playbook gives you a **step-by-step system** to launch and grow your brokerage with **HighLevel**—so you attract, convert, and retain more borrowers.

### What You’ll Learn

✅ The 5 fastest ways to attract high-quality mortgage leads

* * *

## Step 1: Get Found Online by Pre-Approved Borrowers

### Why This Matters

The vast majority of borrowers start their research on **Google**—not by calling a broker. You need to **rank high**, show up consistently, and look credible.

* * *

### What To Do First:

✅ **Claim & Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP)**

List your NMLS ID, brokerage details, service areas, and loan types (FHA, VA, Conventional, Jumbo).

[How to Set Up Google Business Profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177?hl=en)

✅ **Add a HighLevel Call Tracking Number**

Replace your phone number with a HighLevel tracking line to measure ROI on leads from Google, ads, or referrals.

[How to Set Up a Call Tracking Number](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001179764-call-tracking-and-missed-call-text-back-through-google-business-profile)

✅ **Enable Google Messaging + AI Follow-Up**

Let potential borrowers text you directly from Google—and use HighLevel to respond automatically.

✅ **Collect & Automate Google Reviews**

Brokers with 50+ reviews get **3x more local traffic** and convert better.

[How to Automate Google Reviews](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003873-how-to-setup-workflow-triggers-for-google-and-facebook-reviews)

✅ **Post Weekly Google Updates**

Keep your Google listing fresh with mortgage tips, rate updates, or milestone announcements (e.g., "5 First-Time Buyers Closed This Month").

[How to Optimize Your Google Business Profile](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222899-how-to-integrate-your-google-business-profile-formerly-gmb-into-the-crm)

* * *

## Step 2: Automate Lead Follow-Up Before You Lose the Deal

### Why This Matters

**Speed to lead = deal closed.**

If you're not following up in under 5 minutes, someone else is—and they're getting your commission.

* * *

### What To Do First:

✅ **Add a Chat Widget to Your Website**

Turn your site into a lead magnet—let visitors text you instead of ghosting.

[How to Set Up Chat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)

✅ **Enable Missed Call Text-Back**

Missed a call from a hot lead? HighLevel sends a text back instantly so you don’t lose them.

#### [Setting up Missed Call Text Back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001239140-where-and-how-to-configure-the-missed-call-text-back-feature)

✅ **Automate Follow-Up Campaigns**

Set up lead nurture emails and SMS:

- “Thanks for reaching out—here’s what you need to know before applying.”

- “Still exploring home loans? Let’s schedule a call.”


✅ **Add a Consultation Booking Link**

Let clients schedule calls with you without going back and forth.

[Setting Up Recurring Follow Ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003450-recurring-appointments)

✅ **Use Conversation AI & Voice AI**

Automate responses to FAQs like “What’s the current rate?” or “Can I qualify with a 620 score?”

[How to Set Up Conversation AI Agent](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000210-how-to-use-conversation-ai-to-book-appointments)

* * *

## Step 3: Turn Happy Clients Into 5-Star Reviews

### Why This Matters

Borrowers trust other borrowers. More 5-star reviews = more applications.

- Brokers with 40+ recent reviews close **38% more deals**

- A single positive review can generate **3+ referral leads**


* * *

### What To Do First:

✅ **Enable Automated Review Requests**

After closing, trigger review requests via email and SMS.

✅ **Request on Google, Zillow, and Facebook**

Maximize visibility where borrowers compare brokers.

✅ **Respond to Reviews Publicly**

It boosts Google trust and shows professionalism.

✅ **Flag Negative Feedback Immediately**

Set up alerts so you can respond to unhappy clients before it hurts your brand.

✅ **Repurpose Reviews on Social**

Turn positive testimonials into Instagram posts or Stories:

_“Just helped a first-time buyer get approved in 7 days! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐”_

**[How to Automate Reviews & Reputation Management](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001074-maximizing-customer-engagement-with-reviews-ai-a-guide-to-suggestive-and-auto-pilot-modes)**

* * *

## Step 4: Launch High-Intent Ads Without Wasting Budget

### Why This Matters

Lead quality > lead quantity.

Smart brokers use targeted ads to attract borrowers actively researching loans.

### What To Do First:

✅ **Set Up Google Search Ads for Loan Keywords**

Target buyers searching:

- “Best mortgage broker near me”


✅ **Use Facebook Lead Ads for Refinance & FHA**

Generate low-CPC leads for specific loan types or refi opportunities.

✅ **Track Calls, Forms, & ROI**

**[How to Run Ads That Converts](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002433-overview-of-ad-manager)**

✅ **Start Small, Then Scale**

Begin with $15–25/day targeting a specific persona (e.g., first-time buyers, VA borrowers), then grow based on performance.

* * *

## Step 5: Build Authority with Weekly Content & Social Proof

### Why This Matters

Borrowers don’t trust silence. Showing up consistently on social builds brand trust and brings in referrals.

[How to Share your reviews on Social Media](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001620-share-your-reviews-as-posts-on-social-media-using-social-planner)
