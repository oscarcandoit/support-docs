# Knowledge Base - Document & Rich-Text Support

Modified on: Thu, 30 Oct, 2025 at 8:57 AM

Quickly transform existing Word docs, PDFs, and rich‑text notes into AI‑ready knowledge for your HighLevel agents. Upload documents or write directly in a rich‑text editor to centralize information faster and reduce manual copy‑paste. Automatic parsing structures content into searchable chunks so agents retrieve accurate answers. Ideal for teams consolidating SOPs, product docs, and support playbooks.

* * *

# **What is Document Support for Knowledge Base?**

Document Support adds two ways to populate a HighLevel Knowledge Base: upload document files (DOC, DOCX, PDF) and create/edit content directly in a built‑in rich‑text editor. During ingestion, HighLevel extracts headings and text so AI agents can find and cite exactly the right passages.

HighLevel’s Knowledge Base can now ingest content from common document formats and rich text. The system automatically parses documents into structured sections, which improves answer quality and reduces manual formatting work.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Document Support for Knowledge Base**

Understanding the advantages helps you decide when to upload a file versus writing in the editor. These benefits focus on speed, accuracy, and maintainability so teams can ship updates with confidence.

- **Broader formats:** Accept industry‑standard file types (DOC, DOCX, PDF) so you can reuse content you already maintain.

- **Time savings:** Ingest entire documents in one step instead of copying and pasting sections.

- **Inline editing:** Use the rich‑text editor to make quick content updates or create net‑new entries without leaving HighLevel.

- **Higher answer quality:** Automatic parsing structures content into searchable chunks aligned with headings and sections.

- **Works with existing sources:** Combine documents and rich text with URLs and FAQs to strengthen your training data.

* * *

## **Supported File Types & Ingestion Behavior**

Know what content is extracted and how it is handled so you can prepare documents that ingest cleanly and provide high‑quality answers.

```
Note: Before uploading, remove sensitive content and ensure headings accurately reflect your structure. Clear headings produce better chunks and better answers.
```

- **Supported types:** DOC, DOCX, PDF.

- **Text‑only ingestion:** Text is ingested. Embedded images are skipped to keep knowledge lightweight and focused on searchable content.

- **Heading awareness:** Detected heading hierarchy (for example, H1–H4) improves chunking and retrieval relevance.

- **Instant indexing:** New content becomes available immediately or within about a minute, depending on file size and indexing.

* * *

## **Automatic Parsing & Structuring**

Parsing converts long documents into manageable chunks that align with sections and headings, enabling precise retrieval and citations in agent responses.

- Extracts text and detects headings to form a logical hierarchy.

- Splits large files into optimized chunks for faster, more relevant search.

- Indexes the content upon completion so bots can use the latest information.

- Preserves document‑level context so related sections remain connected during retrieval.

# **How To Upload & Use Documents in Knowledge Base**

Proper setup ensures documents entries ingest cleanly and become searchable quickly for your AI agents.

01. Go to **AI Agents** from your sub-account **.**

02. Click on the **Knowledge Base** tab.

08. Once the parsing is complete, the status will turn to **Processed**.

09. You can use the **arrow icon** to **open** the uploaded **file** in a **new** **tab** or click on the **bin icon** to **delete** it as well.

10. You can also add **Rich‑Text** to **write** or **edit** content directly in the editor.

11. Click **Save** to add the Rich-text to the knowledge base.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do images inside my Word or PDF import?**

Only text is ingested. Images are skipped to keep knowledge lightweight and searchable.

**Q: How fast do new uploads become available to agents?**

Content is available immediately or within about a minute, depending on file size and indexing.

**Q: Can I upload Google Docs directly?**

Export your Google Doc as .DOCX or .PDF, then upload the exported file.

**Q: Will rich‑text edits overwrite my uploaded files?**

No. File‑based sources and rich‑text entries are stored separately, preserving both versions.

**Q: Does Document Support replace URL or FAQ sources?**

No. Documents and rich text complement URLs and FAQs, giving your bot deeper, more reliable training data.

**Q: Will document uploads overwrite existing Knowledge Base entries?**

No. Each upload is added as a new source. You can keep file‑based sources and rich‑text entries alongside URLs and FAQs.
