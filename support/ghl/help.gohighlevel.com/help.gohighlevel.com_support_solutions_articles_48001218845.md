# **Troubleshooting**

### **What is the maximum MMS size when sending SMS?**

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Carrier** | **Long code MMS attachment size** | **Toll-Free MMS attachment size** | **Shortcode MMS attachment size** |
| AT&T | 0.6 MB | 0.6 MB | 0.6 MB |
| Sprint | 1.4 MB | 0.6 MB | 1.4 MB |
| T-mobile | 1.5 MB | 0.6 MB | 1.0 MB |
| Verizon | 0.675 MB | 0.6 MB | 1.2 MB |

### **What are the support file types for MMS when sending via SMS?**

- png
- gif

### **My custom value does not work when the message is sent?**

Please double-check to make sure:

1. There are no spaces in your custom value URL, you can test this by adding it to a dummy funnel and previewing the page. If the MMS appears the custom value works, please proceed to the next step below
2. The MMS URL meets the size requirement for the provided carrier (see question above)
