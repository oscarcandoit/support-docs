# **What is One-Click Upsell in Memberships?**

A one-click upsell is a post-purchase offer that appears immediately after a customer buys a product. Instead of going through another full checkout process, customers can accept the additional offer with just a single click, and the same payment method is used automatically. This technique helps businesses increase order value without adding friction to the buying process. It’s especially useful for selling related digital products, bonuses, or access to premium content.

## **Key Benefits of One-Click Upsell**

- Increase order value without extra marketing effort
- Present highly relevant offers right after purchase
- Simplify the experience with no additional checkout steps
- Customize upsell pages to match your branding
- Automate upsell delivery and track results with analytics

**Open the Upsell Tab**

The Upsell tab is where you can manage all upsell offers associated with a specific product. This is the starting point for adding additional offers to increase the value of your initial sale and streamline the purchase process for your customers.

**Choose “One-Click Upsell”**

In the upsell type selection modal that appears, choose the **One-Click Upsell** option. This type of upsell lets customers purchase an additional offer right after their initial purchase with a single click. After selecting it, click **Continue** to move forward.

**Customize the Upsell Page**

Once your upsell is added, you’ll be taken to the customization screen. The built-in editor offers full control over visuals, messaging, and layout through three key tabs: Details, Body, and Checkout. Below is a breakdown of each customization area.

Make sure to click **Save** after making changes and toggle the status to **Active** when ready to publish.

**Details Tab**

This section controls the textual content and layout of your upsell headline and subheading.

- **Title Content**: Set the main headline for your upsell page. This is typically the name of the offer or a strong callout (e.g., “Unlock VIP Access”).
- **Font & Size**: Choose the font family and font size for the title text.
- **Text Color**: Set a custom color for your title to match your brand.
- **Alignment**: Choose whether the title appears left-aligned, centered, or right-aligned.
- **Subtitle Content**: Add supporting text beneath your headline for context or emphasis.
- **Subtitle Font & Size**: Set the subtitle font style and size to match or contrast with your title.
- **Background Style**: Select from predefined background options (like solid colors or no background) for the top section of your page.

**Body Tab**

The Body tab allows you to add engaging visuals that help sell the upsell product.

- **Add Video**: Upload or embed a promotional video for your upsell product. This is a great way to explain the offer visually and drive conversions.
- **Poster Image**: Upload a static image that displays as a preview thumbnail before the video plays (ideal dimensions: 1280x720). This image also serves as a fallback if the video is not played.
- **Reset to Default**: Quickly revert the section back to its original default layout and visuals.

**Checkout Tab**

This section controls the buttons and price styling on your upsell page, giving you complete control over the call-to-action elements.

- **Purchase Button Content**: Edit the label on the primary CTA (e.g., “Buy Now,” “Add to My Order”).
- **Background Color**: Choose a custom background color for the button to make it pop.
- **Purchase Button Font**: Customize the font type, size, and text color.
- **Cancel Button Content**: Edit the text that appears as the secondary option (e.g., “No thanks, take me to my purchase”).
- **Cancel Button Font**: Adjust the font and color for this button to de-emphasize it.
- **Price Font & Style**: Choose how the price is displayed, including font family, size, and text color.
- **Price Background**: Customize the background of the pricing section to further match your branding.

**Preview and Activate**

Once your upsell page is fully customized, you can save changes, preview the final experience, and activate the upsell offer for live use. These controls are located in the top-right corner of the editor.

- **Save**: Click the **Save** button to apply any edits or customizations you’ve made to the upsell page. Saving ensures that your changes are preserved before activating the offer.
- **Preview**: Use the **Preview** option to view the upsell experience exactly as your customers will see it. This is helpful for reviewing layout, messaging, and checkout flow before publishing.
- **Activate/Deactivate Toggle**: The dropdown that says **Inactive** allows you to change the upsell’s status. Select **Active** to make the upsell live and available to customers during the checkout process. You can also toggle it back to **Inactive** if you want to pause the upsell offer without deleting it.

**Remove or Edit as Needed**

To remove or edit an upsell, navigate back to the Upsell tab within your Offer. Click the three-dot menu next to the upsell name and select **Delete** to remove it. If you want to make changes, simply click the upsell name to edit its details or swap it with a different offer.
