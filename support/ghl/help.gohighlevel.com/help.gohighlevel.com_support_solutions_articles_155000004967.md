# **What are Geographic Site Analytics (Country, State & City Drilldown)?**

Geographic Analytics is an interactive heat-map that visualizes web traffic all the way from country to state to city level. By drilling down, you can identify high-interest pockets within a region, compare performance across different local markets, and fine-tune your marketing strategy in real time. Both map and ranked list update the moment you change the dropdown, no manual reload required. This experience allows you to identify high-traffic regions and evaluate international audience engagement across your digital assets.

## **Key Benefits of Geographic Analytics**

Understanding your traffic sources by geography can help refine your marketing strategies, improve localization efforts, and monitor performance across international campaigns.

- **Global Heatmap View** – Visualize traffic distribution across countries instantly.

- **Traffic Trend Identification** – Detect shifts in audience behavior based on geographic location.

- **Audience Targeting** – Focus outreach and paid campaigns on top-performing regions.

- **Top Country Breakdown** – Access a ranked list of the ten countries, states or cities driving the most visits.

- **Anomaly Detection** – Identify unexpected spikes in visits from unfamiliar regions.

- **Market Insights** – Use location data to evaluate expansion opportunities or content localization needs.

## **Understanding the Dynamic Heat Map**

The heat map provides geographic context to your site traffic.  **Colors on the map deepen as traffic increases**, giving you a quick visual cue of hotspots without digging through spreadsheets.

Move your cursor across the map to **reveal precise visitor numbers for country each state or city**. Tooltips appear immediately, saving you from scrolling the side list when you need a quick figure.

## **Total Visitors and Ranked Lists**

Each drill-down level includes a side-panel list that automatically ranks the top regions by visit count. The list updates in real time as you change levels, making it effortless to spot your highest-traffic areas at a glance.

A running total of all visits for the selected drill-down level stays visible above the map. As you move from country to state to city, the total refreshes automatically so you always know the full audience size you’re analyzing.

## **Geographic Dropdown (Country, State, City)**

**Switch between Country, State, and City** with a single selector to instantly change the heat-map and ranked list. This dropdown removes extra clicks and keeps your workflow focused on insight rather than navigation. The dynamic heat map will update in real-time as you use the geographic dropdown.
