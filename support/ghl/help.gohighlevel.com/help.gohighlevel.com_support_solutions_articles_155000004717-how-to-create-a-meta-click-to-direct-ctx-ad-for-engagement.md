# **How to Create a Meta Ad for Engagement with Messaging Apps as the Conversion Location**

Meta Ads allow businesses to drive engagement and start conversations with potential customers through messaging apps like **Facebook Messenger, Instagram Direct, and WhatsApp**. This guide will walk you through setting up an ad campaign with the following specifications:

- **Ad Objective:** Engagement
- **Conversion Location:** Messaging Apps
- **Performance Goal:** Maximise the number of conversations

Additionally, this guide highlights the **exceptions** where the ad or conversation form may work for one messaging app but not for others.

* * *

## **Step 1: Access Ad Manager**

1. Go to sub-account > Marketing > **Ad Manager** provided your onboarding is completed. (Refer [link](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004261-how-to-enable-and-resell-ad-manager) on how to enable and resell ad manager)
2. Click on **\+ Create Campaign** to start a new campaign.

3. Select Facebook Campaign and Start from scratch.

* * *

## **Step 2: Choose the Facebook page and Instagram account**

1. Select the Facebook page you want your ad to associate with and reflect your business.
2. Either select an Instagram account that's connected to the selected FB page or use the Facebook page itself to showcase your ad on Instagram. Details on how to connect an Instagram account with the FB page and other important info is listed in the following [help article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004550-instagram-ads-overview).

```
Note: Instagram messaging app will not be eligible for Click to Direct ads if there is no Insta account connected to the selected page.
```

* * *

## **Step 3: Choose the Ad Objective**

1. Select **Engagement** as the objective.

2. The **Conversion Location** is defaulted to be **'** **Messaging Apps'**.

3. The **Performance goal** is defaulted to be **'Maximise number of conversations'**.
   - This ensures Meta optimises ad delivery to encourage users to start chats with your business.

* * *

## **Step 4: Choose Messaging Apps for Conversations**

Under the **Messaging Apps** section, select one or more platforms where you want to receive messages:

- **Facebook Messenger**
- **Instagram Direct -** It will be active to be used only if the selected Facebook page has an Instagram account connected to it.
- **WhatsApp -** The WhatsApp can be used as a messaging app for a CTX ad only if you have WhatsApp numbers added to the Facebook page that's selected for the ad campaign.

### **What If a Messaging App is not selected?**

| Scenario | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| **All three apps are available (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp)** | The ad is shown across all platforms, and Meta algorithm decides which is the best app to reach the user. |
| **Only Messenger and Instagram Direct are available** | WhatsApp is not an option. Users can message you via Messenger or Instagram Direct. |
| **Only WhatsApp is available** | Users will be directed only to WhatsApp for conversations. The ad won't run on Messenger or Instagram. |
| **Only one app is available** | The ad campaign will be shown across all platforms but user is limited to reach you only via that messaging platform. |
| **None of the messaging apps are available** | The ad cannot be created under this objective. You may need to choose another objective (e.g., Traffic or Leads). |

* * *

## **Step 5: Create or Use a Conversation form**

The details on how to create or use an already created conversation form are explained in detail in this [help article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004718-how-to-create-a-conversation-form-in-ad-manager).

* * *

## **Step 6: Select Placements**

- **Automatic Placements (Recommended)**: Meta will distribute the ad where it’s most likely to generate conversations.
- **Manual Placements**: You can select specific placements such as Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Stories, etc.

* * *

## **Step 7: Create Your Ad**

1. **Select an Ad Format**:
   - **Single Image/Video** – A simple ad with one visual.
   - **Carousel** – Multiple images/videos users can scroll through.
2. **Write Engaging Ad Copy**:
   - Keep it short and compelling.
   - Highlight a strong **Call-to-Action (CTA)** like "Message Us Now!".
3. **Set Up the Call-to-Action (CTA)**:
   - Choose "Send Message".
   - If multiple messaging apps are selected, Meta will optimise the best platform to message you where you're most likely to respond.

* * *

## **Step 8: Budget & Schedule**

1. Set a **Daily Budget** or **Lifetime Budget**.
2. Choose a start and end date if needed.
3. Ensure your budget aligns with your campaign goals.

* * *

## **Step 9: Set Up the Audience**

1. Choose your audience based on location, age, gender, and detailed targeting.
2. Use **Custom Audiences** to target existing customers or lookalike audiences to find new users.

* * *

## **Step 10: Review and Publish**

1. Double-check all settings.
2. Click **Publish** to launch your ad.
3. Monitor performance in **Ad Manager Statistics.**

* * *

# **Tracking & Optimisation**

- Use **Meta Pixel** to track user interactions.
- Create a CAPI action to send back details to Meta for effective tracking of conversations.


- Optimise by testing different creatives and audience segments.
- Adjust budget and placements based on performance metrics.
