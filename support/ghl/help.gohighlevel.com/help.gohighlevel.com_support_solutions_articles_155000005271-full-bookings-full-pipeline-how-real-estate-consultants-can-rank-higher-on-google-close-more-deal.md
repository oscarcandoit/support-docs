### Are You Losing Leads to Local Competitors?

You're great at helping clients buy, sell, and invest in real estate — but if you're not showing up in search results, you're missing out on qualified leads ready to act now.

**Top Real Estate Challenges We See:**

- You rely on referrals but aren’t consistently getting new calls

- You're spending on Zillow or Google Ads, but it’s hard to track what’s working

- Inquiries go cold before you can respond

- Your competitors are showing up higher on Google and winning listings that should be yours


### Industry Reality:

✅ 97% of home buyers begin their search online

✅ 70% of sellers contact the first consultant they find online

✅ Consultants with 50+ Google reviews get 2X more inbound requests than those without

If your real estate business isn't optimized for search, you're leaving listings — and revenue — on the table.

```
Sign up for HighLevel & take your Real Estate Consultant business to the next level.
```

* * *

### What If Getting More Listings Was Effortless?

Imagine a system that:

✅ Gets your business listed in the Google “Map Pack”

✅ Attracts motivated sellers and high-intent buyers

✅ Automates follow-ups and lead nurturing while you’re showing homes

✅ Tracks where every deal came from (Google? Ads? Website?)

This playbook shows you **exactly how to rank higher**, capture better leads, and automate the follow-through.

* * *

### Here’s What You’ll Learn:

✅ How to optimize your Google Business Profile to dominate real estate searches

✅ How to improve your website SEO & convert leads from site visits

✅ How to use HighLevel’s AI & automation to follow up instantly

✅ How to track every call & consult

✅ How to prep for running high-ROI ads once your organic visibility is strong

* * *

## Step 1: Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP) for Local Search

### Why It Matters

When sellers Google “real estate consultant in \[City\]” — your **Google Business Profile** is the first thing they see. Consultants who optimize their GBP show up in the top 3 map results and win more listings.

**Real Use Case:**

A boutique consultant in Dallas went from 4 inbound leads/month to 20+ by optimizing GBP, enabling review automation, and posting weekly updates.

* * *

### 1.1 Claim & Complete Your GBP

- ✅ Ensure your name, address, phone number (NAP) match your website

- ✅ Add detailed service areas: "Luxury homes in Frisco", "Downtown Dallas condos", etc.

- ✅ List services: Buyer Consults, Home Evaluations, Listing Prep, Investment Consulting

- ✅ Upload team photos, office images, and success story graphics

### 1.2 Enable Messaging & Call Tracking

- ✅ Allow messaging directly from Google via HighLevel

- ✅ Replace your GBP number with a HighLevel tracking number

- ✅ Route all leads into your CRM for follow-up

* * *

## Step 2: Improve Your Website for Local SEO & Lead Capture

### Why It Matters

Your site must not only rank — it must **convert traffic into conversations and consults**. Mobile load time, clear offers, and smart follow-up are everything.

[Sites Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001633)

* * *

### 2.1 Optimize for “Near Me” & ZIP-Based Searches

- ✅ Use local keywords on:

• Homepage: “Top Real Estate Consultant in \[City\]”

• Service Pages: “Seller Consulting in \[ZIP\]”

• Footer: List every ZIP/neighborhood you serve

- ✅ Create blog content that answers common questions:

“When’s the best time to sell in \[City\]?”

“How to price your home in \[ZIP\]?”


#### [How to Optimize for SEO Meta Data](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000980312)

* * *

## Step 3: Get High-Quality Local Backlinks

### Why It Matters

Backlinks tell Google that your site is trusted and local. The more respected sites linking to you, the better you’ll rank.

* * *

### 3.1 Submit to Local & Industry Directories

- ✅ Realtor.com, Zillow, Trulia

- ✅ Local chamber of commerce

- ✅ Mortgage broker, staging company, or interior designer partner sites


* * *

### 3.2 Write Guest Posts & Get Referenced

- ✅ Blog post examples:

• “5 Neighborhoods to Watch in \[City\] in 2024”

• “What Sellers Need to Know Before Pricing Their Home”

- ✅ Link each post to a landing page with a HighLevel booking form

- ✅ Track traffic from guest blogs via source tags in HighLevel

#### [How to Set Up Lead Capture Forms That Convert](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004549-how-to-create-a-contact-form-in-highlevel-)

* * *

## Step 4: Track What’s Working (and Scale It)

### Why It Matters

Consultants who don’t track conversions don’t scale. Attribution = growth. Know what’s driving consults, and double down.

* * *

### 4.1 Use HighLevel to Track:

| Metric | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| Calls from Google | Show your GBP impact |
| Lead Source Attribution | Know which blog, ad, or funnel converts |
| Page-to-Booking Conversion | Optimize high-performing pages |
| Review Growth | Influence local search rank |
| Missed Call Text Back Rate | Save leads you’d otherwise lose |

* * *

**Real Consultant Case Study:**

A San Antonio real estate consultant using HighLevel tracked Google calls vs. social traffic. Google outperformed Facebook 3-to-1 in booked consults. By doubling down on GBP optimization and reviews, they increased booked seller appointments by 180% in 90 days.

✅ Rank in the top 3 for searches in your city
