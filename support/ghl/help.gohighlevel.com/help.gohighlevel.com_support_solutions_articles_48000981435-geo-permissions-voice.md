# Geo Permissions - Voice

Modified on: Fri, 29 Aug, 2025 at 7:37 AM

**Overview**

At HighLevel, protecting our customers from fraud while ensuring a smooth experience is our top priority. Recently, you may have noticed that calling in some countries requires additional setup. Here’s why this is happening, and how we’re working to make it seamless for you.

## **The Challenge: Fraudulent Calls Driving Up Costs**

Fraudulent calls are a major problem across the telecom industry. Hackers sometimes gain access to accounts and make thousands of calls to high-risk countries, leading to:

- Unexpected spikes in your bills

- Service interruptions

- Wasted resources for your business


To reduce fraud, we’ve changed how **GEO Permissions** (the ability to call specific countries) work. This means calls can only be made to the countries you truly need, rather than leaving global access open to attackers.

* * *

## **Countries enabled ( For voice on LC )-**

Below are the countries enabled for you-

- **US and Canada** are enabled for everyone.

- **Your business’s home country** (from your business profile), unless it is flagged as high-risk
- **Any country where you have purchased a phone number** (for example, if you are in South Africa but also have a UK number, both will be enabled)

This ensures that the countries you actually operate in are available from day one, without needing to contact support.

**Note- 1.This applies only to voice calling. SMS does not support automatic country enablement.**

**2.** ****All other country permissions must be managed at the customer’s sub-account level.****

* * *

**How to make changes to geo permissions if i am using LC?**

If you need changes made to your GEO Permissions (for example, to enable or disable specific countries), please provide the following details in our support chat so we can escalate your request to the LC Phone team:

- **Location ID:** Copy and paste your Location ID here

- **Countries to Enable/Disable:** List the countries where you would like calling and/or texting turned **on** or **off**


Once you share this information, our team will create a ticket on your behalf and an LC Phone specialist will review and make the necessary updates.

If you are using LC Phone, all locations will be enabled with geo permission for most countries except high-risk countries
