# Auto Follow-Up Action in Conversation AI

Modified on: Wed, 11 Jun, 2025 at 10:42 AM

The Auto Follow-Up feature in HighLevel’s Conversation AI empowers your bot to automatically send timely outbound messages to contacts who have gone inactive, asked for a follow-up, or stopped responding—eliminating manual follow-up tasks and complex workflows. This smart automation helps you boost engagement and close more deals, all while maintaining natural, responsive conversations.

# **What is Auto Follow-Up in Conversation AI?**

Auto Follow-Up is an intelligent automation tool within HighLevel’s Conversation AI that detects when a contact drops off, becomes inactive, or requests a future follow-up, and then schedules and sends follow-up messages automatically. By leveraging AI, the system recognizes common drop-off scenarios—such as a user saying they’re busy, asking for a specific follow-up time, or simply not replying—and ensures that your leads remain engaged without requiring manual intervention.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Auto Follow-Up**

Auto Follow-Up delivers several user-focused advantages designed to streamline communication and maximize results.

- Reduces manual workload by automating follow-up messages, freeing up your team’s time.

- Boosts engagement with timely, personalized outreach that keeps conversations alive.

- Minimizes lead leakage by ensuring no contact is forgotten or left unengaged.

- Supports custom messaging so you can use AI-generated follow-ups or craft your own.

- Integrates with workflows to tag contacts, assign conversations, or notify users as needed.

- Respects business hours by only sending follow-ups during your defined working hours.

- Switches channels dynamically to maximize deliverability (e.g., from Live Chat to SMS).

- Provides full visibility with all scheduled follow-ups displayed in the Response Info panel.

## **How To Setup Auto Follow-Up in Conversation AI**

Proper setup of Auto Follow-Up ensures your Conversation AI bot can re-engage leads effectively and in alignment with your business needs. Follow these steps to enable and configure Auto Follow-Up:

```
Note: Do not trigger another followup through a workflow—this breaks the follow-up logic.
```

### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Conversation AI Bot

1. ### Log in to your HighLevel account.

2. From the left-hand menu, click on **AI Agents**.

3. Select **Conversation AI**.

1. **Create a new bot.**(Follow this guide to setup a new bot: **[Setting Up Conversation AI](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004401-setting-up-conversation-ai)**)

### **Step 3:** Enable Follow-Up Scenarios

Each follow-up scenario defines when the bot should send follow-ups. HighLevel currently supports 3 main scenarios:

#### **Scenario 1: Contact Stopped Responding**

1. Toggle ON the **Enable scenario** button.

2. You can now add up to **5 follow-up sequences** for this condition.

3. For each sequence:





   - **Set the delay time** in hours, days, or minutes.

   - Choose **Let AI Send the Message** _(Auto-generate contextual messages based on the conversation)_.

   - Or, **turn OFF** and enter a **Custom message** manually.

   - **Trigger a Workflow (Optional)**: Toggle ON if you want to trigger an existing workflow and select it from the list.
4. Click on the **\+ Add Followup** button to add a new sequence.

#### **Scenario 2: Contact Marked as Busy**

1. Toggle ON the **Enable scenario** button.

2. You can now add up to **5 follow-up sequences** for this condition.

3. Repeat the same configuration steps as above:





   - Set **delay** **time**

   - Choose **AI-generated** or **C** **ustom** message

   - Assign a **T** **rigger** W **orkflow** (optional)

#### **Scenario 3: Contact Requested a Follow-Up**

1. Toggle ON the **Enable** **scenario** button.

2. You can now add up to **5 follow-up sequences** for this condition.

3. Repeat the same process:





   - Set **delay time**(The **first sequence for this scenario will be pre-set** as per the contact's request)

   - Choose **AI-generated** or **C** **ustom** message

   - Assign a **T** **rigger** W **orkflow** (optional)

![](https://jumpshare.com/v/KMsDNqrt7NyGn3FPM4mb+/GIF+Recording+2025-06-11+at+8.00.17+PM.gif)

### **Step 4:** Follow-Up Settings

To improve engagement and respect timing preferences, configure these advanced options:

#### **A. Set Follow-Up Working Hours**

1. Click on **Follow-Up Settings.**

2. Enable **Working Hours** toggle.

3. Set the specific hours when follow-up messages should be sent (e.g., 9 AM – 6 PM).

4. If disabled, messages will send **regardless of time**.

5. Click on **Save**.


```
Note: This setting ONLY applies to follow-up messages, not to the main AI agent conversations.
```

![](https://jumpshare.com/v/yWfVZXV2SHsSS9qzCHUU+/GIF+Recording+2025-06-11+at+8.19.54+PM.gif)

#### **B. Enable Dynamic Channel Switching**

1. Click on **Follow-Up Settings.**

2. Enable **Dynamic Channel Switching.**

3. This allows the AI to automatically switch to another available channel if the original one becomes inactive.





   - For example, if the contact doesn’t respond on Live Chat, the bot may follow up via **SMS**, **Facebook Messenger**, **Instagram**, or **WhatsApp**, depending on available channels.
4. Click on **Save**.


![](https://jumpshare.com/v/E508SkncPwZuxEbW9jYQ+/GIF+Recording+2025-06-11+at+8.21.59+PM.gif)

### **Step 5:** Save Your Follow-Up Settings

1. Finally, click the global **Save** button to confirm and activate the Follow-Up Actions for the bot.

- Identifies “busy” responses (e.g., “I’m driving”).

- Recognizes requests for follow-up at a specific time and schedules accordingly.

* * *

## **Dynamic Channel Switching**

To maximize engagement, Auto Follow-Up can switch channels if a contact is unresponsive, helping you reach contacts where they’re most likely to reply.

- Switches from Live Chat to SMS if chat is inactive and a phone number is available.

- On platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp, switches to SMS if no response within 24 hours.

- This feature is optional and can be disabled.

* * *

## **Full Visibility in AI Response Info**

All scheduled follow-ups are displayed in the Response Info panel, giving you complete transparency and control over your automated outreach.

- Easily track which follow-ups are pending and why.

- Maintain oversight of all automated communication.
