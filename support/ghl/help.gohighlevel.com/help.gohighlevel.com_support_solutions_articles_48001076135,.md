# **What is Adding a Custom Form to Calendars**

Custom forms in HighLevel allow you to gather personalized information from contacts before they book an appointment. When you connect a form to a calendar, users must complete the form after selecting a time slot. This ensures you collect vital data that gets saved directly to the contact’s CRM record, enabling personalized and efficient follow-ups.

```
In order to add custom forms to your calendars, you will first need to have created a form in your sub-account. Click here to learn how to create custom forms.
```

## **Key Benefits of Using Custom Forms with Calendars**

Attaching a custom form to your calendar booking flow ensures that you capture the most relevant details before an appointment is set. This improves lead handling, automates data collection, and enhances your ability to deliver personalized experiences.

- **Lead Qualification:** Ask important pre-booking questions to filter out unqualified leads.

- **Automated Data Collection:** Map form responses directly to contact records for CRM efficiency.

- **Improved Personalization:** Use collected data to tailor communications, services, or offers.

- **Reduced Back-and-Forth:** Get all the necessary details upfront to avoid delays or follow-ups.

- **Compliance and Consent:** Add terms, agreements, or consent checkboxes to meet legal needs.

- **Workflow Triggers:** Initiate automations based on custom field responses submitted in the form.

- **Better Client Experience:** Provide a seamless and structured way for clients to share info before booking.

## **How To Set Up Custom Forms with Calendars**

Connecting a custom form to a calendar ensures you collect key details from users before they book time with you. Setting this up requires just a few simple steps.

### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Desired Calendar

- Navigate to **Calendars** in the main menu then click **Calendar Settings** in the secondary navigation ribbon.

- Find the calendar you'd like to edit and click **Edit** located to the right of the calendar name.

## **How to Add the Same Form in Multiple Calendars**

If your business offers several appointment types or team member calendars, reusing one consistent form can save time and maintain uniform data collection. This is helpful when you need the same intake or qualification data across services or departments.

- After creating the form under **Sites > Forms**, you can assign it to multiple calendars.

- Simply repeat the same process for each calendar you would like to assign the form to:





1. Navigate to **Calendar Settings**

2. Click the **Edit** button

3. Then choose the form from the **Select Form** dropdown.

```
Custom Forms Must Be Added Individually Per Calendar

Adding a form to a calendar is a manual process, forms are not auto-applied across calendars. Even if you're using the same form across multiple calendars, you need to add it to each calendar’s settings separately. This gives you control over which form appears on which booking flow.
```

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I use more than one custom form on a single calendar?**

No. Only one custom form can be attached to a calendar at a time.

**Q: What happens to the data submitted in the form?**

Form responses are automatically saved to the contact’s record in your CRM, as long as the form fields are mapped to custom fields.

**Q: Can I use the same form on multiple calendars?**

Yes. A single form can be assigned to multiple calendars by selecting it in each calendar's settings.

**Q: Why isn’t my form showing up in the calendar dropdown?**

Make sure your form is saved under **Sites > Forms** and contains at least one field. You may need to refresh the calendar settings page after saving.

**Q: Does the form appear before or after selecting a time slot?**

The form appears after a time slot is selected. Users choose a time first, then complete the custom form to confirm the booking.

**Q: Can I edit the form after attaching it to the calendar?**

Yes. Any changes to the form will automatically reflect in calendars it’s attached to. However, be careful not to delete critical fields tied to automations or records.
