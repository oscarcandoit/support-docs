Elementor 2.8.0 is just around the corner and with it, we are introducing a new Color Picker control and parting from the trusty old Iris color picker.

By doing so, we are removing all `wpColorPicker` assets:

- Iris.js
- wp-color-picker.js
- wp-color-picker-alpha.js

Including all of their dependencies.

Other than that we are deprecating the `elementor.helpers.wpColorPicker()` method and it will probably won’t work as expected anymore.

So if you did call it directly for some reason (why would you do that??) you need to either update your code to work with the new color picker or enqueue the removed assets yourself.
