Elementor CoreBasic

Before starting to work, make sure you meet the requirements as outlined below.

## [\#](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/getting-started/requirements/\#server) Server

To start working you’ll need a WordPress site, preferably with a fresh installation of WordPress (either local host or staging/development environment). You can use the basic [server requirements required to run WordPress(opens new window)](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).

Your server should be using a PHP version that meets or exceeds [Elementor’s requirements(opens new window)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/#installation).

## [\#](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/getting-started/requirements/\#plugins-and-themes) Plugins and Themes

Your site should have both the [Elementor plugin(opens new window)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) and [Hello theme(opens new window)](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/) installed. If you’re planning on developing addons for Elementor Pro, you’ll need to have [Elementor Pro(opens new window)](https://elementor.com/pro/) installed.

## [\#](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/getting-started/requirements/\#programming-languages) Programming Languages

We also recommend you have a working knowledge of [WordPress plugin development(opens new window)](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/), and familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
