# Access and Environments

**What is the new [integration environment](https://developer.servicetitan.io/docs/get-going-environments)?**

The integration environment is the equivalent of the sandbox environment. We recommend you perform your development and pre-production testing activities in this environment first and then move to production (Go-Live).

**Who will have access to the integration environment and how do I request for access?**

All developers and ServiceTitan customers will get access to one instance of the integration environment for performing your development and pre-production testing activities. To request access please visit the [Request Access](https://developer.servicetitan.io/request-access) tab.

If you represent a ServiceTitan customer’s organization and want to request access, please have your ServiceTitan admin send an email to [integrations@servicetitan.com](https://developer.servicetitan.io/docs/faqs-environments/#).

If you represent an existing or potential developer organization (including 3rd party app developers, integration developers, technology developers) please fill up the form on the [Request Access](https://developer.servicetitan.io/request-access) tab and one of our team members will get in touch.

**In my organization we have 10 developers (users). Can each one get their own instance of the integration env?**

No. Currently we offer one instance per customer and expect all the users to share an integration environment. You can create as many users as you want. If you have a special scenario please contact us and we will evaluate.

**Will I have access to both the integration and production environments?**

As a ServiceTitan customer you will have access to both the integration and production environment. Developers have access to the integration environment only.

**What is the integration environment data policy?**

As a ServiceTitan customer you have the option to have a copy of your production data moved into your integration environment and request to have it refreshed periodically or just choose to have standard demo data. Please email integrations@servicetitan.com for these requests.

ServiceTitan developers will have the standard demo data option only.
