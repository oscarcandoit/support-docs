# **Customers Engaging with 3rd Parties**

**I’m a ServiceTitan customer — can I add third-party users to my ServiceTitan account and let them access APIs for building integrations?**

No. Please reach out to ServiceTitan Integrations at integrations@servicetitan.com for guidance. Our team will review your use case and advise you on the best and most secure way to proceed.

In general, adding third-party users to your account, granting them Admin access, or giving “Generate API Key” permissions to anyone outside your organization poses significant security risks and is not recommended.

**Can I create an app on behalf of a third-party organization and share the App Key with them?**

No. Creating an app on behalf of a third-party and sharing its App Key is a security violation and exposes your organization’s data to risk.

ServiceTitan provides secure, approved methods for engaging with third parties. Please contact integrations@servicetitan.com for guidance before initiating any such setup.

**I want to engage a third-party developer to build a custom integration — how should I proceed?**

Before engaging with any third-party developer or integration provider, please contact integrations@servicetitan.com.

The ServiceTitan team will review your case and recommend best practices to ensure the integration is set up securely and in compliance with our standards. As a general rule:

- Do **not** add third-party users with Admin access.

- Do **not** grant “Generate API Key” permissions to users outside your organization.

- Do **not** create or share an App Key on behalf of a third-party organization.
