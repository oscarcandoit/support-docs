# Inventory APIs

**Inventory**

In order to record the purchase of items for business use, a purchase order must be created within ServiceTitan. A purchase order records that items were ordered from a vendor, to be shipped to a location.

Vendors—The vendor or supplier of what was purchased

Purchase Orders—The record of the purchase. Records that items were ordered from a vendor, to be shipped to a location.

Purchase orders are assigned a purchase order type, and the costs are booked against a specific business unit, which are used for categorization and reporting. A purchase order can be associated with a specific job, project, and technician to facilitate additional reporting. Once created, a purchase order will proceed through various statuses as it is sent and subsequently fulfilled, in whole or in part, by the vendor.

Each purchase order is associated with a specific vendor. Each vendor must be configured with their main address. A vendor can be configured with the contact information of a primary contact, default settings for the applicable tax rate, and how purchase orders are to be delivered.

Things to know:

- Vendors, business units, and inventory locations must be configured before a purchase order can be associated with them

- Jobs, projects, and technicians must be created before the purchase order can be associated with them

- Purchase orders are created in Pending status.

- A purchase order status cannot be updated through API. The current status can be retrieved as part of the GET call payload.

- Once a purchase order has been exported from ServiceTitan to an accounting system, it can no longer be edited.


High level use cases for these APIs:

- Retrieve information about vendors

- Create a vendor

- Retrieve information about purchase orders, including their current status

- Create a purchase order
