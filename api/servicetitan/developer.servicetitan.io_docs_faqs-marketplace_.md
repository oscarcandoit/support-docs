To get your product or service listed in our Marketplace, you must first join our Partner Program and sign a formal agreement with ServiceTitan. The process involves meeting several requirements, including 1) passing an Information Security Review, 2) adhering to our API Terms of Use, and 3) committing to our partnership terms.

Once these steps are completed, our team will guide you through the process of publishing your Marketplace listing. To start, you can fill out our Partner Program Application [here](https://developer.servicetitan.io/docs/faqs-marketplace/#).

**I’m a 3rd Party Developer, am I able to have both my public and private applications listed in the marketplace?**

No. Only public applications will be eligible to be listed in the ServiceTitan Marketplace.
