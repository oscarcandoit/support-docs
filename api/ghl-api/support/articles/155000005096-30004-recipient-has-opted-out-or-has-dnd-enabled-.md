**ERROR: 30004**

* * *

**Possible Causes**

- The destination number you are trying to reach is blocked from receiving this message.
- The device you are trying to reach does not have sufficient signal.
- The device cannot receive SMS (for example, the phone number belongs to a landline).
- The destination number is on India's national Do Not Call registry.
- There is an issue with the mobile carrier.
- You have sent a message from a US/CA Toll-free number to an end user handset that has previously responded with "STOP" or another opt-out keyword.

**Possible Solutions**

**"Undelivered" messages sent to India**

Error 30004 results on undelivered messages sent to India could be due to the destination number being listed on the national Do Not Call (DNC) registry.

**Lead Connector support team** can help investigate what went wrong with delivering your message. Please collect 3 or more message examples in your SMS logs from the last 24 hours that were flagged with Error 30004, and open a support request.
