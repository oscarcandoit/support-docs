## **What is this feature?**

The Multiple Phone Numbers for a Contact feature is designed to enhance the user experience in managing contact information within a CRM system. Here are some detailed aspects of this feature:

**Adding Multiple Phone Numbers:** This feature enables users to add up to eleven phone numbers for a single contact. This capability provides greater flexibility for users who frequently need to manage clients or leads with multiple contact numbers. This could include home, work, mobile numbers, or different numbers that a client prefers to use at different times.

**Convenient Management and Editing:** All the phone numbers added to the contact can be easily managed and edited within the contact details page. This feature makes it easy to update contact information as it changes, ensuring that the CRM always contains the most accurate and up-to-date information.

**Designation of a Primary Phone Number:** Users can designate a primary phone number for all actions and interactions with the contact. This primary phone number will be the default for all communication activities unless otherwise specified, ensuring consistency in communication.

**Phone Number Labels:** To better categorize and differentiate the contact's phone numbers, users can add labels to each phone number. Current labels include Home, Landline, Mobile, and Work. Each label can be selected only once for a contact.

**Calling on Additional Phone Numbers:** The feature also allows users to call on any of the additional phone numbers, giving them more flexibility in communication.

**Upcoming Enhancements:** Future enhancements to this feature include conversation support for additional phone numbers, bulk import functionality for adding multiple phone numbers, and availability of additional phone numbers during Contact Export.

### **Usage Cases:**

**Streamlined Customer Service:** A business could use this feature to reach its customers more effectively. The service representative can try another if a customer cannot be reached on one number. This flexibility can lead to faster resolution times, higher customer satisfaction, and improved customer retention rates.

**Effective Sales Process:** In sales, time is of the essence. Sales representatives can quickly try another if a lead is not responding to one number. This feature could help reduce the lead response time and increase the likelihood of converting leads into customers.

**Enhanced Marketing Campaigns:** Businesses running multichannel marketing campaigns could use different phone numbers to reach customers based on their preferences or past responses. This can help improve campaign success rates and deliver personalized customer experiences.

**Reliable Vendor Management:** Companies often deal with vendors who have multiple contact points. Storing and categorizing these within the vendor contact can improve communication efficiency and ensure seamless operations.

**Effective Employee Communication:** In larger corporations, employees might have different contact numbers for different departments or roles. Storing and managing these multiple numbers can streamline internal communication and enhance productivity.

**Emergency Response Situations:** Multiple contact numbers can be a lifesaver in healthcare or disaster management industries. Emergency response teams can reach out to patients or affected people more effectively if one contact number is not available or reachable.

**Managing International Business Contacts:** For businesses operating in different countries, keeping track of international dialing codes and multiple phone numbers for overseas contacts can be challenging. This feature can help manage such information conveniently, leading to smoother international communication.
