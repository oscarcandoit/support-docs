**ERROR: 30008**

* * *

**Message Delivery - Unknown error**

**Possible Causes**

If a message you sent is not delivered to the end device and returns a 30008 error code, this means that delivery of your message failed for unknown reasons.

When Lead Connector receives a very generic error from our carrier partner that we have no further details about, we associate the message with the error code 30008, letting you know that Lead Connector truly doesn't know what caused this error from the provider.

**Possible Solutions**

- Try sending a shorter message to the phone, with simple content that does not include any special characters. This would give our support team an idea as to whether the failure is related to concatenation or character encoding.
- Lead Connector support can help investigate what went wrong with our carriers. Please open a support request and include a minimum of 3 or more message where a 30008 error was thrown. Per our carriers' requirements, these SIDs can be no older than 48 hours at most.
