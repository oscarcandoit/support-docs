## **Troubleshooting**

### **Why are my Lead Ads not making it into my Sub-Account?**

1. Are you an admin of the Facebook page - [How to add an admin to my Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706?id=2190812977867143)

2. Can you confirm that your Facebook ads manager selects the correct FB Lead Ad form and matches the one in your Sub-Account? -[https://web.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager](https://web.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager)

3. Now in your Sub-Account, **check in settings** \> **integrations** \> **Facebook form fields mapping** if there is a blue tick mark next to the form you have selected in ads manager.

4. If you are, in fact, the FB Admin, can you try this to confirm if Lead Connector is accessible and can allow access to your page?

6\. Once you have completed the steps in the video above, please use the[**Facebook leads ads testing tool**](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) to see if leads are now being added to your Sub-Account.

Choose the correct page and Form in the [Lead Ad Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) and hit **Create Lead**. Keep clicking on **Track Status** until you get a result. If you get a failure status, then proceed to the next step.

**Please Note:**

```
When testing are you able to locate the App ID 390181264778064

If the app ID does not show up or if the test fails, then LeadConnector does not have access. If that is the case please continue to the steps below.
```

Go to [Business.Facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com/), head to **Business Settings** **>Integrations> Leads Access**. Go to **CRMs**; if you do not find LeadConnector in the list, that is why the Lead Ads Test tool gave you the error **"CRM Access has been revoked from Lead Access Manager."**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48291838218/original/U29MPxp53-OUuYPmglxyLYFUw4Yr1wNgag.gif?1681128673)

Then go back to your CRM account> Settings> Integrations> Disconnect your Facebook Connection by clicking Connected. Reconnect your Connection by clicking Connect a Page and then choosing your page from the dropdown.

Once your page is reconnected, head back to [Business.Facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com/) , head to **Business Settings** **>Integrations> Leads Access**. Go to **CRMs.** Click on **Assign CRMs**. Choose LeadConnector from the list and grant it access.

## **Common Errors**

### **Page Quality Issue :**

Suppose our user is facing this issue. Our customer needs to raise a support ticket with Facebook Support.

**Steps to resolve:**

- Users need to switch to the Facebook page on Facebook, Go to [this link](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=profile_quality) and raise a support ticket with Facebook if there is an issue.
- [FB Support Doc:](https://www.facebook.com/help/1985220725104252)
[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155003154624/original/bLqtVKBN8UGINMxfZBUzjg1AD6jNnUa8kA.png?1689689045)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155003154624/original/bLqtVKBN8UGINMxfZBUzjg1AD6jNnUa8kA.png?1689689045)


### **Permission Issue:**

The easiest way to find the issues is by trying to fetch the latest FB/Insta message and the latest lead.

This is how Zapier does it, and it helps us easily find the missed permission. FB API will present an error if permission is missing or for other reasons. Troubleshooting steps are as follows:

- Go to [this link](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools&ref=settings).
- [And then this link](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&ref=settings)
- Check if all the permission are enabled for all pages.
