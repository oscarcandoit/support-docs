### Scanning Your Website for Cookies

1. Temporarily disable the Cookie Consent Banner.

2. Use a free tool like [CookieServe](https://www.cookieserve.com/) to scan your website.

3. Review the detected cookies and assign them to the correct categories.


Important: Disable the banner before scanning, as it blocks non-essential cookies, preventing a complete scan.

## Integrating with Marketing Tools

To ensure proper tracking, categorize cookies correctly:

- Advertising – Facebook Pixel (fbp, \_fbc), other ad platform cookies.

- Analytics – Google Analytics (ga, \_gid), Google Tag Manager, other tracking tools.
