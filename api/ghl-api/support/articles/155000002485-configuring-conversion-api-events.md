## Steps to Create Your Access Token

1. **Open Events Manager:**

2. **Locate Your Pixel Settings:**
   - Click on your Pixel ID.
   - In the left side menu, click on “Settings”.
3. **Create Your Access Token:**
   - Scroll down to the "Server-Side API for Web" section.
   - Click on "Create Access Token" and follow the instructions.

   - You will be prompted to select the pixel, create or select an app, and create or select a user.
   - A token will be generated. Click on the token to copy it.

With your access token, you can now configure Conversion API events for robust and reliable event tracking on your website.
