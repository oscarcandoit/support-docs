We’ve introduced customizable email notifications for your Calendars! You can now send tailored emails when appointments are booked, canceled, rescheduled, or need reminders or follow-ups. Notifications can be configured for Contacts, Guests, Users, and any additional email addresses you specify. This feature allows you to streamline notifications to suit your business needs, ensuring effective communication with your customers.

# **Available Notification Options**

You now have the option to set up six different types of appointment notifications. These notifications can be either email notifications and/or in-app notifications.

1. **Appointment Booked (Unconfirmed Status):** Sent immediately when an appointment is booked with the unconfirmed status.

2. **Appointment Booked (Confirmed Status):** Sent immediately when an appointment is booked with the confirmed status confirmed or when an appointment's status is updated to confirmed.

3. **Cancellation Email:** Sent when an appointment is canceled, marked as no-show, or deemed invalid.

4. **Reschedule Email:** Sent when the appointment date or time is changed.

5. **Reminder Email:** Sent before the appointment based on the timing you configure.

6. **Follow-Up Email:** Sent after the appointment based on the timing you configure.

## **Important Notes**

### **In-App Notifications:**

1. The in-app notification configuration is customisable - for example, you can turn on the confirmation notification for the calendar but keep all other types turned off.

2. For **Event Calendars**, the default setting is that account admins will receive the notifications.

3. For other calendar types, the **assigned user** will be selected by default to receive notifications.

### **Email Notifications:**

1. **Additional Emails** refers to any extra recipients you want to notify. Simply add their email addresses, and they’ll receive the notifications as well.

2. You can create your email templates through the **Email Builder** in **Marketing module > Emails > Templates.**
3. Ensure you have added a **subject line in your email template** for successful delivery.

4. If you have enabled the **Add Guest** function and have included a custom form, you can send that custom form to the guest as well. Enabling this option will send a system-generated email to guests with a link to the custom form once their appointment is confirmed. To prevent duplicate emails, ensure a separate confirmation email is not already set up for guests (verify this in the Notifications tab under **Confirmation Notification**).
