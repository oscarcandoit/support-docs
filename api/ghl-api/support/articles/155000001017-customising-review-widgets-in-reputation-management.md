Click the "Create New Widget" button to begin crafting your custom review widget. Alternatively you can also choose from the existing template from the templates tab.

## 2\. Layout Tab: Configuring Widget Structure

In the "Layout" tab, you can define the fundamental structure of your widget:

- Select your preferred widget type: List, Masonry, Grid, or Legacy. The Legacy widget type retains the characteristics of our original widget style, primarily for backward compatibility, and offers limited customization options.
- Choose the source of your reviews, such as GMB and FB.
- Define the maximum number of reviews you wish to showcase.
- Toggle the option to enable or disable the "Powered by" section that is displayed at the end of the review widget.

## 3\. Content Tab: Editing Widget Header and Description

In the "Content" tab, you can fine-tune how your widget appears:

- **Enhance Widget Title and Description:** Craft compelling and on-brand widget titles and descriptions. Customise them to effectively communicate your message.
- **Header Section Customisation:** In the header section, you have the option to enable/disable the display of the rating, total review count, and "Write a review" button within the widget.

## 4\. Appearance Tab: Choosing Themes and Colours

The "Appearance" tab gives you control over the visual style of your widget

- Choose from Light, Dark, or create a Custom theme.
- If you opt for Custom theme, customise individual component colours such as widget heading colour, reviews colour, star rating colour, Background colour, Border colour and more.

## 5\. Settings Tab: Fine-Tuning Widget Behaviour

In the "Settings" tab, you can further refine your widget's behaviour:

- Enable or disable review elements like the display of the review date and reviewer icon.
- Choose to exclude reviews containing no description.
- Generate an embed code for your website. Copy the provided code and paste it into the HTML of your website to display your widget where you want it.
