## Introduction

Welcome to our new Guided form based setup

- **Guided Form Bot for Conversation AI**

Introducing our latest innovation in Conversation AI—a Guided Form Bot that makes bot setup faster, easier, and more precise than ever before! The Guided Form Bot is a new setup experience within Conversation AI that helps you build intelligent bots quickly and accurately—without needing to write complex prompts.

- **Quick Setup in Under 3 Minutes:**

Forget complex prompts. Just define what you want to achieve using simple objectives or questions, and the bot takes care of the rest.

- **No Prompting Required:**

This bot eliminates the need for large or complex instructions. It strictly follows your defined goals, delivering reliable, on-point responses every time.

- **Effortless Automation:**

Launch smart, task-driven bots in minutes—ideal for lead capture, qualification, data collection, and more.

Activate this feature to create high-performing bots with minimal effort—no prompting expertise required.

## **Why Use This?**

Creating bots using prompts can often be time-consuming or inconsistent—especially if you're not familiar with prompt engineering. The Guided Form Bot solves this by giving you a structured, no-prompt approach to building bots.

Let’s say you’re a business owner who wants to capture lead details like name, email, phone number, and the service a customer is interested in. With this setup, you can:

- Build bots without needing to write a single prompt.

- Define your goals in plain language.

- Trust the system to handle logic, flow, and follow-ups automatically.


This approach leads to:

- Faster setup times (under 3 minutes)

- Consistent and reliable conversations

- No need for AI prompt expertise


**This feature is currently enabled via labs**

## **Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Guided Form Bot**

### **Step 1: Go to the Create Bot Page**

Navigate to the **Conversation AI > Bots** section and click on the **Create Bot** button.

By default, you will be taken through the **Guided Form** setup flow.

> If you prefer the traditional prompt-based setup, click the dropdown icon on the "Create Bot" button and switch to that mode.

### **Step 2: Input Brand Information (Optional)**

This is an optional step but highly recommended.

You can input basic brand information like your business name, type, tone of voice, etc.

If you fill in the complete brand profile, the bot will generate more accurate and tone-aligned responses, enhancing your customer experience.

However, if you want to proceed quickly, you can skip this and still build a fully functional bot.

This section is strictly optional

### **Step 3: Configure Basic Bot Settings**

This section mirrors the setup used in prompt-based bots.

You can:

- Set an **Initial Message** that will always be sent when the bot interacts with a new contact.

- Configure basic properties like language, bot name, and behavior type.


This message sets the tone for the entire conversation and is shown before the objectives begin.

* * *

### **Step 4: Define Objectives and Questions**

This is the core of the Guided Form Bot setup.

Use this step to define what your bot should achieve. These can be goals like:

- Collect name

- Ask for email address

- Get phone number

- Capture the customer’s business website

- Understand the customer’s current issue


if any of these information is present and you dont want to collect again , you can turn on the toggle - skip if already filled

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047059109/original/9QU1br6MPBiCacMpYymg61zIwLd1OkFtaw.png?1747908700)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047059109/original/9QU1br6MPBiCacMpYymg61zIwLd1OkFtaw.png?1747908700)

You can write each of these as simple one-line objectives. The bot will:

- Follow the sequence exactly as defined.

- Never skip or ignore any objective.

- Prompt users clearly and consistently.


You can **reorder the questions** anytime by dragging and dropping them using the reorder icon.

If you want to collect more information you can do so by clicking the icon - Add Question / Objective.

Ex - what is the issue you are facing

### Step 6: Action Setup

1\. To book an Appointment select the Calendar.

2\. To trigger a workflow post appointment booking , trigger this workflow.

**3\. The remaining actions will soon be released for this version**

* * *

### Step 5: Final Review and Additional Settings

Once your objectives are set, your bot is ready to go live.

You can:

- Click **Edit Bot** to reconfigure brand details, bot settings, or questions.

- Add **Additional Instructions**—a short prompt to give the bot more specific context if needed.


This allows advanced users to fine-tune behavior without losing the simplicity of the guided setup.
