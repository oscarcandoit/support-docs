## **Setting up Gamification**

Gamification levels are **pre-defined.** Maximum levels are set to 9.

- As a group admin, user can edit the Level Names. To do this, go to Settings > Gamification & Rewards > Gamification > Click to edit the relevant level name.
- Make sure to hit the SAVE button.

## **How do levels and points work?**

Points are earned when others like your posts, comments, and replies. 1 like = 1 point for the post or comment author.

Users can also view leaderboards for the group they are currently in to see how their levels stacks up against other members. This will give a preview of which courses unlock at certain levels as well as the custom level names for each group.

You can find members who earned the highest points in the past **7 days, 30 days, and overall.**
