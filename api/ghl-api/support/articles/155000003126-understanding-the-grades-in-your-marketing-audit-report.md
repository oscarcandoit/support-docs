Each heatmap is scored in the range 0-100 as per following

- We check prospect's **rank at each map pin** for the chosen keyword and radius.

- **Nearer pins count more** than farther pins (center has the highest weight).

- Ranks → points: **1=10**, **2–3=8**, **4–5=6**, **6–10=4**, **11+=0**.

- For each ring, we compute **% of points earned** vs its max, then **apply the ring’s weight**.

- We **sum all rings** and convert to a **0–100 score**.


**Ring weights:** 3×3 → **60/40**, 5×5 → **50/30/20**, 7×7 → **40/25/20/15**.

**Read it:** **100%** = #1 at every pin; **0%** = not in Top 10 anywhere.
