**Google** has officially **updated** the **Reserve with Google** (Local Services Ads) **integration** process. To continue offering seamless online booking to your customers through LSA, you are now **required to set up** Google Organic Booking as part of the configuration.

* * *

## What is Google Organic Booking?

**Google Organic Booking** (also called **Booking Redirect**) enables customers to book services directly from your **Google Business Profile** (GMB listing), without needing third-party platforms.

By making booking seamless and accessible right from Google search, this feature helps businesses attract and convert local customers more effectively.

#### 2.2 Services Feed (Calendars)

- **Purpose**:

* * *

**NOTE:**

- **Ensure the Calendars have Description:** Please ensure that the calendars you are selecting have a clear description matching the Name of the Calendar/Service. This is crucial to get these validated on Google's end.


* * *

### Step 3: Upload Your Feeds

- After configuring the **Primary Action Feed** and **Services Feed**,

- **Click the "Upload" button** to send the feeds to Google.


? **Important:**

It typically takes **1–2 weeks** for Google to verify and publish your booking feeds.

## **? Step 2: Connect Your LSA Account to Google Business Profile (GBP)**

Your **LSA account** must be linked to your **Google Business Profile (GBP)** to activate bookings. Follow the steps in [this help article](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13450314?hl=en) to complete the connection.

### Manage Google Business Profile links

1. In your Google Ads account, click the Tools icon.

2. Click Data Manager.

3. Under "Connected products", find "Google Business Profile", then click **Manage & link** for new links

4. You will see all Linked Business Profiles, pending invitations.

   - If the locations are being used in active location assets a **View Location Assets** button will appears in the action column, next to **Manage**.

* * *

## **✅ Step 3: Automatic Activation**

Once your **GBP profile** is successfully linked, **LSA bookings** will be enabled automatically
