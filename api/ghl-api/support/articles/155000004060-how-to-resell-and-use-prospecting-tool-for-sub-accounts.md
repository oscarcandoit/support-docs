The **Prospecting Tool for Sub-Accounts** empowers agencies to provide their sub-accounts with the ability to search for new business prospects, generate marketing audit reports, and customise prospecting efforts based on niches, location, and other preferences. This tool is particularly useful for agencies that want to:

- **Resell prospecting services** to their clients.
- **Restrict access to the main agency dashboard** while still allowing sub-accounts to leverage powerful prospecting tools.

Key Features:

1\. Sub-Account Level Access

Agencies can now provide team members with direct access to the Prospecting Tool at the sub-account level, eliminating the need for access to the main agency dashboard.

2\. Reselling to Clients

Agencies can resell the Prospecting Tool to clients by activating it for individual sub-accounts. Clients can independently generate marketing audit reports, track analytics, and manage their prospects.

3\. Independent Prospect Management

Each sub-account now has its own dedicated view for managing prospects, audit reports, and analytics. Agencies can customise prospecting workflows for individual clients or teams.

4\. Seamless User Experience

- Easy Onboarding: Sub-account users can quickly get started with minimal setup.
- Integrated Reporting: Sub-account-specific analytics provide tailored insights.
- Enhanced Permissions: Agencies maintain control, enabling or restricting features for individual sub-accounts as needed.

Why it Matters?

For Agencies:

This update empowers agencies to:

- Delegate prospecting tasks to sub-account users without granting full agency-level access.
- Resell the Prospecting Tool to clients as a value-added service, driving additional revenue streams.
