# **Why Forward Calls Into LeadConnector?**

Call forwarding allows you to seamlessly connect your personal or business phone number with LeadConnector's Voice AI system. By forwarding calls to your LeadConnector phone number, you can:

- **Leverage Voice AI**: Enhance customer communication with AI-powered call handling and transcription.

- **Maintain Your Existing Number**: Keep your current phone number visible to customers without needing to update it on marketing materials or directories.

- **Streamline Operations**: Ensure all incoming calls are managed through your LeadConnector account for better tracking and management.

## **How Call Forwarding Works**

When call forwarding is enabled, incoming calls to your personal number (cell or landline) will be automatically redirected to your LeadConnector phone number. LeadConnector then handles the calls using its advanced Voice AI capabilities.
