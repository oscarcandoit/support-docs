## **Overview: What Is a Domain?**

A **domain** is the web address people type into a browser to access your online presence—such as `yourbrand.com`. On our platform, domains allow you to brand and power multiple tools including funnels, websites, blogs, webinars, client portals, and email communications.

### **What are DNS Records?**

DNS records (Domain Name System records) are essential building blocks of the internet. They act like a digital phone book, telling browsers and services how to reach your domain or subdomain by translating human-friendly domain names (like yourbrand.com) into machine-readable IP addresses.

## What You Can Do with Domains on Our Platform  You can manage all domain connections in one place, ensuring clear visibility and streamlined setup.  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047258561/original/tvuBWFXDe2WbCM1yUj4uSJxV4undgcJvSg.jpeg?1748329124)

- ### **Funnel / Website / Store / Webinar / Blog**


  - Use your domain to **host customer-facing pages** such as funnels, ecommerce stores, webinars, or blogs.
- ### **Client Portal**


  - Use your custom domain to host a **client-facing dashboard**.

  - Gives your clients a branded experience when accessing assets, campaigns, or reports.
- ### **Branded Domain (for White-Labeling)**


  - Connect a domain to **white-label** your sub-account or SaaS features.

  - This replaces the default `.hlpages.co` URLs with your own branding.
- ### **WordPress**


  - If you're using **our WordPress hosting**, point your domain to your WordPress site using provided DNS records.

  - The system will auto-detect and validate once DNS setup is complete.
- ### **Email**


  - A domain is required to **authenticate your email sending** (e.g., via SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

  - Connecting it improves email deliverability and ensures your messages aren’t flagged as spam.

## **Before You Get Started**

### **What do you need?**

- An active account

- A domain, either:

  - Purchased internally

  - Purchased via a third-party registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy)
- Access to the domain’s DNS settings (required for manual setup)


* * *

## Buying a Domain: Where to Start

Before you can connect a domain, you need to **own** one. There are two ways to purchase a domain:

### 1\. **Buy Directly**

- Easiest option handled fully inside the platform.

- Go to **Settings > Domains > Purchase Domain**.

- Search for your desired domain name and complete the purchase.

- Domains bought internally are automatically labeled as **Internal** and come with built-in DNS management and SSL.


### 2\. **Buy from a Third-Party Registrar**

- Use providers like **GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains**, etc.

- After purchasing, you’ll need to **manually connect** the domain by updating DNS records.

- These are categorized as **External Domains** in the system.


**Tip:** Make sure you have access to your registrar’s DNS settings if purchasing externally—this will be required during setup.

* * *

## Centralized Domain Management

All domains whether **internal** or **external** (connected via third-party providers) can be managed from the centralized **Domains** settings page within each sub-account.

### **What You Can Do**

From this page, you can:

- Add domains or subdomains

- View connected products (Funnels, Websites, Emails, etc.)

- Check domain and SSL status

- Access DNS settings (for internal domains)

- Identify and resolve required actions (e.g., verification, connection issues)


Domains are clearly labeled:

- **Internal Domains** – Purchased through our platform

- **External Domains** – Connected from external provider


### **Manage Domains**

- Includes tabs for **Connected Products** and **DNS Records** (DNS available for internal domains)

- Lists connected product types (Funnels, Email, Website)

- Status indicators help with quick troubleshooting

- Filters allow sorting by product type; the menu (three dots) provides edit/remove options


**Additional Features:**

- Search bar for quick domain lookup

- Auto-renewal and expiry tracking for internal domains

- Visual indicators highlight domains needing attention

## Root Domain vs Subdomain vs WWW

### **Root Domain**

- Your main domain name.

- Example: `example.com`

- Used for your primary site or homepage.


### **Subdomain**

- A prefix added to your root domain.

- Example: `blog.example.com`, `store.example.com`

- Used to separate different sections (like blogs, funnels, portals) without needing a new domain.


### **WWW (www.yourbrand.com)**

- Technically a **subdomain** of `yourbrand.com`.

- Example: `www.example.com`

- Often used as the default web address.

- Best practice: **Pick one** version (with or without `www`) and redirect the other to it for consistency and SEO.
