ERROR: 30035

* * *

**Description**

This message appears when a user tries to send SMS messages using a newly registered A2P 10DLC (Application-to-Person 10-Digit Long Code) number in the U.S., but the registration process has not been fully completed. While the brand and campaign may be approved, the carrier-level provisioning can take additional time, during which SMS sending attempts may fail.

**Possible Causes**

- **Pending Carrier Registration:** Even though your A2P campaign has been approved, it can take up to 24 hours for the number to be fully registered and activated with mobile carriers.

- **Premature Messaging Attempt:** The error may show if you attempt to send messages during this propagation period before the number is fully ready.

- **Incomplete A2P Setup:** In rare cases, your registration might still be under review or partially submitted.

**Possible Solutions**

- **Wait 24 Hours:** After A2P approval, wait up to 24 hours before sending SMS messages to ensure the number is fully registered across all carriers.

- **Avoid Sending Messages During Propagation:** Do not test or use the number until the waiting period has passed to prevent errors.

- **Verify Registration Status:** Check your A2P registration and phone number status in the Trust Center or Phone Number Settings.

- **Contact Support if Issue Persists:** If the error remains after 24 hours, reach out to support with your registration and number details for further assistance.
