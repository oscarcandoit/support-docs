In Business Suite, you can export a file that contains the information that people submit through your Instant Form. You can also download this data from [Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/794345304231812), request it through the [API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/guides/lead-ads/leads/v2.5) or access it through an [integrated CRM system](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/908902042493104). We recommend that you download your leads data directly from Business Suite if you don’t have a CRM system integrated with Facebook.

### To download leads data from Business Suite:

1. Go to [Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/).
2. Click **More Tools** from the menu.
3. Click **Instant Forms**.
4. Click **Download** next to the form with the leads you want to export.
5. Choose how you want to download your leads:
   - Click **Download New Leads** if you only want to export the leads that you’ve received since the last time you downloaded.

   - Click **Download by Date Range** if you want to download all the leads you’ve received during a certain time period. After you select this option, choose the preferred date range and click **Download**.
6. A window appears with your form information. Click **CSV** to download the leads data in your preferred file type.

**Note:** You have 90 days from the time a lead submits their form to download their information. Leads [expire after 90 days](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1526849577619206). We recommend that you export your leads data regularly.

When you download your file, if you don't see an Ad ID or Ad Set ID field, it may be because:

- The lead was generated via organic reach.

- The lead was submitted via an ad preview.

- You don’t have [advertiser privileges](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/195296697183682) on the ad account that created the lead ad campaign.


### To troubleshoot your file download:

If you can’t download your leads file:

- Check with your Business Manager admin to see if they’ve customized access permissions in [Leads Access Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1440176552713521).

- If they haven’t customized permissions, reach out to your Facebook Page admin to give you the correct access. Before customization, only Facebook Page admins can download leads.

- If they’ve customized permissions, make sure they’ve given you the correct access. After customization, only people [assigned access permission](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/540596413257598) can download leads.


### To Import The Leads Into the CRM:
