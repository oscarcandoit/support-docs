## Q. Can I use my existing WhatsApp number for the WhatsApp Business Platform?

Yes, you can use a phone number that is already associated with a WhatsApp Messenger or WhatsApp Business Account.

## Q. Failed to send a message because this user's phone number is part of an experiment

Starting June 14, 2023, roughly 1% of WhatsApp users will not receive marketing template messages from any business unless one of the following conditions is met:

- a [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#customer-service-windows) exists between the customer and the business
- an open [marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#conversation-categories) exists between the customer and the business
- an open [free-entry point conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#free-entry-point-conversations) exists between the customer and the business

If you send a marketing template message to a customer who is part of the experiment group, your message will not be sent and you will not be billed for it since no conversation was created

## Q. What steps do I need to take to use my existing WhatsApp number?

To use your existing number, you need to delete the existing WhatsApp account associated with that number. Follow these steps:

1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Go to Settings > Account > Delete my account. For more information, refer to the guide on how to [Migrate an Existing WhatsApp Number to a Business Account.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/migrate-existing-whatsapp-number-to-a-business-account/)

## Q. Can I use my number on both the WhatsApp Business Platform and the WhatsApp Business App simultaneously?

Yes, with the WhatsApp Coexistence feature, you can use your WhatsApp number on both the WhatsApp Business Platform and the WhatsApp Business App at the same time.

## Q4: Will I lose my data after migrating my WhatsApp number to the WhatsApp Business Platform?

Yes, you will lose all data associated with WhatsApp after migration. Meta does not allow data transfers between the platforms. It is highly recommended to take a backup of your data before proceeding with the migration.

## Q5: How do I backup my data before migrating my WhatsApp number?

To backup your data:

1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup.
3. Follow the prompts to back up your data to your preferred location (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud).

## Q. What are the benefits of verifying my Facebook Business Manager account?

Once Meta verifies your Facebook Business Manager account, you can initiate unlimited business conversations on WhatsApp.

## Q. What can I do if my Facebook Business Manager account is not yet verified?

While your verification is pending, you can:

- Initiate up to 250 business conversations in a 24-hour rolling window.
- Respond to customer-initiated conversations without any restrictions.
- Have two WhatsApp business numbers in an unverified Facebook Business Manager account.

## Q. What happens if my business verification is unsuccessful?

If your business verification is unsuccessful, you can continue using your WhatsApp business number with the restrictions mentioned (i.e., 250 business conversations in a 24-hour period and responding to customer-initiated conversations without restrictions).

## Q. How do I request verification for my Facebook Business Manager account?

To request verification, you need to provide proof of your legal entity and access to the business. Detailed instructions can be found in the guide on [Verifying your Business in WhatsApp Business Manager](http://q1:%20What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20verifying%20my%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account/?%20%20Once%20Meta%20verifies%20your%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account,%20you%20can%20initiate%20unlimited%20business%20conversations%20on%20WhatsApp.%20%20Q2:%20What%20can%20I%20do%20if%20my%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account%20is%20not%20yet%20verified?%20%20While%20your%20verification%20is%20pending,%20you%20can:%20%20Initiate%20up%20to%20250%20business%20conversations%20in%20a%2024-hour%20rolling%20window.%20Respond%20to%20customer-initiated%20conversations%20without%20any%20restrictions.%20Have%20two%20WhatsApp%20business%20numbers%20in%20an%20unverified%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account.%20Q3:%20What%20happens%20if%20my%20business%20verification%20is%20unsuccessful?%20%20If%20your%20business%20verification%20is%20unsuccessful,%20you%20can%20continue%20using%20your%20WhatsApp%20business%20number%20with%20the%20restrictions%20mentioned%20(i.e.,%20250%20business%20conversations%20in%20a%2024-hour%20period%20and%20responding%20to%20customer-initiated%20conversations%20without%20restrictions).%20%20Q4:%20How%20do%20I%20request%20verification%20for%20my%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account?%20%20To%20request%20verification,%20you%20need%20to%20provide%20proof%20of%20your%20legal%20entity%20and%20access%20to%20the%20business.%20Detailed%20instructions%20can%20be%20found%20in%20the%20guide%20on%20Verifying%20your%20Business%20in%20WhatsApp%20Business%20Manager.).

## Q. What are the recommended best practices to improve deliverability?

Opt-In Engagement: Send messages only to customers who have explicitly opted-in.

- Segment Your Contact List: Group your audience based on common characteristics to send targeted messages.
- Personalize Recommendations: Use customer behavior and purchase patterns to send personalized product recommendations.
- Emphasize Quality Over Quantity: Ensure your messages add value and resonate with your customers’ needs.
- Engage via Two-Way Conversations: Create meaningful interactions to keep customers engaged and interested in your brand.

## Q. WhatsApp is free to use for personal messaging. So, what do "WhatsApp conversation charges" refer to?

While the WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business app are free, businesses using the WhatsApp Business API to communicate with customers at scale are subject to conversation charges.

These charges apply when a business sends notifications to customers via the WhatsApp Business platform, especially if the customer has not responded within the last 24 hours. The cost depends on the customer's country code.

## Q: What is the WhatsApp Coexistence feature?

The WhatsApp Coexistence feature allows businesses to use their existing WhatsApp Business App account with LeadConnector's advanced CRM tools powered by WhatsApp Cloud API.

## Q: What version of the WhatsApp Business App do I need?

You need to have the latest version of WhatsApp Business App, version 2.24.17 or newer.

## Q: Do I need to link my WhatsApp Business account to a Facebook Page?

Yes, linking your WhatsApp Business account to a Facebook Page is a prerequisite for using this feature.

## Q: Can I use this feature if I've previously integrated with LeadConnector?

No, if you have previously integrated with LeadConnector, you need to delete your WABA account, download the WhatsApp Business app, and sign up again.

## Q: How do I link my WhatsApp Business account to a Facebook Page?

The article provides step-by-step instructions on how to link your accounts through the WhatsApp Business app.

## Q: Who is the Coexistence Feature designed for?

It's designed for WhatsApp businesses who primarily use the WhatsApp Business App and are looking for advanced tools to manage conversations at scale or integrate complex needs such as payments, shipping, and leads management.

## Q. Is there a limit on the number of marketing messages a Coexistence business can send on Cloud API?

The limit would follow the existing Messaging Limits. In addition, please note that you are not required to complete Business Verification in order to unlock a higher messaging limit than 250 business-initiated conversations in a 24-hour moving period. Open 1,000 or more business-initiated conversations in a 30-day moving period using templates with a high quality rating rating. Once you reach this threshold, we will analyze your messaging quality to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, we will then either approve or deny an increase. Businesses can increase their messaging limit from 250 to 1,000 and show their business’ display name.

## Q. If I already have the Meta Verified blue badge in WhatsApp Business App, will I be able to maintain that when I connect to a partner platform?

At the moment, WhatsApp Coexistence feature doesn’t allow blue badge verification transfers from the SMB app to the Cloud API or vice versa.

## Q. Why is my country not supported for WhatsApp Business accounts?

WhatsApp has restrictions on certain country codes due to regulatory, compliance, or service limitations. Unfortunately, if your country is on the unsupported list, you won’t be able to register a WhatsApp Business account using a phone number with that country code.

## Q. Can I use a phone number from a supported country while operating in an unsupported country?

Yes, you can register a WhatsApp Business account with a phone number from a supported country and use it while operating in an unsupported country. However, make sure to comply with local regulations and WhatsApp’s policies.

## Q. Do I need admin access to enable the Coexistence Feature?

Yes, in most cases, only users with admin privileges can access and modify this setting.

## Q.Will enabling the Coexistence Feature affect existing configurations?

No, enabling this feature will not overwrite or disrupt existing settings. It simply allows multiple functionalities to coexist smoothly.

## Q.Can I disable the Coexistence Feature after enabling it?

Yes, you can disable it anytime by returning to Settings → Labels and toggling the feature off.

## Q.Is it possible to retain the same phone number during the migration from the WhatsApp Business App to the Business Platform?

Yes, businesses can retain their existing phone numbers during the migration process, ensuring continuity in customer communications.

## Q.How long does the onboarding process typically take?

The duration of the onboarding process can vary depending on the complexity of the business's requirements but generally takes a few days to a week.
