We’re excited to introduce a major upgrade to your **Prospecting Reports** experience:

A **completely redesigned Web Report UI** and a powerful **Report Builder** that gives you total control over how your reports look and feel.

This update is all about helping customers tell their brand story, create better first impressions, and close more deals with custom-branded, high-converting reports.

## **What’s New in the Web Report UI?**

We've made big improvements to streamline the report reading experience — both for you and your prospects.

### ? UI Enhancements:

1. **Streamlined Header**

   - The previous sticky header that took up too much space is now fixed.

   - The header no longer obstructs content while scrolling.
2. **Optimized Layout**

   - We’ve removed empty white margins from both sides.

   - The report is now **cleaner, more compact**, and easier to navigate — with better content visibility and focus.
