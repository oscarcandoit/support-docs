# **What is a Dedicated sending domain?**

A dedicated sending domain allows you to send emails that appear to be coming from your brand, and this can help you maintain a better reputation with email services. Any company can create a dedicated sending domain, and it's quick and easy.

By default, all emails sent from our platform will show the name of our email-sending servers in the " **sent on behalf of**" or " **sent via**" email headers:
