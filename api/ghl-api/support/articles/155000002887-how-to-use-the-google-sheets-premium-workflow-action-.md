### **Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s)**

Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s) is an extension to the Lookup Spreadsheet Row. Using this we can extract multiple rows. The configuration will be the same as Look Spreadsheet Row just with an addition of selecting the number of rows you want to extract.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155025719351/original/UBHwpCpCW0i-lmy6t4QBIWy-Wh3aDZXI_A.png?1715178858)

#### **Using as Custom Variables:**

One of the advantages of using Lookup is that when you search for a particular row, all of its data can be saved as a custom value that can be utilized throughout your workflow.

Consider the following Worksheet as an example. If you need to search for a specific row, you can enter the contact phone number or email address in the lookup section. Once the lookup function finds the matching row, it will store all the values under the corresponding header name as custom variables.

#### **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015115/original/LGaxBgQwvGYJoILbTF4nkBZzWgXDoySsyA.png?1682260855)**

When you add a Lookup action, an index is automatically generated. This index is essential for mapping the row data to the custom variables and allows for easy identification of multiple lookup values. Removing or editing the index once it is added is impossible.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015133/original/XkZFM8oEj5xmLie9900hm1X7SmVVdhmidg.png?1682260890)

The values obtained from the lookup action for a particular row can be used in all other activities within your workflows, just like any other contact fields or custom variables.

**Please Note:**

```
As previously mentioned, the index generated by the lookup function serves as a reference and is used for internal mapping of the custom variables in lookup actions.
```

You can use {{sheet.x.rowNumber}} to get the row number of the lookup value.

Here x is the index of the lookup action.

**Example:**

The custom values of LookedUp Row can be utilized in all of the actions within your workflow. Some examples of how to do this are provided below.

#### **Important points to remember:**

- Referencing the Google Sheets Lookup Action cannot find a matching row; all subsequent Google Sheets Actions that reference this Lookup Action will be skipped due to lack of a result.

### **Update Spreadsheet Row using Lookup.**

Updating a spreadsheet row using Lookup involves searching for a specific row in your Spreadsheet based on a particular value using Lookup and then updating the values in that row with new data.

### **Delete Spreadsheet Row using Lookup.**

Deleting a spreadsheet row using Lookup involves searching for a specific row in your Spreadsheet based on a particular value using Lookup and then deleting all the values in that row.

To delete a specific row in a spreadsheet, you Should use Lookup Action to search for a column value in the data, which will return the corresponding row. Once you have located the desired row, you can use the "Delete Spreadsheet Row using Lookup" Action to clear the data in the row.

**Please Note:**

```
If you want to use the "Delete using lookup" action, it is necessary to first use the "Lookup" action to search for a specific row in your spreadsheet based on a particular value. Once you have found the desired row using lookup, you can then use the "Delete using lookup" action to clear the row data.

If a row is returned during a lookup, all the values associated with that row will be cleared.

#### **Points to Remember:**

- When you use the "Delete Spreadsheet Row" action, it clears the contents of the row, but it does not permanently remove the row itself.
- If the Lookup Action does not return any rows, the workflow will skip this step and proceed to the next one.
