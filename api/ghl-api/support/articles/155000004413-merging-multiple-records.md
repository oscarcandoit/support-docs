Merging contacts is a powerful way to clean up your database, eliminate duplicate records, and consolidate important information into one master record.

- Select the contacts you want to merge by checking the boxes next to their names.
- Click on the **Merge** icon on the top bar.

### **Step 2: Choose the Master Record**

- In the merge preview screen, choose the **Master Record**.
  - The Master Record is the primary record where consolidated data will be stored.
  - All non-conflicting fields from other records will default to the Master Record’s values.

### **Step 3: Review and Map Fields**

- **Mandatory Field:** Ensure you select a **Primary Email and Phone** for the Master Record if there are additional email addresses and phone numbers that needed to be added in the contact.
  - If there’s no Primary Email, remove additional emails and assign one as the primary to proceed.
- For conflicting fields (e.g., phone numbers, addresses), choose the data you want to keep.
- Information like **Courses, Community Groups, and Products** will automatically combine across all merged records. Other information like **Activities, Payments, Orders, Invoices and Appointments** will automatically default to the activity of the master record.

### **Step 4: Confirm the Merge**

- Double-check your selections in the merge preview.
- Click **Merge** to consolidate the selected contacts into one record.
- Once merged, the data from non-master records will be consolidated into the Master Record, and the duplicates will be removed.
