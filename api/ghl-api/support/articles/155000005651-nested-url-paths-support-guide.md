## Overview

The Nested URL Paths feature allows you to create hierarchical URLs for your funnels, websites, and webinars using forward slashes (/) to represent site structure. Instead of slashes being converted to hyphens, you can now define meaningful nested paths that reflect your content organization and improve SEO.

### Examples of Nested Paths

- /resources/courses/sales-funnel

- /webinars/2025/summer-session

- /campaigns/holiday/black-friday-offer

- /funnels/product-launch/step-1


* * *

## How to Use Nested URL Paths

- Go to any funnel, website, e-commerce, or webinar page or step.
- Click Edit.
- Enter your desired nested URL path, using / to create hierarchical structures.

## Best Practices

- Avoid trailing slashes - Use clean, canonical paths without a trailing slash (e.g., /path/subpath instead of /path/subpath/).

- Eliminate double slashes - Ensure there are no duplicate slashes in your paths (e.g., /path/subpath, not /path//subpath).

No empty segments - Avoid leaving blank segments between slashes (e.g., use /category/item, not /category//item).

- Use descriptive, meaningful paths - Clearly communicate the content and its hierarchy with readable, intuitive URLs (e.g., /blog/seo-tips instead of /b/123).

- Organize logically - Structure paths in a way that makes sense to visitors and mirrors your site's navigation or content hierarchy.

- Optimize for SEO - Well-nested, keyword-rich paths can boost search engine rankings by signaling clear content relationships.

## Conclusion

Nested URL paths offer powerful flexibility for organizing your content and improving your site's SEO. By following these guidelines and avoiding reserved paths, you can create a well-structured, hierarchical website that's both user-friendly and optimized for search engines.

Always test your nested paths thoroughly and ensure they align with your overall site architecture and marketing goals.
