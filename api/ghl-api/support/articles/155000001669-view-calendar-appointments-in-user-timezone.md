## How it Works?

Now, you can effortlessly view your **calendar, appointments and confirmation emails** in your default user timezone, providing a more convenient and efficient experience for users across different locations.

Imagine your **business** is in New York, USA (Eastern Standard Time - **EST**). **User A** is in Paris, France (Central European Time - **CET**), and **User B** is in California, USA (Pacific Standard Time - **PST**).

With the default user timezone set to CET for User A, they see all appointments in Central European Time, while User B views appointments in PST. This eliminates the need for manual conversion, letting users check appointments directly in their own timezone.

```
Note: On the Calendar View and Appointment List, you can now identify the timezone you are currently viewing in.
```

## Ensuring Accurate Availability:

### If Your User Timezone is Set to Your Actual Location:

- Simply input your usual availability, e.g., 9 am to 5 pm.

### If Your User Timezone is Set to a Different Location (for Viewing Appointments):

- Manually adjust your availability to match the selected timezone. For example, if your current location is in the UK (GMT +00:00), but you want to operate in New York (GMT -05:00), ensure to adjust your availability accordingly to align with the New York timezone.

Note: These changes are applicable only in the Calendar Module: Calendar View, Appointment List, Confirmation Emails.

To be implemented for:
Appointments under Contacts, Conversations and Opportunities
```

## FAQ

**Q: I want to see appointments in the business timezone. What do I do?**

A: To view appointments in the business timezone, set your user timezone to match the business timezone. For example, User A can set their timezone as EST to view appointments in the New York timezone.
