Pipelines are composed of stages, each representing a specific step in the customer journey or sales process.

Common stages include "Lead Capture," "Qualification," "Appointment Setting," "Follow-up," and "Closing."

## Best Practices

**Keep it Simple:**

- Avoid creating overly complex pipelines that may confuse users or lead to inefficiencies.
- Focus on essential stages and actions that align with your business objectives.

**Regular Maintenance:**

- Periodically review and update your pipelines to reflect changes in your business processes or customer preferences.
- Remove outdated actions or stages to streamline workflows and improve performance.

**Data-driven Decisions:**

- Leverage analytics and reporting features to gain insights into pipeline effectiveness.
- Use data to identify bottlenecks, optimize conversion rates, and enhance customer experiences.
