2. **Convenience**: Customers can shop anytime, anywhere, increasing accessibility and convenience.
3. **Reduced Overheads**: Eliminate costs associated with physical storefronts and gain flexibility in operations.
4. **Automated Transactions**: Streamline the sales process with automated payment processing and order management.

# Setting Up Your e-Commerce Store
