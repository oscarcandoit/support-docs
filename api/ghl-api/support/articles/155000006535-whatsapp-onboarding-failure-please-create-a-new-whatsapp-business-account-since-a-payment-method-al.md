If you encounter the error message:

**_“Please create a new WhatsApp Business Account since a payment method already exists for the current WhatsApp Business Account.”_**

This means that your existing WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) already has an active payment method associated with it.

Meta does not allow a WABA with an existing payment method to be connected again through another platform. Therefore, the onboarding process will fail if you try to reuse that WABA.

### **Why This Happens**

This error occurs because:

- The WABA you are trying to connect has already been used previously (either directly in Meta or through another Business Solution Provider).

- Meta prevents connecting a WABA that already has a billing setup or payment method to another BSP (Business Solution Provider) to avoid duplicate billing.


### **How to Fix the Issue**

To successfully complete onboarding, you need to **create a new WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)** under your existing Meta Business Manager.

Follow the steps below:

#### **Step 1: Go to Your Meta Business Settings**

1. Visit Meta Business Settings.

2. Log in using the Facebook account that manages your business assets.


#### **Step 2: Create a New WhatsApp Business Account**

1. In the **left-hand menu**, go to **Accounts → WhatsApp Accounts**.

2. Click on **\+ Add**.

3. Select **Create a New WhatsApp Business Account**.

4. Enter a unique name for the new account (example: _YourBusinessName-New_).

5. Complete the setup prompts.


#### **Step 3: Return to Whatsapp Onboarding Flow**

1. Go back to your WhatsApp onboarding flow.

2. When prompted to select a WhatsApp Business Account, choose the **newly created WABA**.

3. Continue the onboarding process normally.


### **Additional Tips**

- Do **not** delete your old WABA if it’s linked to other services or campaigns.

- If you are unsure which payment method is attached, visit Meta Payment Settings to review existing setups.

- Always use a **new WABA** for onboarding if you’ve previously connected the same number with another provider.
