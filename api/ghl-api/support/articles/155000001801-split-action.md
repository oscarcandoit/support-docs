**Purpose:** Divide your contacts into multiple paths based on a random percentage distribution, allowing you to test different variations of your workflow and identify the best performing one.

**Features:**

- **Random Split:** Send contacts to different paths with percentages you define (e.g., 60% to Path A, 40% to Path B).
- **Multiple Paths:** Create up to 5 separate paths for your contacts to follow.
- **Customizable Path Names:** Rename each path to clearly identify its purpose.
- **Stats Tracking:** View detailed statistics on the number of contacts entering and completing each path, as well as their goal conversions.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Add the Split action** to your workflow by clicking on the "+" icon to add an action and selecting "Split" from the "Internal Tools" category.

#### 4\. Use Cases

**Scenario:** You're an e-commerce store owner selling new running shoes. You have two email subject lines in mind: "Fuel Your Run with the Ultimate Shoe" and "Unleash Your Speed: Our Game-Changing Shoes."

**Solution:** Use the Random Split action to divide your mailing list randomly (e.g., 75/25). Send 75% of the list the "Fuel Your Run" email and the other 25% to the "Unleash Your Speed" email. Track website visits, purchase rates, and other key metrics for each path.

**Outcome:** After a set period, analyze the results and see which subject line led to higher engagement and sales. Now, you have data-driven proof of the best performing message, which you can confidently apply to future campaigns.

#### 5\. Points to be noted

- Once a contact heads down one path, that is their only path. If they re-enter they will not proceed down the other path they will always head down the original path.
