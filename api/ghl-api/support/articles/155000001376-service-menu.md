## What is a Service Menu?

The Service Menu is a **centralized** page to list all your services in one streamlined scheduling link. Imagine **neatly categorized** services, making navigation a breeze. What's more, your clients can access this menu to seamlessly **book multiple services** for themselves or even for their **guests**, all through a **single booking widget.**

The Service Menu displays the chosen **[Service Calendars.](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001375)** A Service Calendar is a **tailored** calendar type created for service-based businesses. In this calendar type, users can **create different services**, assign staff, **group** them together by categories, and display all of them in one single scheduling link - the **Service Menu.**

For example, a salon can have **Hair services** like ‘Hair Cut, Hair Spa, and Hair Coloring’ under the category Hair, whereas **Skin services** like ‘Facial, Clean Up, and Bleaching’ under the category Skin. The clients can then choose the services they want and schedule their appointments seamlessly.

**2\. Then, create a Service Calendar:** Design a dedicated calendar for each service you offer and assign the calendar to its respective group. Click **[here](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001375)** to know more about creating a Service Calendar
