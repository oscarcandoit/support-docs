In a Class Calendar, there can only be one appointment owner, typically the trainer or host. The number of spots per slot can be set, with a maximum limit of 9,999 attendees, though meeting location limitations do apply.

## **What is a Class Booking?**

A class booking is a one-to-many type calendar to host multiple invitees in a single booking. Class bookings are helpful when you want various invitees to attend a single event at once; some examples, but not limited to:

Webinars/Workshops

Training Sessions

Sports Events

### **Why use Class Booking Calendars?**

Using Class Calendars offers several benefits for managing events with multiple attendees, such as:

- Efficient organization: Class Calendars simplify organizing and managing one-to-many events by allowing you to create a single booking that accommodates multiple invitees, streamlining the scheduling process.
- Customizable capacity: You can set the number of spots per slot to control the class size and ensure an optimal learning or participation environment.
- Centralized management: Class Calendars provide a centralized platform to manage bookings, cancellations, and rescheduling, making it easier for the appointment owner to oversee all aspects of the event.
- Enhanced communication: Class Calendars facilitate better communication with attendees by providing a clear overview of event details, such as date, time, and location. This helps reduce confusion and the likelihood of no-shows.
- Time-saving: By automating the booking process and providing options for attendees to cancel or reschedule their appointments, Class Calendars save time for both the organizer and the attendees.
