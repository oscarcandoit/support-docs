## **Overview**

The Finalize Transfer step is where you complete the authorization process to move your domain from your current registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, IONOS, etc.) to your CRM. This step ensures that your domain and related services continue working smoothly after the transfer.

## What Happens During This Step

On the Finalize Transfer screen, you will:

1. Log into your current registrar (where you originally registered the domain)

2. Disable DNSSEC & Whois Privacy

3. Unlock your domain

4. Request and enter the authorization code (EPP code)

5. Submit the transfer and complete payment

## Login into your current registrar

Log into the domain register where you originally purchased your domain

## Disable DNSSEC and Whois Privacy

Before initiating a domain transfer, it is important to disable DNSSEC and remove Whois privacy protection from your current registrar.

### Steps (General Instructions):

1. Log in to your current registrar account.

2. Go to DNS or Domain Settings.

3. Find the option for DNSSEC and disable it.

4. If Whois Privacy Protection is enabled, turn it off.

5. Save changes

Note: It may take a few minutes for the DNSSEC record to be fully removed. You’ll see a confirmation on GoDaddy once the setting is updated.

## Unlock Domain & Get Authorization Code

Before transferring your domain, it must be unlocked, and you’ll need an authorization code (also called an EPP or transfer code) from your current registrar.

### General Instructions:

1. Log in to your current registrar account (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, IONOS).

2. Go to your domain management or domain settings section.

3. Look for the Domain Lock or Registrar Lock option.

4. Disable or turn off the lock to unlock the domain.

5. Once unlocked, locate the option to get the authorization code (may be labeled EPP code, Transfer Code, or AuthInfo).

6. The code may either be displayed on screen or sent to your registered email.

## Transfer Processing & Payment

When Confirm and Finalize Transfer is clicked, we will

1. Validate domain unlock status, auth code and for any other registry level statuses.

2. If the domain is valid for transfer, charge the wallet for the fee.

3. Submit the transfer request

## FAQS

1\. How long does it take after I finalize the transfer?

Once submitted, transfers typically complete within 1-5 days depending on your registrar. Some domains may complete faster if approved manually.

2\. I don’t see the option to unlock my domain. What should I do?

Some registrars hide this setting under “Security” or “Transfer Settings.” If it’s not visible, search their help center or contact their support.

3\. What if my auth code is wrong?

You’ll see an error. Double-check with your registrar and make sure the domain is also unlocked.

4\. Will transferring my domain cause downtime?

Not if DNS records are accurately reviewed and migrated before the transfer. Always cross-check.
