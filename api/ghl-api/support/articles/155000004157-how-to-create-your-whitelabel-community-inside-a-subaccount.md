Creating a white-label community involves customizing the community features to match your brand. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1\. **Access the Subaccount in**

- Log in to the app.
- Navigate to the sub-account where you want to create the community.
- Head over to Membership > Communities

### 2\. **Set Up the Custom Domain (White-Labeling)**

- In **Community Settings** \> **Domains**, add a custom domain (or subdomain) to host the community (inside a client portal). For example, `community.yourdomain.com`.
- Follow the instructions to update your DNS settings to point to your servers. This will make your community fully white-labeled under your domain.
- Note: The domain settings would be for Client Portal since a community exists within a client portal
