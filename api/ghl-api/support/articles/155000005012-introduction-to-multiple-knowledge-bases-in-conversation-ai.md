## Introduction

With the new **Multiple Knowledge Base** feature, you now have the flexibility to create and manage **separate knowledge bases for each AI bot**—a significant upgrade from the earlier model where all bots relied on a single, shared knowledge base.

This enhancement empowers you to organise content more efficiently and provide **bot-specific training**, ensuring each AI agent delivers more accurate and relevant responses.

## Why Use Multiple Knowledge Bases?

Let’s say you have the following setup:

- **Knowledge Bases:** A, B, and C

- **AI Agents:** Jane and Parker


With this feature:

- You can assign **Knowledge Base A and B to Jane** – she will only be trained on those.

- Meanwhile, **Parker can be trained exclusively on Knowledge Base C**, allowing each bot to serve different use cases or clients independently.


```
Note: The existing knowledge base that you have , you wont be able to delete it because it is by default used by the workflow bots .
The multiple knowledge base support for workflow bots will be released soon
```

## How to Set Up and Use Multiple Knowledge Bases

### **Step 1: Access the Knowledge Base Section**

Navigate to the new **"Knowledge Base"** menu item in the left navigation bar (as shown in the screenshot). This section houses all your KBs.

### **Step 2: Create a New Knowledge Base**

1. Click on **“Create Knowledge Base.”**

2. Enter a **name** for your new knowledge base—for internal reference.

3. Click **“Save & Continue.”**


> ✅ You can create up to **15 knowledge bases** in total.

### **Step 3: Train the Knowledge Base**

Once created, you can train your knowledge base in two ways:

- **Via URLs**: Add relevant links for the bot to learn from.

- **Via FAQs**: Manually enter questions and answers.


The training process remain same as previous version

> ? _Note: File uploads for training are coming soon!_

### **Step 4: Attach Knowledge Base(s) to an AI Bot**

1. Go to the **Conversation AI Bot** section.

2. Access the bot training and navigate to **Knowledge Base dropdown**.

3. Choose up to **7 knowledge bases** to train that bot.

### **Step 5: View and Manage Assigned Knowledge Bases**

- Assigned KBs appear as **tabs** within the bot settings.

- You can also create a **new knowledge base on the fly** by clicking **“Create New.”**

## Final Notes

This feature gives you **granular control** over how your AI bots are trained and respond—improving accuracy, relevance, and manageability across different use cases or clients.

If you're managing bots for multiple businesses or departments, **Multiple Knowledge Bases** is a game changer.
