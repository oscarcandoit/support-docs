**Update Email:** This helps users change their connected email ID to another one without disconnecting the previous connection.

## **Does Two-way sync only work with individual emails or bulk emails and workflows?**

How the sender domain mapping works for different types of emails:

**Individual Email:** On connecting a personal email account (Outlook), the outlook email ID will be considered as the sender domain for the emails sent by the user for individual emails.

**Bulk Email:** If the user enters their email ID (after setting up the two-way sync) under the “From Field”, the user email ID will be considered the sender domain for the bulk emails. If the field is blank, the sub-account level provider will be considered the sender domain.

**Bulk Email:** If the user enters an email ID different from their email ID connected (Outlook), it will consider the sub-account level provider as the sender domain.

**Workflow & Automation:** Emails will continue to go from sub-account level providers.
