## **Why Are Calls Marked as Spam?**

Carriers and mobile devices use algorithms to detect and flag suspicious calls. If your number is labeled as spam, customers may ignore or block your calls, impacting your business communication.

### **Common Reasons for Spam Labelling:**

- **High Call Volumes:** Making too many calls in a short time can trigger spam filters.

- **Unfamiliar Numbers:** Calls from numbers not recognized by the recipient or without proper caller ID.

- **Frequent Customer Complaints:** If your number has been reported as spam multiple times.

- **Low Engagement Rates:** If a high percentage of your calls go unanswered or are rejected.

- **SHAKEN/STIR Authentication Failures:** If your caller ID isn’t verified, it may be flagged.


## **Key Impacts of Calls Being Marked as Spam**

When your business number is flagged, it can lead to:

- **Decreased Answer Rates:** Customers may ignore flagged calls, reducing conversions.

- **Damaged Business Reputation:** Being labeled as spam can create a negative impression.

- **Communication Barriers:** Important calls may be blocked or filtered by spam detection systems.

## **How to Prevent Your Calls from Being Marked as Spam**

Follow these best practices to improve your call credibility and avoid being flagged.

**1.******Leverage Voice Integrity to Build Trust****

Voice Integrity is a game-changing feature that helps protect your business calls from being flagged as “Spam Likely.” By registering your U.S.-based phone numbers with top caller ID analytics providers—First Orion, Hiya, and TNS—you can improve pickup rates and reinforce your brand’s trustworthiness.

# **Why Turn On Voice Integrity?**

If your business numbers are flagged or blocked, Voice Integrity helps you:

- **Fix bad reputations** and clear “Spam Likely” labels from legitimate calls.

- **Increase pickup rates**—recipients are more likely to answer when your caller ID shows a verified, trusted name.

- **Ensure your calls are seen as authentic**, not suspicious.

- Boost **call answer rates** with a verified and trusted caller ID

- Help prevent your numbers from being **blocked** or **ignored**

- Maintain a **positive caller reputation** over time

- Establish **trust and credibility** with recipients

- Support consistent **branding** through accurate caller ID display


## **What You Need to Get Started**

Before activating Voice Integrity, ensure you meet these requirements:

- **SHAKEN/STIR Certification** (Required):

Confirms your calls are legitimate and not spoofed.

- **CNAM Registration** (Recommended):

Displays your business name as the caller ID, increasing credibility.

- **U.S. Phone Numbers Only**:

Currently, Voice Integrity applies only to U.S.-based numbers. International traffic is not supported.


**How to Enable Voice Integrity**

You can easily set up Voice Integrity in just a few steps:

1. **Navigate to:** **`Settings > Phone Numbers > Trust Center > Voice Integrity`** **``**

2. **Fill Out the Form**

Provide the requested business and phone number details.

3. **Submit Your Application**

Applications are typically processed within **2 business days**.

4. **Check Application Status**

Track progress under the **“Submitted Applications”** section in the Trust Center.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155050868460/original/OddZgB6aRQ0406LEcExqBFsJkmH141QXKQ.png?1754297297)


## **What Happens After You Register?**

Once you submit your information, each of the analytics providers—Hiya, TNS, and First Orion—will review your registration separately.

- Expect to receive confirmation emails within 2 business days

- Label removal may take time to propagate across all networks


### **2\. Enable SHAKEN/STIR Authentication (U.S. Only)**

### ****Note**- **An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is required to complete SHAKEN/STIR registration.** If you don’t have an EIN, we recommend registering your number with the [Free call registry](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004358-remediate-spam-likely-on-your-caller-id-using-free-caller-registry) instead.**

SHAKEN/STIR is a set of protocols designed to authenticate caller ID information and verify that it is coming from a legitimate source. The protocol works by using digital certificates to validate the caller's identity. When a call is made, the caller's identity is verified through these certificates, which are then stored in an online database. This ensures that when someone receives a call, they can trust that it is coming from who they think it is.

- These protocols verify your caller ID information, preventing fraud.

- Contact your phone service provider to enable SHAKEN/STIR on your number.


```
Note: SHAKEN/STIR won't remove nuisance labels but may boost answer rates due to the "Trusted Call" label.
```

### **3\. Update CNAM (Caller Name Presentation) Information**

Updating or adding CNAM (Caller Name Presentation) might increase call answers by offering accurate caller information, though it won't affect nuisance labels. CNAM is a feature in the United States public telephone network that identifies an incoming caller by a personal or business name associated with the calling party.

```
Note: CNAM doesn't remove nuisance labels, but accurate caller information can enhance answer rates.
```

- Ensure your number correctly displays your business name on the caller ID.

- Work with your carrier to register or update your CNAM records.


> **Any entity with a business registration number—including sole proprietors with an EIN—may sign up for CNAM. An EIN is mandatory, whether you’re a one-person operation or a larger, registered brand.**
