### **Overview**

The "Look Busy" feature is designed to help you appear more in demand on your booking widget by hiding a percentage of your available slots. This creates a sense of urgency for your bookers, as the number of visible slots is reduced. It's important to note that this feature only affects the booking widget; your entire schedule remains available and bookable through the in-app appointment modal.

* * *

### **How It Works?**

When you enable the "Look Busy" feature, you can specify a percentage of slots to hide from your total availability. Once set, this percentage of slots is randomly hidden from the widget. As bookers schedule new appointments, the number of visible slots remains constant until the actual number of slots available matches the number being shown. At that point, the widget displays the actual available slots.

For example: If you have four time slots available in a day and you choose to hide 50% of them, your clients might see only two available slots.

If you have ten time slots available in a day and you choose to hide 50% of them, this is how the slots would appear on the booking widget.

### **Important Notes**

- **Class Booking and Service Menu:** The "Look Busy" feature is currently not applicable for class bookings and service menus.
- **Appointment Modal**: All slots are shown in the in-app appointment modal, regardless of the "Look Busy" setting.
- **Recurring Appointments**: For recurring appointments, a slot may appear hidden due to the "Look Busy" setting on future dates, but it will still be booked based on the first slot's date and time and the recurrence settings.
