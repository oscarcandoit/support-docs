**Q: Why am I receiving a delivery incomplete error email from Gmail when I use a BCC address while sending emails from my 2-way sync email?**

**A:** You may receive a "Delivery incomplete" error from Gmail when using BCC addresses. Despite the error, your email might still be successfully posted to the CRM.This occurs because we use BCC for logging purposes, and Gmail doesn't get a delivery receipt for this BCC address. So, though the email is logged successfully you might receive the error email.
