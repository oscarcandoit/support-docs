**Overview**

The Number Intelligence feature is designed to help sub-account users reduce spam calls, verify number validity before sending SMS, and identify unknown callers. This article explains how the feature works, the benefits, and how you can manage it to fit your business needs.

**Key Features of Number Intelligence**

- Spam Detection detects and flags incoming spam calls from unknown USA numbers (+1 country code). If flagged, calls are tagged as “Spam Likely” in call logs and conversations.
- Name Lookup fetches the name of unknown USA callers, enabling personalized call handling.
- Number Validation verifies the validity of a number worldwide before sending the first SMS to ensure deliverability.

**Benefits of Number Intelligence**

- Reduce spam calls by stopping fraud calls before they reach your team.
- Increase call answer rates by reducing interruptions from spam, allowing you to focus on real leads.
- Greet incoming leads with their name with Name lookup.
- Increase SMS delivery rate and maintain healthy metrics by ensuring messages reach valid numbers.

**How to Enable or Disable Number Intelligence**

To enable or disable Number Intelligence on the web app, go to Settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > Number Intelligence. Toggle the switch to enable or disable the feature. When enabled, all three components (Spam Detection, Name Lookup, and Number Validation) are activated.

**How It Works**

- Spam Detection checks incoming calls only from unknown phone numbers (not saved as contacts). It applies only to numbers from USA.
- Name Lookup fetches names for unknown callers from USA before you answer the call, enhancing customer engagement.
- Number Validation verifies new numbers worldwide before sending SMS to avoid errors or undelivered messages.

**Call Handling with Spam Detection**

Spam Likely calls are marked “Spam Likely” on the web dialler when you receive the call and shown with a tag in the Contacts tab for transparency.

**Where to See Spam Details**

Contacts flagged as spam will have a visible “Spam Likely” tag in the Contacts tab.

**Incoming Call Logic Update**

Perform Name Lookup for USA phone numbers when:

- The number is unknown (contact does not exist).
- The contact exists, but the name field is empty.

**FAQs**

What happens if I disable Number Intelligence?

When disabled, spam calls, name lookups, and SMS validations will no longer be performed. Calls and SMS will proceed as usual, but spam may not be flagged, names on unknown callers will not show up.

Can I customize which features of Number Intelligence are enabled?

Not currently. All three features—Spam Detection, Name Lookup, and Number Validation—are activated or deactivated together.

Does this feature work outside USA?

Spam Detection and Name lookup currently applies only to calls from phone numbers from USA. SMS validation works worldwide.

How does the system handle spam calls?

Spam calls are flagged as “Spam Likely” and can still appear in call logs and conversations. You can later add these numbers to an inbound DND list for further blocking.

Will I be notified of spam calls?

Yes, spam calls will appear in your call logs and the Contacts tab, tagged as “Spam Likely.”
