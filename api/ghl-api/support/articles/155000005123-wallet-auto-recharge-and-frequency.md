1. The amount you see in dropdown 1 is the amount that will be deducted from your payment method when your balance falls below the amount set in dropdown 2.
2. Dropdown 2 is simply the threshold dropdown. the amount you set here will work as the threshold amount. so as soon as your wallet balance hits below this auto recharge will trigger with the amount set in dropdown 1.


# **What is Auto Ramp up and how does it work ?**

we understand it could get fairly confusing, but let us help make it simpler...

1. you see this magic pen with the text :

“ Recharge amount will be auto-updated based on your recharge history “

what it essentially means is, you auto recharge amount will jump to next tier with frequent usage.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045443513/original/WB_cr3CP8QmtczL9vPaBruONgZunMmjBXw.png?1745319936)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045443513/original/WB_cr3CP8QmtczL9vPaBruONgZunMmjBXw.png?1745319936)

for ex :

Your current recharge amount is set to 500$ and within a week if the recharge triggers thrice for the amount of 500$, it will update the auto recharge amount to next tier. i.e 1000$.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045443508/original/FtdupowvhlU5Uw5xMaarvywYBPRcGusKDg.jpeg?1745319935)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045443508/original/FtdupowvhlU5Uw5xMaarvywYBPRcGusKDg.jpeg?1745319935)

look at the image above to help you understand and clarify better.

Since it triggered 500$ recharge thrice within a week therefore 4th time it upgraded to next tier.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## What is Auto Recharge, and how does it work?

Auto Recharge automatically replenishes your wallet balance once it falls below a set threshold. When your wallet balance goes below the threshold amount you've specified (dropdown 2), the recharge amount selected (dropdown 1) is deducted from your payment method to refill your wallet.

## What is Auto Ramp Up, and how does it work?

Auto Ramp Up dynamically adjusts your auto recharge amount based on your usage history. If your current auto recharge amount (e.g., $500) triggers multiple times within a short period (e.g., three times in a week), the system automatically escalates your recharge amount to the next tier (e.g., from $500 to $1000).

## How can I disable the Auto Ramp Up feature?

To disable Auto Ramp Up:

1. Click on the three dots located on the right side of the auto recharge window.

2. Select the "Disable Auto-update" option.

3. Confirm your selection by clicking "Yes" in the subsequent dialog box.

4. You will then receive confirmation that the Auto Ramp Up feature has been successfully disabled.
