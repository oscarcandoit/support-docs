### **Overview**

Effortlessly connect your Calendly account to our system for seamless access to all your scheduled events. This integration simplifies crucial tasks like creating contacts, managing CRM data, scheduling workflows, and beyond. By optimizing the import process, it guarantees smooth integration of every new Calendly event into our system, boosting overall efficiency.

### **Prerequisites**

To get started, you'll need access to your Calendly account and at least one calendar that you are a part of, as only events created on calendars you're associated with will be fetched.

### **How does the Calendly Integration Work?**

The Calendly integration functions differently from other third-party calendar integrations like Google, iCloud, and Outlook.

**Calendly Event Sync:**

- Events from Calendly will be synced as long as your integration is active and you have selected a calendar.

- When you connect your Calendly account, only events created after setting up the connection will be synced into our system. Remember, syncing will occur only for the calendars you've selected.

- If you ever change your mind and remove a calendar from the connection, events from that calendar won't be synced anymore.

- If you later decide to reconnect that calendar, only new events you create in it after reconnecting will be synced. Any events you had scheduled while the calendar was disconnected won't be synced.


**Syncing Process:**

- This is a unilateral integration, meaning events are only fetched from Calendly to the system. Events created in the system will not be synced to Calendly.

- Additionally, events synced from Calendly cannot be edited in the system; modifications must be made in Calendly for accurate sync.


**Contact Creation:**

- All new events created from Calendly to the system will be treated as appointments and not blocked slots.

- This means that for each event, if a guest is found, a subsequent contact will be created for the guest(s) in the system, allowing you to run automations on it.

### How to Edit Your Selections?

- Make changes to the calendars you want to sync with the system. You can add new calendars to start syncing events or remove existing calendars to stop syncing their events.

- Save your preferences.

### **Deletion of Calendly Events if Calendar is Deselected or Account is Disconnected**

When deselecting a calendar, you'll have the option to choose whether you want to delete all synced events of that calendar from the system. Choosing yes will permanently delete all synced events, and they cannot be restored later. If you select the calendar again, only events created after the calendar was reselected will start syncing to the system.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048849039/original/SvmdP5Otnyjtt1Fi2YN9z3SQpEOOYHaJvA.jpeg?1750849503)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048849039/original/SvmdP5Otnyjtt1Fi2YN9z3SQpEOOYHaJvA.jpeg?1750849503)

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048849032/original/kibBmk900vraCQVzGlz7-M0xLEZhvJuKuw.jpeg?1750849501)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048849032/original/kibBmk900vraCQVzGlz7-M0xLEZhvJuKuw.jpeg?1750849501)

If you delete the Calendly integration altogether, you'll also have the option to delete all synced events across all calendars from the system. Similarly, choosing yes will permanently delete all synced events, and they cannot be restored later. If you reconnect your Calendly account and select the same calendars again, only events created after the calendars were reselected will start syncing to the system.

### **Limitations of Calendly Integration**

Each user can connect only one calendly account per subaccount, and the same calendly account cannot be connected across multiple users in different subaccounts. For instance, if User A has already connected their calendly account in Subaccount A, any other user won't be able to link the same calendly account in Subaccount B. However, User A can still connect his same calendly account in Subaccount B
