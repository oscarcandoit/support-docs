# **Campaign Details**

Once you complete the steps to submit the Brand Details, you will be taken to **Campaign Details** page **.**

Campaign Details page has two sub-sections:

- #### **Messaging Use Case**

- #### **User Consent**


# **1.0 Messaging use case**

Clearly describe the purpose of your SMS campaign. Specify who will receive the messages, the nature of the content, and the context in which messages will be sent. For example, _"Sending appointment reminders to clients who have opted in via our website."_

You will see two campaign fields on this page

- Use Case Description
- Sample Message #1 & #2

For detailed Messaging Use Cases refer to **[List of campaign use case types for A2P 10DLC registration.](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004618)**

## **1.1 Use Case Description**

- The **use case description field** under Messaging Use Case outlines the specific purpose and intended usage of your SMS campaign. It’s a critical requirement for approval because it informs carriers about how and why you are sending messages, ensuring compliance with regulations and transparency.

- Must explain what type of SMS the client will be sending ( _e.g., marketing messages, appointments, notifications, etc.)_.

- **Click on 'See example' in the top right to check out examples for your use case.** It's best to keep it simple. If you outline all the use cases, you will need to provide the opt-in link for each one.

- **Use Case Discription Example:**


|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Use Case Discription Example 1:** | "**This campaign sends appointment confirmations, message notifications, and offers for chiropractic adjustments to existing patients or new patients who have opted in to receive SMS notifications. The communications are sent via the website form."** |
| **Use Case Discription Example 2:** | **"This campaign targets customers who have opted in to receive marketing updates via our subscription form. Messages will include promotional discounts, new product announcements, and exclusive offers. Users can opt out anytime by replying STOP."** |

```
If you have an EIN for your company but you want to use a different brand name for your messages, you can add this sentence "We are doing DBA as [Business_Name]" in the Campaign Use Case Description for Step 3 - Campaign Details. Make sure the rest of the submission including the website matches with the DBA business name. You can register the same EIN for 10 brands max.
```

## **1.2 Sample Message**

- Sample Message #1 & #2 refers to the sample messages you provide as part of your application for A2P10DLC campaign submission. These examples demonstrate the kind of SMS content you intend to send to your audience. The goal is to give carriers a clear idea of your messaging purpose, format, and compliance with regulations.
- Sample Message must include the **lead’s name, a staff member’s name, a business name, and opt-out language** (reply STOP to unsubscribe.)
- Must provide **an example of the type of messages the client states they are sending in their description**.
- **Sample message Examples:**



|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Non-marketing messages:**<br>**Use Case:** Healthcare or service-based businesses sending appointment reminders. | **"David**, it's **Kate** from **ABC Company**. Thanks for opting in to receive SMS notifications. I just saved a time for you on Thursday, June 15, 2023, at 4:00 PM, and I'll see you then! If anything changes, just let me know. If you need to opt out, reply **STOP**." |
| **Marketing messages:**<br>**Use Case:** Healthcare or service-based businesses sending marketing or offers. | " **David**, it's **Kate** from **ABC Company**. Thanks for opting in to receive messages. Today, we are giving out a few vouchers to our past patients for a free chiropractic adjustment. Would you like one? If you need to opt out, reply **STOP**." |

- Do NOT **including custom fields or values**





|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Rejected Example:** | Hey **{{name}}**! Samuel from **\[write the client's company name here\]** here. We remember you had signed up to receive an appointment with us a little while back. When could we get you rescheduled? Reply STOP to opt out." |


**[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041434696/original/cmXTrl2qe7NoRfa-XXSa2kIg8qsf4Fhmfg.png?1739347407)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041434696/original/cmXTrl2qe7NoRfa-XXSa2kIg8qsf4Fhmfg.png?1739347407)**

# **2.0 User Consent**

- Users must clearly and willingly agree to receive messages, and the consent should specify the type of messages being sent, such as marketing, transactional, or informational.
- Ensure users are fully informed during the opt-in process. Clearly communicate:
  - The type of messages they will receive.
  - The expected frequency of the messages.
  - Any associated costs, such as standard message and data rates.

# **Campaign Vetting FAQs**

#### **What is changing?**

Starting January 26, 2023, all new US A2P 10DLC Campaign registrations (Standard, Low volume standard, and the soon-to-be-released Sole Proprietor 2.0) will be subject to a manual vetting process and be charged a one-time **$15.75 campaign verification fee** at the time of registration.

#### **Why is this change happening, and is this a LeadConnector-specific requirement?**

This is an industry-wide change to improve the Campaign Vetting process to reduce spam, fraud, and unwanted messaging and protect SMS as a trusted communications channel in the U.S. Every messaging provider who services A2P Campaigns must conduct this vetting.

**Note**: We are collecting the campaign verification fee and will pass that along without markup to our telecommunications partners. The cost is not levied by us directly.

#### **How do the new fees fit in with existing registration fees?**

The below table details the existing registration fees and new registration fees:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Sole Prop (upcoming)** | **Low Volume Standard** | **Standard** |
| **Existing Fee** |  |  |  |
| Brand registration fee (one time) | $4.2 | $4.2 | $4.2 |
| Monthly campaign fee (monthly recurring) | $2.1 | $1.5-$12 (depending on the use case type) | $1.5-$12 (depending on the use case type) |
| **New fee** |  |  |  |
| Campaign verification fee (one time) | $15.75 | $15.75 | $15.75 |

#### **How will this affect Campaign Vetting?**

With this new vetting process, a newly submitted Campaign will be put in a “Pending” state until it has been vetted and approved in the manual vetting process. Customers can only send compliant messages on the A2P route once the Campaign is fully approved.

#### **What will determine whether a Campaign passes or fails this vetting?**

To help ensure your Campaigns are approved in this vetting process, please follow these **[best practices in A2P Campaign Approval Best Practices.](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000174)**

#### **Will I get my $15.75 back if my Campaign fails to vet?**

No, the $15.75 Campaign vetting fee is non-refundable. Telephony System is working on an expedited pre-screening process to catch issues before the Campaign is sent for external vetting. We will share more news on this once we have an update.

#### **Are existing Campaigns affected by this change?**

At this time, only new Campaigns are affected by this change. If this changes for existing Campaigns, we will communicate any new vetting requirements.

#### **Are monthly recurring fees affected by this change?**

No, recurring fees remain the same and are based on the campaign use case.

#### **Do this new vetting process and $15.75 fee also extend to “post-approval” Campaigns like Agents/Franchise and Proxy? If yes, does it occur before the carrier approval, after the carrier approval, or instead of the carrier approval?**

Yes, it applies to post-approval Campaigns. It happens after carrier approval.

#### **What can I do if my campaigns are rejected?**

Contact the support team here so our LC phone specialist team will help you fix your Campaign registration / re-submit a new Campaign which will result in additional charges.

#### **Are there exceptions to these changes?**

[Toll-Free messaging](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000181) remains an attractive alternative to A2P 10DLC. Toll-Free messaging does [require a verification process](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000756) but does not rely on Brand and Campaign registration.
