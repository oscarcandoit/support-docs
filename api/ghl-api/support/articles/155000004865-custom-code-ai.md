#### Overview:

Writing custom code in workflows just got smarter, faster, and easier—thanks to AI! We’re thrilled to introduce Code with AI (Beta), enabling users to generate custom code snippets with just a simple description.

#### Previous Behaviour:

- Previously, creating custom code within workflows required users to write JavaScript code from scratch, which could be time-consuming and required programming expertise.
- Manually map input properties from previous workflow steps to use within the code.
- Test and debug code manually before implementation.
- This process demanded a significant investment of time and technical skill.

#### What’s New?

- Now we have AI-Assisted Code Generation. With Code with AI, the process is streamlined:
- AI-Powered Code Generation – Describe the desired functionality in plain language, and AI will generate JavaScript code for you.
- Automated Property Integration – AI intelligently incorporates relevant input properties based on your description.
- One-Click Implementation – Quickly review and insert AI-generated code into your workflow.
- Regenerate if Needed – Not happy with the first result? Click Generate again for a fresh version.

Pro Tip:

Be as specific as possible in your prompt for the best results!

#### How to Use It?
