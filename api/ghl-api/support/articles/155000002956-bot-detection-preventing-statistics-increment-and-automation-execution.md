### **Overview**

In the realm of email marketing, accurate metrics are crucial for understanding customer engagement and the effectiveness of your campaigns. Bots can artificially inflate your open and click rates, leading to misleading data. To combat this, we have introduced the Bot Detection Preventing Statistics Increment and Automation Execution feature.

### **What Does This Feature Do?**

This feature identifies and mitigates the impact of bots interacting with your emails. When a bot is detected opening or clicking an email, the following actions are taken:

1. **Preventing Statistics Increment**: The email open or click counter will not increment, ensuring your engagement metrics reflect only genuine user interactions.
2. **Preventing Automation Execution**: Any automation events triggered by email opens or clicks will not execute if a bot is detected, maintaining the integrity of your automated workflows.

### **How to enable/disable the Bot Detection Prevention Settings?**

**By default, the Bot Detection Preventing Statistics Increment and Automation Execution feature is turned off.**

Navigate to Settings -> Business Profile. Under the "General Section," you can find the settings Check/uncheck to enable and disable the settings
