## What is SEO Pixel?

The SEO Pixel is a small code snippet that lets us automatically apply AI-powered SEO fixes (title tags, meta descriptions, image alt text, etc.) to websites that are not hosted internally.

Until now, “Fix Issue” only worked for internal websites and funnels. With SEO Pixel, you can use the same one-click SEO automation on WordPress, Wix, custom domains, or even connected WordPress sites where the pixel is not automatically detected.

> The **pixel code installation isn't necessary for internal sites**. If you **skip the pixel code installation step (for websites hosted within the CRM)**, the **“Fix Issue” button will still work** and apply the fixes directly to your internal website.

> If that’s not working as expected, please reach out to the support team so we can investigate further.

## Who Should Use It?

- Agencies managing external websites (WordPress, Shopify, Wix, etc.).

- Users with WordPress sites connected to the CRM where the pixel isn’t detected.


## How It Works

1. Check Site Type

   - If your site is hosted internally → use Fix Issue normally.

   - If your site is external or missing the pixel → you’ll see a banner: “SEO Pixel not detected.”
2. Install the Pixel

   - Click View Installation Steps. SEO Pixel.

   - Copy the unique code snippet generated on your SEO screen.

   - Paste it into your website’s body. (platform-specific instructions provided).
3. Verify & Apply Fixes

   - After pasting, reopen the SEO page and click your website again, this will trigger a new installation check.

   - Then click Verify Installation.

   - Once verified, you can apply SEO fixes with Fix Issue, we’ll update your site automatically via the pixel.

## Common Questions

Do I need this if my site is hosted internally?

No. SEO fixes for internal sites work automatically. You only need the pixel for external sites or if your connected WordPress site doesn’t detect it.

Will it slow down my site?

No. The pixel loads asynchronously and won’t block page speed.

What if I move my site to another sub-account?

If the pixel is already installed, it will continue working.

Can I undo fixes?

Yes. Go to Fixed Issues in the SEO tool and revert anytime.

## Key Notes

- Pixel code is unique per site and generated inside the SEO screen.

- Only SEO fixes are applied — the pixel does not change speed, design, or performance.


## Next Steps

1. Open the SEO tool.

2. If you see the SEO Pixel not detected banner, click View Installation steps.

3. Follow the platform steps above to paste your code.

4. Verify installation and start fixing SEO issues automatically.
