## **Billing adjustments**

For pricing plan changes that are done in the middle of the billing cycle, the billing adjustments are calculated on a pro-rated basis. These can be either additional charges or refunds based on whether you are upgrading or downgrading the plan. The billing adjustments are adjusted in the next billing cycle.
