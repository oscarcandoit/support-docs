## **Description**

You can only send SMS messages from a phone number, Alphanumeric Sender ID, or short code that has been provisioned or ported into your **LeadConnector** account. The phone number must be SMS-capable. For short codes, the sender's number must be based in the same country as the recipient's number.

To check your available phone numbers and their capabilities, visit the **Phone Numbers** section in your **Account Settings.**

* * *

## **Possible Causes**

- The phone number you're trying to use may not support SMS messaging.

- The phone number might be formatted incorrectly. **LeadConnector** requires numbers to be in **E.164 format** (e.g., +12345678900).

- If using a short code, it must be registered for use in the **same country** as the message recipient.

- The phone number may still be in the process of being **ported or hosted**, and not yet fully active.

- The number may not belong to the account that’s being used to send the SMS.


* * *

## **Possible Solutions**

- Make sure the number you’re using is SMS-capable. You can verify this by checking your numbers under **Settings > Phone Numbers.**

- Confirm the number is formatted in **E.164 international standard format**.

- When using a short code, ensure that both the sending and receiving numbers are located in the **same country**.

- If the number is being ported or hosted into **LeadConnector**, please confirm that the transfer process has been completed. You can track this in your **Phone Numbers > Porting Requests** section.
