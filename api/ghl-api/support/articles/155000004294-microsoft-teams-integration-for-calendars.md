### **Important Notes**

- ### Connecting an Outlook calendar does not automatically link Microsoft Teams. To connect Teams, navigate to **Calendar Connections > Video Conferencing** and connect it separately.

- To view appointments on your Outlook calendar, ensure that your desired Outlook calendar is both connected and selected as the linked calendar. You can do this under **Calendar Connections > Calendars**.

* * *

### **Limitations with Microsoft Teams Integration**

- Only Microsoft Teams accounts for Work and School (Organisation and Education) are eligible for integration.
- Each user can connect only one Microsoft Teams integration per subaccount.
- The same Microsoft Teams integration can be used across multiple subaccounts, but only for the same user. For example, if User A has connected their Microsoft Teams integration in Subaccount A, then only User A can connect that same integration to Subaccount B.

### **FAQs**

**Q: Which Calendars Support Dynamic Microsoft Teams Links?**

A: **Personal Booking**, **Round Robin**, **Collective Calendars, and Service Calendars** support Microsoft Teams integration and automatically generate new Teams links for each appointment booked. This feature is coming soon for Class Booking Calendars.

**Q: How Can I Use Microsoft Teams with Event Calendars?**

A: You can use Microsoft Teams with **Event Calendars** by manually generating a Teams meeting link and adding it to the calendar settings.

**Steps:**

1. Generate a meeting link in **Microsoft Teams**.
2. In the calendar settings, select **Custom** as the meeting location.
3. Paste the generated Teams link.

**Note**: This will add a static link, meaning the same link will be used for all future bookings.
