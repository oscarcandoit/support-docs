## Overview

To help you maintain compliance and protect your messaging reputation, we’ve updated the SMS compliance settings for sender ID and opt-out language. These updates ensure that the first message in every conversation—including Missed Call Text-Back (MCTB) and review requests—includes sender identification information and opt-out language, unless already present.

Here’s what’s new in the SMS compliance experience:

- **Mandatory Inclusion**: The first message in any SMS conversation (including MCTB and review requests) will automatically include sender ID information and opt-out language (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”) if it’s not already included.
- **Trial Mode Restriction**: Agencies in trial mode cannot disable the sender ID and opt-out checkboxes in the SMS Compliance settings.
- **New Location Restriction**: Locations created within the last 15 days cannot disable the sender ID and opt-out checkboxes.
- **User Restrictions**: Account Users and Admins no longer have the ability to disable the checkboxes for sending sender information and opt-out language.
- **Opt-Out Logic**: Opt-out language will only be added if the message does not already contain opt-out wording (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe” or similar).
- **UI Improvements**: We’ve made user interface updates to the SMS Compliance tab under Advanced Settings for a clearer and more intuitive experience.

These changes ensure compliance, reduce the risk of messaging restrictions, and streamline your SMS operations.

## How to Access and Configure SMS Compliance Settings

Follow these steps to review or customize your SMS compliance settings for sender ID and opt-out language:

1. **Navigate to Phone System Settings**:
   - Log in to your sub-account.
   - Go to the **Phone Numbers** page in settings.
   - Click on **Advanced Settings** in the top menu.
2. **Locate SMS Compliance**:
   - Under the Advanced Settings tab, find the **SMS Compliance** section.
3. **Review the Options**:
   - You’ll see two checkboxes under “SMS Compliance Customizations and Opt-Out”:
     - **Make SMS compliant by adding an opt-out message**: This ensures every first message includes opt-out language (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”). The default text is “Reply STOP to unsubscribe,” but you can customize it by clicking the **Customize** button.
     - **Make SMS compliant by adding sender information**: This adds sender identification (e.g., your business name or contact info) to the first message. The default text is “Thanks, \[YourName\] at \[YourBusiness\],” but you can customize it by clicking the **Customize** button.
   - Note: If your message already includes opt-out language or sender info, we won’t duplicate it.
4. **Understand Restrictions**:
   - If you’re in trial mode, an agency, or managing a location less than 15 days old, you cannot disable these checkboxes. This ensures compliance during critical setup periods.
   - Account Users and Admins also cannot disable these options, maintaining consistency across your account.
5. **Customize Text (If Allowed)**:
   - Click the **Customize** button next to each checkbox to edit the default text for opt-out messages or sender information.
   - Ensure your custom text meets regulatory requirements (e.g., clear opt-out instructions like “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”).
6. **Save Changes**:
   - After making adjustments, save your settings to apply them to your SMS communications.

## Why These Changes Matter

- **Compliance**: Adding sender ID and opt-out language helps you adhere to A2P 10DLC regulations, preventing messaging restrictions or penalties from carriers.
- **User Trust**: Clear sender information and opt-out options build trust with recipients, improving engagement and reducing complaints.
- **Automation Safety**: Features like Missed Call Text-Back and review requests are now automatically compliant, saving you time and effort.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Q: Can I disable sender ID or opt-out language?

A: No, if you’re in trial mode, managing a location less than 15 days old, or an Account User/Admin, you cannot disable these options. This is to ensure compliance during critical setup phases. Agencies and established locations may have more flexibility.

### Q: What happens if my message already has opt-out language?

A: We will not add duplicate opt-out language. It checks the message content and only appends the required text if it’s missing.

### Q: How do I customize the opt-out or sender text?

A: Click the **Customize** button next to each checkbox in the SMS Compliance section to edit the default text. Ensure your custom text is clear, concise, and meets regulatory standards (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”).

### Q: What if I don’t see the Customize button?

A: If the button is unavailable, it’s likely due to restrictions (e.g., trial mode, new location, or user permissions). Contact your account owner/admin or agency support for assistance.
