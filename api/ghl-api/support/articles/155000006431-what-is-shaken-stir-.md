## **Overview**

SHAKEN/STIR is a set of protocols designed to authenticate caller ID information and verify that it is coming from a legitimate source. It uses **digital certificates** to validate your ownership of the phone number, ensuring carriers can trust that your calls are genuine.

When enabled, your calls are more likely to display as a **“Trusted Call”**, improving the chance that recipients pick up.

**SHAKEN/STIR** registration helps you increase the call completion and call answer rates by verifying your ownership of the phone number.

## **Why SHAKEN/STIR Matters**

- Boosts call completion and answer rates

- Helps prevent caller ID spoofing and fraud

- May display a “Trusted Call” label on outgoing calls

- Does not remove nuisance labels


## **Requirements**

   - Your phone numbers are **automatically enrolled** in SHAKEN/STIR.

   - This applies to all new A2P applications submitted after **April 23, 2025**, and older sub-accounts are also being updated automatically.
