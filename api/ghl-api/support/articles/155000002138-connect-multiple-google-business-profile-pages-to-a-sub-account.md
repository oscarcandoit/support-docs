### **How to Connect Multiple Google Business Profile Pages**

#### **Navigate to Integrations:**

To connect your Google Business Profile (GBP) pages, visit the Integrations page located under Sub-Account Settings. Proceed to the GBP Integrations section.

**Note:** If you cannot see the Google Business Profile option on the Integrations page, please ensure your Google account is connected. This step is essential and precedes the connection of GBP pages to your sub-account.

#### **Configure GBP Messaging:**

GBP messaging enables you to retrieve messages sent to your GBP page directly into your CRM. These messages are sent by customers via the GBP page chat. You can enable or disable GBP messaging for the selected pages according to your preference. It's possible to enable GBP messaging for all selected pages or customize settings as needed.

#### **Enable Call Tracking:**

You may choose to enable call tracking for a GBP page based on your preferences. Please note that call tracking can only be enabled for a single page at a sub-account level and only at one sub-account level per page.
