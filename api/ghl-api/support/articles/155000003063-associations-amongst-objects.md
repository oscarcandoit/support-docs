## ``` Currently we support association of contacts to other contacts or custom objects. Also - we support association of custom objects with any other custom objects. ```

## Creating Associations

#### Steps to Create Associations:

1. **Access the Custom Objects Section:**

   - Navigate to **Subaccounts > Settings >  Objects**.
   - Select the object you wish to create an association for.
   - Click on the **Associations** tab.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155030887096/original/psdMFSbIyXp9g7J6t5WQ2MapKw8Yq5prDw.png?1723474138)
2. **Set Up Labels:**
   - You can choose to set a single label or a pair of labels to define the relationship.
   - Example: For associating a car with its owner, you might set the labels as “Owner” and “Car."

```
All current associations are many-to-many in nature.
```

1. **Save and Apply:**

- After naming and setting up the association labels, click **Save**.
- You can now use these labels to associate records in your custom objects or between a custom object and a contact.

```
You can create upto 10 association labels between two contacts or between a contact-to-custom object combination
```

## Managing Associations

1. **View Associations:**

   - Go to the record details of the object.
   - On the right side panel, you will find the associations listed under the **Related Objects** section.

3. **Removing Associations:**

   - If needed, you can remove an association by selecting the association label, clicking on the kebab menu (3 dots icon) and selecting delete
   - Type "DELETE" in the text box and then click the **delete** button.
   - Note that the delete action can only be performed if there are no existing relations between two different records using the mentioned label.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155030887208/original/c4koMP5LeC548R6-dUN47agKEc61E_6I3w.png?1723474187)
