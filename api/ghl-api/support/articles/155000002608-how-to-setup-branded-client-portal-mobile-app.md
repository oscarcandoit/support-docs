## Prerequisites

1. **D-U-N-S Number**:

To obtain an organizational developer account, a D-U-N-S Number is required. You can apply for one using the following website:

[Get a D-U-N-S Number](https://www.dnb.com/duns/get-a-duns.html)

If the process is taking too long, you can contact D-U-N-S support to potentially expedite the process:

[D-U-N-S Support](https://www.dnb.com/duns/get-a-duns.html)

2. **Organizational Developer Accounts**: We require organizational developer accounts to proceed with app development. Please provide us with both Google and Apple developer accounts.



\- Google Developer Account: Ensure the Google developer account is verified; otherwise, apps cannot be published. If you encounter issues creating the account, please contact Google Support, as they can assist you.



\- Apple Developer Account: After creating your account and logging in, visit App Store Connect to complete the required legal documents. Registering as an EU trader is necessary if you plan to distribute apps in the EU region. Select "I am a trader" under the Digital Services Act (DSA) to proceed, which will require additional documentation. If EU distribution is not needed, select "No, I am not a trader." If you face any difficulties creating the Apple Developer account, contact Apple Support for assistance in expediting or resolving the process.

3. **App Description and Content Guidelines**: Ensure that all app descriptions, carousel image descriptions, carousel images, and splash screen images do not contain financial terms such as "paid," "free," or "premium subscription." Additionally, avoid using these terms in any URLs, including those for support, terms and conditions, and privacy policy. Failure to comply with these guidelines will prevent the app from being published.

### Step 2: Business Profile

  - It's necessary to register for a Google Developer account in order to upload Android apps. Your Developer account is where you'll submit, as well as manage your apps. It costs a one-time fee of $25.

  - We recommend setting up a second Google account for this purpose, so you can separate it from your other Google services (Gmail, Google Drive, Google+, etc.) if you already have a personal account.

    How-To:

  - [Register for an Android Develop account here](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/)

  - You'll need to log into the Google account you'd like to use.

  - You'll be taken through a 4-step registration process. Check the agreement box and click Continue to payment.
