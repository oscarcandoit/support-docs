## **Brief summary of the video**

This video explains how to create and set up a Meta (formerly Facebook) Business Manager account. Once done, it talks about creating an Ad account within the newly created Business Manager and add a payment method to the ad account.

1. ### **What is Meta Business Manager?**


   - It’s a tool for managing your business’s Facebook and Instagram pages, ad accounts, and other assets (like pixels) from one place. **You need a personal Facebook account to create a business manager.**
2. ### **Steps to Set Up:**


   - **Step 1:** Visit [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com/) to create an account.
   - **Step 2:** Use your business name and email when setting up.
   - **Step 3:** Add your assets like your Facebook Page, Instagram account, and ad accounts. You can also invite team members to help manage.
3. ### **Verifying Your Business:**


   - To reduce the chance of restrictions or bans, it’s recommended to verify your business. This is different from verifying your Facebook or Instagram page; it verifies that your business is real.
   - To verify, go to **Business Settings > Business Info**, enter your business details (like legal name and address), and match them with your official documents.
   - Upload these legal documents to complete the verification process. This makes it easier to recover your account if something goes wrong in the future.
4. ### **Verifying via Facebook Developer Tools:**


   - If the verification button doesn’t show up immediately, use a workaround by creating a dummy app in Facebook’s developer portal. This will prompt Facebook to ask you to verify your business.
   - Once verified, your business manager account will be marked as legitimate.
5. ### **Conclusion:**


   - By verifying your business, you reduce the risk of account issues and can manage your assets more securely. The video also offers a free community for more marketing tips and strategies.

In short: This summary helps you in setting up and securing a Meta Business Manager account, helping you avoid future issues when managing ads or social media assets.
