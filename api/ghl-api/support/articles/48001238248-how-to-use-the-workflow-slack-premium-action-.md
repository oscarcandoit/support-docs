## **What is the Slack Notification Premium Action?**

Workflow Slack Premium Action is an advanced communication feature designed to automate and streamline messaging within Slack, a widely-used team collaboration tool. This feature allows users to send targeted messages to specific users, private or public channels within their Slack workspace. A user-friendly interface and customizable options ensure effective communication by enabling users to set up and schedule notifications based on their needs.

The action offers three main events:

Sending a message to a user: Users can choose from four options to send a direct message to the right person: Assigned User, Custom Email, Internal User, or Slack User. Each option serves a unique purpose in determining the Message's recipient, ensuring accurate and efficient communication.

Sending a message to a private channel: Users can select a private channel within their workspace to send messages, which will appear as if sent manually by the User who created the Slack integration. This allows for secure communication within a select group of team members.

Sending a message to a public channel: Users can choose a public channel within their workspace to broadcast messages, making information accessible to all workspace members.

# **How to use the Workflow Slack Premium Action?**

The action offers three main events:

- Sending a message to a user
- Sending a message to a public channel
- Sending a message to a private channel

## **Send Direct Message to a User**

You will have four options if the event is Send Direct Message to User.

- **Assigned User** \- Assigned User of the Contact
- **Custom Email** \- Add a specific email to search your Slack Workspace for the User and then send out the Message
- **Internal User** \- Users from your account
- **Slack User** \- Directly search your Slack Workspace Users by name.

### **Different Types of User Sources & their use cases**

#### **Assigned User (of contact)**

This is used to send out notifications for the assigned User of the contact. In this case, the User's email (in settings>My Staff> User Info) for the User Assigned to the contact is used to find the Slack user.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294303906/original/DwaE0uTM0gH3TJA7ZfQrXIKoc7INo7ap0g.png?1682417524)

#### **Custom Email**

This is used for all the cases where you need a dynamic user to send notifications to. The custom email that is filled in is used to find the matching of a Slack user.

This is for all those cases where you do not have the User predefined. Either type in the email or select from a list of custom variables using the custom variable picker.

#### **Internal User**

Use this option to send a message to one of the account users. You were typically used to send notifications to particular users responsible for certain sections of your business. Say, sending out information on a successful opportunity won to your finance head. The email of the Internal User selected is used to find the Slack user here.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294304335/original/6XgtbynGcZQqTDwli0fmJEEuI0Z7PiEmbw.png?1682417684)

#### **Slack User**

This is as simple as it sounds. Send a direct message to any Slack user of your workspace.

**Please note:**

```

This will keep searching until you have the required user found. If the user is at the bottom of the list, you might have to hit the load more button several times. This is only for the workspaces having more than 1000 users.

```

**Please note:**

```
Slack allows only limited number of Public Channels to be fetched at once. So if you don't see the desired channel by typing out the name, please hit the load more button. This will keep searching until you have the required channel found. If the channel is in the bottom of the list you might have to hit the load more button a couple of times. This is only for the workspaces having more than 1000 channels.

**Please Note:**

```
It's important to be aware that when sending messages to a Private Channel, these messages will be sent as the User who created that Slack Integration, not as the Bot. Therefore, it will appear as if it was sent manually by the User itself.

Slack allows only limited number of Private Channels to be fetched at once. So if you don't see the desired channel by typing out the name, please hit the load more button. This will keep searching until you have the required channel found. If the channel is in the bottom of the list you might have to hit the load more button a couple of times. This is only for the workspaces having more than 1000 channels.
