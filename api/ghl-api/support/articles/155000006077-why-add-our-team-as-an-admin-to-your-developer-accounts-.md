To publish and maintain your mobile app, our team requires access to your developer accounts (Apple App Store Connect and Google Play Console). Adding our team email as an **Admin** ensures:

- **Seamless App Publishing**: We can submit builds, update app versions, and manage releases on your behalf.

- **Faster Approvals**: Direct access avoids back-and-forth with credentials, reducing delays in review and publishing.

- **App Maintenance**: We can quickly respond to compliance changes, fix rejected builds, and update certificates/keys.

- **Ongoing Support**: We can manage permissions, troubleshoot errors, and ensure your app remains live and compliant.

- **Security Best Practice**: Instead of sharing your personal login, Admin access keeps accounts secure and auditable.

## How to add the provided email as an Admin

### ? For **Apple App Store Connect**

1. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login).

2. Navigate to **Users and Access** from the main dashboard.

3. Click the **“+” (Add)** button.

4. Enter the team email:

**>\> \[Insert the email -  appletestkb@gmail.com\]**

5. Assign the role **Admin**(full permissions required to manage apps).

6. Click **Invite**.

7. The team will receive an email invitation — once accepted, we’ll have access to manage your app.

### ? For **Google Play Console**

1. Log in to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/signup).

2. From the left-hand menu, go to **Users and Permissions**.

3. Click **Invite New User**.

4. Enter the team email:

**>\> \[Insert the email -  appletestkb@gmail.com\]**

5. Under **Role**, select **Admin**(to allow app publishing & management).

6. Check **App Permissions → All Apps** so we can manage every app in your account.

7. Click **Invite User**.

8. The team will accept the invite and gain access.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always grant **Admin** access (not just Developer) to ensure we can handle publishing, certificates, billing, and compliance tasks.

- Do **not** share your personal login credentials — invites are the secure method.

- If you ever need to revoke access, you can remove the team email from your console.

? Adding us as Admin early helps prevent launch delays and ensures smooth app operations.
