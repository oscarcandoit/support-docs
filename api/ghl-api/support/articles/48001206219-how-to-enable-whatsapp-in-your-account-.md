## **Restrictions for WhatsApp Business Sign-Up**

When signing up for the **WhatsApp Business Platform**, businesses must adhere to the following restrictions:

1️⃣ **New Phone Number Requirement**

    •    **Existing numbers** that are **currently active** on WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business App **cannot** be used for signup.

## **FAQs**

## Q. I received an error message stating that the number is registered to an existing WhatsApp account. What should I do next?

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155027471137/original/kPQIZh_lGyO51atsprXMwaxLZ8SPwhgItA.png?1718111947)

**Answer:**

This error usually occurs in two situations:

1. **Active WhatsApp Account on Your Mobile Device:**

If you currently have an active WhatsApp account on your mobile device, you need to delete that account to connect with the chat account. Follow these steps:
   - Open the WhatsApp app.
   - Navigate to Settings > Account > Delete my account.
   - _Note:_ After integration, you will not be able to use WhatsApp on your phone, and your previous conversation history and contacts will not be migrated

2. **WhatsApp Number Connected to Another Provider:**

If your WhatsApp number is linked to another provider, you need to create a new WABA account and migrate your number to the new WABA account

## Q. You have already linked the maximum number of phone numbers allowed for this business account. Delete a phone number to continue or request additional numbers.

Meta allows you to have only two phone numbers per WABA account

## FAQ :

## Q. I am getting Message Undeliverable error

Reasons can include:

- The recipient phone number is not a WhatsApp phone number.
- Sending an authentication template to a WhatsApp user who has a +91 country calling code (India). Authentication templates currently cannot be sent to WhatsApp users in India.
- The message was not delivered to create a high quality user experience. See Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits.

## Q. Failed to send a message because this user's phone number is part of an experiment

Starting June 14, 2023, roughly 1% of WhatsApp users will not receive marketing template messages from any business unless one of the following conditions is met:

- a [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#customer-service-windows) exists between the customer and the business
- an open [marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#conversation-categories) exists between the customer and the business
- an open [free-entry point conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#free-entry-point-conversations) exists between the customer and the business

If you send a marketing template message to a customer who is part of the experiment group, your message will not be sent and you will not be billed for it since no conversation was created

## Q. Can I use an LC/Twilio number on WhatsApp even if my A2P 10DLC registration is incomplete?

Yes, you can use the number to register on WhatsApp. However, it is highly recommended that you complete the A2P 10DLC registration for better compliance and reliability.

## Q. Customers are not able to see my Business name on their WhatsApp app, instead they are seeing the phone number
