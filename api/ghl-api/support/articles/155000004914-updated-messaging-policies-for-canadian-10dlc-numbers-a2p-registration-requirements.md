To align with industry standards, we are updating our messaging policies concerning Canadian 10-digit long code (10DLC) numbers.These changes pertain to messages sent from Canadian numbers to recipients in both the United States and Canada.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Messaging from Canada to the United States:**

   - Effective immediately, all messages sent from Canadian 10DLC numbers to U.S. recipients must originate from Application-to-Person (A2P) registered numbers. This requirement applies to both new and existing Canadian numbers.
2. **Messaging within Canada:**

   - For new Canadian 10DLC numbers purchased after 26th March 2025, A2P registration is mandatory to send messages to Canadian recipients.

   - Existing Canadian 10DLC numbers used for messaging within Canada are not required to undergo A2P registration at this time, except as noted in point 1.

**Important Notes:**

- These updates apply exclusively to 10DLC numbers. Toll-Free (TF) numbers are not affected and will continue to operate under existing guidelines.


**Understanding A2P 10DLC Registration:**

A2P 10DLC is a system that allows businesses to send Application-to-Person type messaging via standard 10-digit long code phone numbers.Registering your numbers under this framework helps ensure compliance with carrier regulations and enhances message deliverability.For a comprehensive overview of A2P 10DLC and answers to common questions, please refer to our [support article.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002380-what-is-a2p-10-dlc-brand-and-campaign-registration-summary-and-faqs)

**Action Steps:**

- **For Existing Canadian 10DLC Numbers Messaging to the U.S.:** If your number is not yet A2P registered, please initiate the registration process promptly to comply with the new requirements.

- **For New Canadian 10DLC Numbers:** Ensure A2P registration is completed before initiating messaging to recipients in either the U.S. or Canada.

- **For Toll-Free Numbers:** No action is required; existing policies remain in effect.
