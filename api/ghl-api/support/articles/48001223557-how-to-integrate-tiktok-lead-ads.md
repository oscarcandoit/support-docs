TikTok has become one of the fastest-growing social media platforms. Its popularity has increased exponentially over the last couple of years.

The company has recently announced its intention to launch a new advertising program called TikTok Leads. This new feature allows advertisers to target their ads directly at TikTok users who have already expressed interest in their brand or service.

In this article, we will cover how to integrate TikTok Ads into the CRM.

For information on how to set up TikTok Lead Ads please refer to their [User Guide](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10010204)

The workflow should have the Workflow trigger step **Contact Created** and it must have an **if/else condition** added to it which searches for **Contact Details> Source> is> TikTok**

**Please Note**

```
Make sure to write TikTok exactly like this as the Source attribution is case sensitive.
```

## **Troubleshooting**

### **I** **see an error message No pages for this account, what should I do?**

If you come across this error while integrating your business account please make sure you have created an instant form in your Tikttok business account, please follow [these steps.](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9525)

### **My TikTok 'Access Token' is expired what should I do?**

If you see your access token is expired please disconnect your account from the CRM integration page. Once you re-integrated the CRM will generate a new access token. if you continue to have this issue please notify the support.

### **I changed a question on my Lead Ad Form during a live campaign, what should I do?**

Let's say you just updated your lead ad form within TikTok to capture a new desired response. You will need to head back into your sub-account settings and make sure you [create a custom field for the new desired response](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223557-how-to-integrate-tiktok-leads-ads#Step-3%3A%C2%A0Map-Fields-and-or-create-Custom-Fields). Once this is complete head back into the ' **TikTok Form Fields Mapping tab**' hit the edit button and select the new custom field you had just created.

If you want to stop all inbound leads just toggle the status off:

### **Can the same TikTok account ID be connected to multiple sub accounts in HL (same agency or across different agencies) without issues?**

Yes as long as both accounts have the TikTok Form fields mapped.

### **What are all the permissions on TikTok that the person who connects the integration will need to maintain so that the integration token does not expire?**

Only LeadConnector needs to be granted permissions and that is taken care of when the integration is connected. User permissions and access are not an issue.

### **What would cause the integration token to expire and how can we minimize it on our side to assure a stable integration?**

Tiktok grants the CRM a permanent access token so the integration should remain intact unless broken off by the user manually. We will be displaying an Integration expired message under the TikTok integration option in settings> Integration
