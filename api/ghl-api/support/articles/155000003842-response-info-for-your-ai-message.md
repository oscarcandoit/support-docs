### **Introducing AI Message Details in Conversations**

The **AI Message Details** feature allows users to view the components involved in generating AI responses, providing deeper insights into how the AI constructs its messages. Users can also edit the knowledge base and other data sources directly from the conversation view, ensuring accuracy and improving AI performance through real-time feedback.

This feature enhances **transparency, user control, and AI reliability** by allowing users to:

✔ Understand how AI-generated responses are constructed.

✔ View and modify knowledge base data used in responses.

✔ Track relevant chat history and function calls involved in AI message generation.

**Key Highlights (How it works):**

Once an AI message is generated, users can open the **AI Message Details** sidebar/modal to view:

- The **AI-generated response** and its full context.
- **Prompt, Intent, and Knowledge Base/Data Sources** used to generate the response.
- **Chat History**—a list of relevant past conversations that were taken into consideration to generate the AI's response.
- **Action Execution History**—a breakdown of all actions executed to external services (e.g., fetching calendar appointments).
- **Agent Preview**—view the agent name responsible for processing AI responses.

### **Step 1: Click on the Response Info Icon as shown in the Image**

#### **Agent Preview (New Feature)**

- Displays the **agent name** responsible for handling the AI response.

- An editable text box will either open or be available right away.
- Make the necessary changes and **save**.
- The edits are immediately reflected in the knowledge base, ensuring the AI uses updated information in future responses![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034135573/original/IIhTPBu1wlJ8xYCjKAwh0jBkFXy9lQcBVg.png?1728067995)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034135673/original/Tx9ZtNhqqAa-JrqiwGqj3lPbSN8L8r2SQQ.png?1728068210)

```
Note: If knowledge base is used for AI response, only then the data chunks (website & FAQs) will be shown in the sidebar
```

```
If an FAQ is updated it will recreate the FAQ, deleting the previous one
```

### **Additional Information**

- **Visibility**: This sidebar is accessible for all AI messages, AI workflow actions, and bot trial messages.
- **Tagging Edited Information**: If a knowledge base website information is modified, an "Edited" tag will appear next to the trained website with a tooltip indicating the update.
- **FAQ & Website Updates**: Modifying FAQs will update the existing trained FAQ in real time. Post update, FAQ utilized in the AI message will be shown as deleted.
- If the website info is updated, It will reflect the updated data in the scraped data modal, with "Edited" tag beside the URL.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034136149/original/LQhlMK1RyTq-ig0Rg_IfXYy3I3VsLQHJCA.png?1728069376)
