**Please Note:**

```
Currency locale refers to the regional settings and conventions used to display currency values, taking into account the local formatting rules, symbols, and language preferences. It determines how currency values are formatted and presented based on the region or country where the currency is being used.

For example, the currency locale for the United States uses the US Dollar symbol ($) and formats currency values with a comma as the thousands separator and a period as the decimal separator (e.g., $1,234.56). In contrast, the currency locale for Germany uses the Euro symbol (€) and formats currency values with a period as the thousands separator and a comma as the decimal separator (e.g., €1.234,56).

Using the correct currency locale ensures that your customers or users can easily understand and interpret currency values, as they will be presented in a familiar and expected format.

For example, if you set the Lower Range to 1 and the Upper Range to 100, the Random Number action will generate a random number between 1 and 100, inclusive.
