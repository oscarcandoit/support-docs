In this guide, we will walk you through how to set up workflow automation for your LinkedIn lead ads integration.

## **Pre-requisite**

Please connect your Linkedin account with the CRM. To know more about how to connect Linkedin with the CRM, [click here](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001151-integrating-linkedin-lead-ads-with-crm)

## **Add Workflow Trigger**

- Go to "Automation" on the left menu and click on "Create Workflow."

- Click on "Add a new trigger" and select the "LinkedIn lead form submitted" trigger.

- Use filters to select a page/ad account (if you've added multiple ad accounts to the subaccount). If you can't see any ad accounts in the dropdown, ensure your LinkedIn account is integrated with the sub-account.

- Use filters to select a specific form. Ensure that field mapping is completed for the chosen form; otherwise, the leads won't be fetched into the CRM.

- Once the automation setup is complete, publish the workflow to activate it.
