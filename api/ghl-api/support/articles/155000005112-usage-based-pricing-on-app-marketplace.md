## **What does the usage-based price apply for?**

An app can have usage-based price for three modules:

1. A per-execution price for Marketplace Actions and Triggers.
2. A per-message price for Conversation Providers. They can set a custom price for inbound and outbound messages.
3. A custom per-usage price for events that are app-specific and billed using the Marketplace billing APIs. For example, an app that offers AI Voice calling agents can bill a per-minute price using the Marketplace billing APIs.

## **Where can I see the app's usage-based charges?**

If an app has usage-based pricing, the pricing details will be listed in the pricing section of the App details page.

Further, for Workflow Actions and Triggers, the per-execution pricing is also listed in the Discover tab in the Workflow builder.
