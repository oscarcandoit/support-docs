Learn how email templates now work safely in workflows—no more unintentional global changes when editing.

### **What Changed?**

Previously, editing an email action based on a template would update the template and all other actions using it.

- **OLD FLOW :**

- Change to one email action affects EVERYTHING
- Template gets updated
- All other email actions get updated too
- **NEW FLOW :**

- Change stays local to that email action only
- Template remain unchanged
- All other email actions remain unchanged

### **What’s the New (and Better) Way?**

Now, when you **add an email action using a template**, here's what happens:

1. **A copy** of the template is created, specific to that email action.

2. You can safely edit this copy—changes affect **only this email action**.

3. You can modify the subject, content, or save it as a new version— **no risk of editing the original**.


This means:

- You get the benefits of using templates **as a starting point**.

- You don’t affect other actions or the original template.

- You can make quick edits without cluttering your template list.


### **Want to Update Multiple Emails at Once?**

If you want to make **global changes** to a template that is used in multiple email actions:

1. Go to **Email → Templates** under marketing

2. Edit the original template.

3. Click on three dots, click on sync changes **“Sync Changes”**.

4. Select the email actions that should receive this update.

5. Click **“Sync Changes”** again to apply.


> ? Note: This will replace the full content in each selected email with the updated template. It is not a partial sync.

### **FAQs**

**Q: What if I don’t use a template to create an email action?**

No change! Your email action stays exactly as you created it.

**Q: What happens to old workflows and email actions created before this change?**

Those actions still work the same way. If you edit one of those emails now, a **new copy will be created** automatically to prevent affecting others.

**Q: Can I still reuse templates?**

Yes! Templates are still a great way to start creating emails. Just know that every new use creates a safe, editable copy.
