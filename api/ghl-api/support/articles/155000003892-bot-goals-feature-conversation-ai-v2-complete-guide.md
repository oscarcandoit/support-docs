## Introduction

The **Bot Goals** feature is a comprehensive update to the existing **Configure Intent** feature within the conversation AI newer version. In this feature you will be able to edit or update prompts for new or existing bots.

Additional sub-features like **Trigger a Workflow** and **Update Contact Info** will be included soon, offering more customisation and functionality.

Additionally, the former **Bot Trial** feature has been integrated under the name **Test Your Bot**, providing a unified experience within the Bot Goals feature.

## Key Changes in the New Version

- **Support for Multiple Bots:** Unlike the previous version, which only supported a single bot, the updated version allows you to create **multiple bots**. This enables you to tailor bots for specific purposes, such as General Q&A, Appointment Booking, and more.
  - Example: You can create one bot for handling general queries and another bot dedicated solely to appointment scheduling.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accessing the Bot Goals Feature

- To begin, either create a new bot or edit an existing bot.
- If you’re creating a new bot, make sure to **assign a name** to it before proceeding.

### Step 2: Navigating the Bot Interface

Once you’ve created or selected your bot, you will see three tabs:

- **Bot Settings:** This remains the same as the previous version, with no functional changes.
- **Bot Training:** Similar to Bot Settings, there are no changes to this section.
- **Bot Goals:** This is the new feature introduced in the latest version, which includes sub-features like - Trigger a workflow, Update contact info (coming soon) for customising your bot's behaviour.

- ```
The Bot Trial feature that was previously located in a separate tab is now integrated into the Bot Training or Bot Goals sections.
```

### Step 3: Customising Your Bot Goals

- In the **Bot Goals** tab, you can access the **Prompt** section, where you can add or update the AI prompts as per your goals.
- For each goal you want the bot to achieve, you'll need to create a new bot and a corresponding prompt.
  - If you're setting up a prompt for a new goal, you’ll need to create a new bot and customise the prompt in that bot’s **Bot Goals** section.

#### Sub-Features within Bot Goals

There are three primary sub-features under **Bot Goals**:

1. **Appointment Booking:** A new sub-feature, **Transfer Employee Post Appointment Booking**, has been added within the **Appointment Booking** section. This enhancement allows users to seamlessly transfer the conversation to a different bot once the intended action—such as successfully booking an appointment—has been completed.

Users can select the next bot from a dropdown list, ensuring that the conversation continues smoothly with the appropriate bot,

2. **Trigger a Workflow:** This allows you to automate actions by linking workflows to specific conversation conditions.

3. **Add Contact Info:** This feature helps you update or add contact details for leads directly through AI interactions


You can access detailed help documents for each of these sub-features by clicking the respective links within the platform.

### Step 4: Finalising the Bot

- Once you’ve updated the prompts and configured the bot as needed, click **Save**.
- Your newly created or updated bot will then go live, ready to enhance user interactions with the features and prompts you've set up.
