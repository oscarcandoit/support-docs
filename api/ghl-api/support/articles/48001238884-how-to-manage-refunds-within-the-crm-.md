This is happening probably because the refund does not meet the critRefundith the payment provider. Authorize.net would only allow refunding transactions after 24 hours from the transaction time.

Please refer to your payment provider's guidelines or contact their support team to clarify refunding older transactions.

### **Is there a limit to the number of refunds I can process daily?**

A5: There is typically no fixed limit to the number of refunds you can process daily. However, it's essential to check with your payment provider to confirm if they have any specific limitations or requirements for processing refunds.
