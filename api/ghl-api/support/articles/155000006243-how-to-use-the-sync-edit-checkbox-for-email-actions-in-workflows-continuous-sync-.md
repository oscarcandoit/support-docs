# **What’s New**

- # **What is Sync Edit Checkbox on Template Selection:**


  - When you create an email action and choose an existing template, a “Sync Edits to Template” checkbox now appears.

  - The "Sync Edits to Template" checkbox lets you control if changes in your workflow email and the linked template always update each other automatically. Turn it ON to keep them synced, or OFF to make them independent and editable separately.

- **Sync Possibilities: What Happens When Sync is ON or OFF**

- **When Sync is ON:**

  - Any changes you make in your workflow email will automatically update the original template, and changes to the template will update your workflow email as well.

  - This is bi-directional syncing—both the workflow action and the template always match.
- **When Sync is OFF:**

  - Changes you make in your workflow email do **not** affect the original template, and future changes to the template won’t impact your workflow.

  - The workflow email and template now have independent content and updates.
- # **Benefits**


  - **When Sync is ON:**
    - Changes in the workflow’s email or the original template will always update the other.
    - Keeps content perfectly aligned across templates and workflows.
    - Saves time by managing updates in one place.
  - **When Sync is OFF** **:**
    - Workflow email actions and their original templates are fully independent.
    - Customize emails for specific workflows without affecting other templates or actions.
    - Ideal when you want to ‘break away’ from a template for a particular use case.

# **How to Use**

- # When adding or editing an email action in a workflow, select a template.

- A “Sync Edits to Template” checkbox appears.
  - **If you check it (turn ON):**
    - A modal will confirm: changes in either the workflow or template update the other.

- **If you leave it unchecked or turn OFF:**
  - A modal will explain your workflow email and template will not affect each other.
  - Click “Turn Off Sync” to confirm, now edits are independent.
