# Step 7: Add Product Weights

To ensure accurate shipping rates in your eCommerce store, it’s essential to add product weights on the product details page. Navigate to **Payments > Products > Variants > Shipping & Delivery > Weight**. If your product has multiple variants, you must specify the weight for each variant individually on its details page. This step is crucial for obtaining live shipping rates from Shippo during checkout; otherwise, a flat shipping rate will apply.

# Important Notes:

1. **Shippo Setup:** Ensure live rates at checkout by configuring Shipping options, Parcel templates, and Sender & Receiver addresses in Shippo. Live rates can only be enabled if the Shipping Options and Parcel templates have been setup.
2. **Live Token Generation:** Only a live token can connect your Shippo account to your eCommerce platform for fulfillments and live shipping rates.
3. **Product Weight addition:** Product weights need to be added in product details page in your Ecommerce store platform at _Payments > Products > Variants > Shipping & Delivery > Weight_. In case the product has multiple variants, product weights needs to be defined for variants in the variant details page to get live rates from Shippo at the time of checkout, otherwise it will throw a flat shipping rate.
