## **Overview**

When transferring your domain, it's critical to ensure that your DNS records are preserved. One of the most accurate ways to do this is by **uploading a DNS Zone File** exported from your current registrar.

This file contains all your domain’s DNS entries including A, CNAME, TXT, MX, and other record types which are essential for keeping your website, email, and other services running smoothly after the transfer.
