## **Why Are Calls Marked as Spam?**

Carriers and mobile devices use algorithms to detect and flag suspicious calls. If your number is labeled as spam, customers may ignore or block your calls, impacting your business communication.

### **Common Reasons for Spam Labelling:**

- **High Call Volumes:** Making too many calls in a short time can trigger spam filters.

- **Unfamiliar Numbers:** Calls from numbers not recognized by the recipient or without proper caller ID.

- **Frequent Customer Complaints:** If your number has been reported as spam multiple times.

- **Low Engagement Rates:** If a high percentage of your calls go unanswered or are rejected.

- **SHAKEN/STIR Authentication Failures:** If your caller ID isn’t verified, it may be flagged.


## **Key Impacts of Calls Being Marked as Spam**

When your business number is flagged, it can lead to:

- **Decreased Answer Rates:** Customers may ignore flagged calls, reducing conversions.

- **Damaged Business Reputation:** Being labeled as spam can create a negative impression.

- **Communication Barriers:** Important calls may be blocked or filtered by spam detection systems.


## **How to Prevent Your Calls from Being Marked as Spam**

Follow these best practices to improve your call credibility and avoid being flagged.

**1.******Leverage Voice Integrity to Build Trust****

Voice Integrity is a game-changing feature that helps protect your business calls from being flagged as “Spam Likely.” By registering your U.S.-based phone numbers with top caller ID analytics providers—First Orion, Hiya, and TNS—you can improve pickup rates and reinforce your brand’s trustworthiness.

# **Why Turn On Voice Integrity?**

If your business numbers are flagged or blocked, Voice Integrity helps you:

- **Fix bad reputations** and clear “Spam Likely” labels from legitimate calls.

- **Increase pickup rates**—recipients are more likely to answer when your caller ID shows a verified, trusted name.

- **Ensure your calls are seen as authentic**, not suspicious.

- Boost **call answer rates** with a verified and trusted caller ID

- Help prevent your numbers from being **blocked** or **ignored**

- Maintain a **positive caller reputation** over time

- Establish **trust and credibility** with recipients

- Support consistent **branding** through accurate caller ID display


## **What You Need to Get Started**

Before activating Voice Integrity, ensure you meet these requirements:

- **SHAKEN/STIR Certification** (Required):

Confirms your calls are legitimate and not spoofed.

- **CNAM Registration** (Recommended):

Displays your business name as the caller ID, increasing credibility.

- **U.S. Phone Numbers Only**:

Currently, Voice Integrity applies only to U.S.-based numbers. International traffic is not supported.


**How to Enable Voice Integrity**

You can easily set up Voice Integrity in just a few steps:

1. **Navigate to:** **`Settings > Phone Numbers > Trust Center > Voice Integrity`** **``**

2. **Fill Out the Form**

Provide the requested business and phone number details.

3. **Submit Your Application**

Applications are typically processed within **2 business days**.

4. **Check Application Status**

Track progress under the **“Submitted Applications”** section in the Trust Center.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054640191/original/jxzMtbUiY7JQl7NQjWfIhva6BF8ym3sUqA.png?1758870843)


## **What Happens After You Register?**

Once you submit your information, each of the analytics providers—Hiya, TNS, and First Orion—will review your registration separately.

- Expect to receive confirmation emails within 2 business days

- Spam label removal can take longer to reflect across all platforms.


### **2\. Enable SHAKEN/STIR Authentication (U.S. Only)**

### ****Note**- **An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is required to complete SHAKEN/STIR registration.** If you don’t have an EIN, we recommend registering your number with the [Free Call Registry](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005891-remediate-spam-likely-on-your-caller-id-using-free-caller-registry) instead.**

SHAKEN/STIR is a set of protocols designed to authenticate caller ID information and verify that it is coming from a legitimate source. The protocol works by using digital certificates to validate the caller's identity. When a call is made, the caller's identity is verified through these certificates, which are then stored in an online database. This ensures that when someone receives a call, they can trust that it is coming from who they think it is.

- These protocols verify your caller ID information, preventing fraud.

- Contact your phone service provider to enable SHAKEN/STIR on your number.


```
Note: SHAKEN/STIR won't remove nuisance labels but may boost answer rates due to the "Trusted Call" label.
```

### **3\. Update CNAM (Caller Name Presentation) Information**

Updating or adding CNAM (Caller Name Presentation) might increase call answers by offering accurate caller information, though it won't affect nuisance labels. CNAM is a feature in the United States public telephone network that identifies an incoming caller by a personal or business name associated with the calling party.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054640240/original/NWTImJtRzBsmiGM334byPVgTo6r8Yr0CNA.png?1758870886)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155054640240/original/NWTImJtRzBsmiGM334byPVgTo6r8Yr0CNA.png?1758870886)

```
Note: CNAM doesn't remove nuisance labels, but accurate caller information can enhance answer rates.
```

- Ensure your number correctly displays your business name on the caller ID.

- Work with your carrier to register or update your CNAM records.


> **Any entity with a business registration number—including sole proprietors with an EIN—may sign up for CNAM. An EIN is mandatory, whether you’re a one-person operation or a larger, registered brand.**

### **4\. Contact the Terminating Carrier (For International Numbers)**

Currently, there is no centralized system to remove spam labels from international numbers. If your calls are flagged as spam outside the US, contact the terminating carrier directly to address the issue.

### **5\. Consider Replacing the Phone Number**

If the phone number flagged as ‘Spam Likely’ is relatively new, non-critical, or has an FTC complaint associated with it, replacing the number may be the fastest and easiest solution.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Will registering my number immediately remove spam labels?**

Not necessarily. Registration helps, but it may take time for carriers to update records.

**Q. Should I register newly acquired numbers?**

Yes, registering new numbers can prevent potential spam mislabeling.

**Q. How long does Voice integrity registration take?**

Approval can take up to 2 **business days**.

**Q. Is there a cost for voice integrity submission?**

No, registering with the voice integrity is **completely free**.

**Q. How will phone numbers be linked to the SHAKEN/STIR Profile?**

All numbers will be Linked Automatically. All current available numbers and future bought numbers will automatically be linked with the registered SHAKEN/STIR.
