## **What types of questions are allowed?**

Google only approves **predefined, grammatically correct, clear, and policy-compliant questions** that:

- Belong to a supported vertical (e.g., Insurance, Auto, Education)

- Are easy to understand

- Do not request sensitive personal information

- Avoid promotional or sales-heavy language

- Use proper spelling and punctuation


If a user enters a custom question that doesn’t meet these criteria, the lead form may be rejected.

* * *

## **What Types of Questions Will Be Rejected?**

To ensure your lead form is approved, avoid the following types of questions:

### 1\. **Grammatically Incorrect or Poorly Structured Questions**

Questions that contain broken grammar, typos or unclear sentence structure are likely to be rejected.

**Examples:**

- “When want you to buy?”

- “Whats your insurence?”

- “Are you intrested in?”


**Better:**

- “When do you plan to make a purchase?”

- “What type of insurance are you looking for?”


* * *

### 2\. **Vague or Unclear Questions**

Too generic or incomplete questions can confuse users and trigger Google’s content filters.

**Examples:**

- “Tell us more”

- “Why?”

- “Interested?”


**Better:**

- “What are you looking for help with?”

- “Why are you considering switching providers?”


* * *

### 3\. **Leading or Suggestive Questions**

Questions that try to influence the user’s answer or include biased wording are restricted.

**Examples:**

- “Wouldn’t you agree we offer the best service?”

- “Don’t you think this is a great deal?”

- “Isn’t this the offer you’ve been waiting for?”


**Better:**

- “What factors matter most to you when choosing a provider?”

- “How important is pricing when selecting a service?”


* * *

### 4\. **Sensitive Personal Information**

Google prohibits collecting sensitive information that could violate privacy or data protection rules.

**Examples:**

- “What’s your Social Security number?”

- “Do you have any medical conditions?”

- “What’s your annual income?”


**Tip:**

Use native form fields (e.g., Name, Email, Phone) instead. Avoid asking for sensitive or legally protected information.

* * *

### 5\. **Promotional or Sales-Oriented Language**

Marketing-heavy or exaggerated language inside lead forms is discouraged.

**Examples:**

- “Do you want a FREE iPhone today?”

- “Grab this insane offer, just answer now!”

- “Win big! Fill this form to claim your reward!”


**Better:**

- “Would you like to receive more information about our current offers?”

- “Can we contact you about available discounts?”


* * *

### 6\. **Questions with Emojis, Special Characters, or ALL CAPS**

Overuse of formatting, emojis, or non-standard characters can result in form rejection.

**Examples:**

- “?GRAB YOUR DEAL NOW?”

- “WHAT’S YOUR NAME???”

- “What’s your ? number?”


**Better:**

- “What’s your phone number?”

- “What is your full name?”


* * *

## **Why Does Google Enforce These Rules?**

Google’s policies aim to protect users from misleading, intrusive, or unclear advertising. All custom questions must comply with:

- Google Ads Policies

- Local laws and advertising standards

- Google’s formatting and grammar requirements


Violating these may not only cause form rejection but could also impact your ad performance or account status.

* * *

## **Best Practices**

- Review every custom question for clarity and grammar.

- Don’t ask for personal data beyond name, email, or phone.

- Avoid emotional language, emojis, or sales phrases.

- Check your form in a preview before final submission.

- If your lead form gets rejected and you're unsure why, try the following:

  - Edit or remove the custom questions.
