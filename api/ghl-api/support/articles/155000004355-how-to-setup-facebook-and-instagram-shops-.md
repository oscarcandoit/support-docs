Step 2.2. **First-Time Connection:** For those connecting for the first time, store owners must link their Facebook account and grant the necessary permissions.

### **Reconnection for existing Facebook/ Instagram integration users**

1. This integration will be only available in the multiple Facebook feature, hence it should be enabled under **Labs** Section
2. In order to enable Shops, the users need to disconnect and reconnect the integration
3. Before re-connecting the integration, the LeadConnector integration should be removed in Facebook side as well. It can be found under **Facebook Profile > settings & privacy > Settings >** **Search for "business integrations"**.
4. Upon connecting again, the **Shops** should get enabled
5. If the necessary scope is not present, then an error state will be shown that the Catalog Management is disabled

## Step 3: Connect Facebook Shop Pages to Online Store

Once the desired shop pages are selected, store owners can link them to their Online stores through the " **Messenger Settings**" in the Facebook and Instagram Integration card. The Shops tab will display the selected pages, which need to be connected to the respective stores for product publishing and syncing.
