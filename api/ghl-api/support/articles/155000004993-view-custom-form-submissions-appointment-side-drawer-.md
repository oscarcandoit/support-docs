## Overview

The **View Form Submissions** feature allows users to see responses from custom booking forms directly within the **Appointment Modal**. This eliminates the need to navigate to the Forms module or Contacts to review details, making your scheduling workflow faster and more seamless.

* * *

## What’s New?

- **Forms Tab in Appointment Modal**

A new **Forms** tab appears within the Appointment Modal if the appointment has a **custom form** submission attached.

- **Structured Submission View**

Submitted form responses are displayed in a clean, structured format that mirrors the layout of the Forms module.

- **Access from Anywhere**

Whether you're in the **Calendars**, **Contacts**, or **Conversations** tab, clicking on an appointment will show the **Forms** tab if applicable.
