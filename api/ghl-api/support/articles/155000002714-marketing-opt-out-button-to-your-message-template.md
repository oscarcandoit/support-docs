## Enhance Customer Experience with a Marketing Opt-Out Button

Your business can now incorporate a marketing opt-out button in new marketing templates. This button enables customers to opt out of marketing messages while still receiving essential service communications. While this feature is optional, including it can bring several benefits.

### Benefits of Adding a Marketing Opt-Out Button

1. Reduce Block Rate

   - Lower Risk of Campaign Stoppages: High block rates can lead to campaign suspensions or a decline in your phone number's quality rating. Allowing customers to opt out instead of blocking your business ensures smoother campaign operations.
2. Facilitate Faster Scaling

   - Minimize Quality Issues: As your marketing outreach scales on WhatsApp, quality issues often arise from customers blocking certain templates. By offering an opt-out option, you can reduce block rates, thereby enabling faster increase in messaging limits.
3. Respect Customer Preferences

   - Tailored Communication: Providing an opt-out option allows customers to choose how they want to receive communications, preserving your ability to send crucial transactional and customer care messages.
4. Gain Valuable Insights

   - Customer Feedback: Unlike blocked numbers, opt-outs provide visibility into customer preferences, enabling you to refine and improve your marketing campaigns.

## Creating a High-Quality Opt-Out Experience

To ensure a positive user experience, consider the following best practices for designing your opt-out flow:

1. Honor All Opt-Out Requests

   - Respect Customer Choices: Ensure that once a customer opts out, you cease sending marketing messages from all of your WhatsApp numbers to avoid negative experiences and potential block rate increases.
2. Send Confirmation Replies

   - Acknowledge Opt-Outs: Confirm opt-out requests and offer an option to opt back in for those who may reconsider. Additionally, request feedback on why they opted out or their content preferences to enhance your messaging strategy.
3. Strategic Placement of Opt-Out Button

   - Optimize Frequency:Avoid adding the opt-out button to every message to prevent encouraging unnecessary opt-outs. Instead, include it in strategic messages such as:

     - The first message a customer receives from your business.

     - Messages sent after a significant period without marketing communication.

     - Messages targeted at unengaged customers.

By thoughtfully integrating a marketing opt-out button, you can improve customer satisfaction, maintain high campaign quality, and gain valuable insights to better tailor your marketing efforts.
