**Starting August 31, 2023, all A2P messages sent from unregistered ten-digit long code numbers (Local and National numbers) to US numbers will be blocked.**

Carriers are becoming increasingly sensitive to spam and AUP enforcement when it comes to SMS and Calls. To keep spamming in check and to protect the end customer (leads/contacts) they have created various regulations & compliance frameworks.

This article will help explain which compliance you or your client may need and how to get them.

If you are getting this **error "Maximum 3 tries exhausted,** please fill this out once you collected the CP 575 Form

[Upload Business registration form here](https://link.gohighlevel.com/widget/form/mfl7sSEccNAaQZOCalsA)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045075230/original/dBPQTXtDGStBoDAyP8an1GrYW44pe6y4fA.png?1744652325)

Please send us the **CP 575 form** (screenshots is fine) for the sub-account. Once that's done, we will send that form for Brand approval.

We will need to make sure the legal business name and number submitted on the business profile matches exactly with the form. Once that's matched but it is still rejected, This is the only form TCR refers to.

NOTE: If you're registering a US entity, please enter the exact legal business name as registered with the EIN, which can be found on the CP 575 EIN Confirmation Letter. An exact match between the legal business name and the EIN as displayed on CP 575 is required for the Brand to be successfully registered. Please do not use the legal business name found on the W2 or W9 forms as they may be different from what you have on the CP 575 notice. If you've **misplaced your CP 575 notice, you may request a 147c letter from the IRS** and use the information there for registration.

Please note that your full legal business name may span multiple lines on your CP 575 / 147c letter. If that is the case, you must input all the lines above the address line (which constitutes your full legal business name) instead of just using the first line.

Example:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043009597/original/0UILpXV9sbaATOxz83BMx4vg4e8vEBS4CQ.jpeg?1741675730)

**NOTE-**

If the Business registration document EIN was issued recently within the last 45 days, it takes about 45 days from the issue date for the IRS to update the Global Verification Database.

In this situation, you have two options:

1) You can **wait 45 days** for the database to be updated and then resubmit

OR

2) You can **reach out to our support to apply for an identity status appeal** which involves our carrier submitting a request to TCR (The Campaign Registry) to reach out to their providers to get your information updated on their side. An identity status appeal costs $10 and is charged by TCR.

We will automatically create the messaging service and link it to all the phone numbers available in the sub-account once the campaign is approved.

# **FAQ**

### **What is the pre-requisite for A2P Standard registration?**

The prerequisite to A2P registration is to create a business profile providing the EIN and additional business registration information.

### **Are there any charges associated with the Low Standard brand registration?**

Yes, there is a one-time **$4.41 USD** and a monthly Campaign Fee **($1.5 USD to $11.5 USD)**. For most cases, we have seen this to be $2/month.

### **I am still unsure of what all this means. What do I do?**

For now, if you are unsure about how A2P 10DLC compliance works, it will be the best strategy to stop using local & mobile numbers and start using Toll-Free numbers altogether as explained here.

### **What information would be required from the sub-account to move with the registration?**

The sub-account will need a business registration EIN and some additional info like address, website and etc.

### **Is messaging to Canada or any other countries also affected by these changes?**

No. Canadian mobile carriers may introduce registered A2P 10DLC solutions in the future, but at this time carriers have not announced any plans to do so.

For information about message sending in countries other than the US, we recommend checking out our country-specific SMS Guidelines pages to learn about any unique rules or restrictions in that country.

### **I have been sending SMS forever, what has changed?**

A2P 10DLC (Application-to-Person 10-Digit Long Code) is a messaging framework introduced by the wireless industry in the United States to regulate and improve the delivery of Application-to-Person text messages. It aims to address issues related to spam and unwanted messages on long codes while ensuring legitimate businesses can continue using text messaging for communication with their customers.

### **Does this apply to only marketing campaigns or does it apply to all SMS?**

A2P 10DLC is applicable for all Application-to-Person texting like marketing SMS, reactivation campaigns, appointment reminders, prospecting, billing alerts, 2FA login codes, etc.

### **How long do I have to complete the registration for myself and my clients?**

The deadline to complete your (and your client's) A2P 10DLC registration and get compliant is August 31, 2023.

### **How can I become compliant?**

Please refer to the following help articles:

-  LC Phone System Trust Center
- A2P 10DLC Brand Approval Best Practices
- A2P 10DLC Campaign Approval Best Practices

### **What happens if I or my clients can't perform the registration in time?**

Unfortunately, your SMS traffic will cease to deliver to AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, ClearSky, etc. if you do not perform the registration. Please note this is not specific to LeadConnector Phone or enforced by us. This is done by the carriers and The Campaign Registry.

### **Is there a cost associated with the A2P 10DLC registration?**

Yes, since January 2023 there is a fee charged by carriers and The Campaign Registry for vetting your brand & campaign applications. You can find the details of the fees associated with A2P 10DLC **here**.

### **I don't want to deal with all of this. Is there any alternative for me and my clients?**

Yes, while we advise you to become compliant if you wish to continue sending SMS from local & mobile numbers in the USA, you could avoid A2P 10DLC altogether by switching to using Toll-free numbers.

Toll-free numbers also require registration but it is free and less complicated than A2P 10DLC.

Please refer to **Toll-Free Number Registration for LC - Phone (US/Canada)** to learn how you can switch to toll-free numbers and perform toll-free number registration. This is free and by using this you can avoid dealing with A2P 10DLC registrations and associated costs altogether.
