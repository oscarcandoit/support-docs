## Option 2: Manual Migration (Using the All-in-One WP Migration Plugin)

**On the Source WordPress Site:**

- Install and activate the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin.

- Export your website to generate a **.wpress** file.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045795959/original/mfTW5RSVxEtGvMVwDdxcGNME40pvkimthw.png?1745867237)


**On the Destination WordPress Site:**

- Log in to your hosting dashboard.

- Navigate to **WordPress → Import Existing Website**.

- Click **Choose File** and upload the .wpress file (Max size: **2GB**).

- Wait for the upload and deployment to complete.


⚠️ **Note:** This method **overwrites** all existing content on the destination site. Incremental updates are not supported.
