### **Unknown Error (where both the Plugin and File could be corrupted):**

It will detect plugin issue first & display the plugin error on the UI)

The plugin named “yith-topbar-countdown” is corrupted. The Error can be in this WordPress installation or it can be in your source WordPress installation (from where you have created this file), please delete this plugin and try again. Once you have done that if the file is corrupted too then the error will change and show the file corruption error discussed above, you can then delete the file and try again in that case.
