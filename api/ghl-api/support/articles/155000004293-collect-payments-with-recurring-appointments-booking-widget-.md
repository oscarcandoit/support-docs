Recurring appointments are appointments that repeat according to a set schedule, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

### **Payment Options for Recurring Appointment**

You can accept payments for recurring appointments on the booking widget with two options:

1. **Collect Payment for First Appointment Only**
   - The payment is collected for the initial appointment only. For example, if you have 3 recurring appointments and the price is $50 per appointment, you will collect $50 at the time of booking. Subsequent payments for the remaining appointments will need to be collected manually.
2. **Collect Payment for All Appointments**
   - The total amount is collected at the time of booking, covering all appointments in the series. For example, for 3 recurring appointments at $50 each, a total of $150 is collected upfront. However, the final amount charged may vary depending on how many appointments are actually booked. This could change based on your availability and the settings you’ve configured for handling unavailability.

**Note:** **Recurring Calendars do not support partial payments.**
