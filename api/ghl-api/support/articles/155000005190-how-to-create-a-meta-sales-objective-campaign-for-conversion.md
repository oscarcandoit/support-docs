## **Introduction**

With the launch of the Sales objective in Meta Ads, we aim to drive sales conversions on both Website and Messaging apps. This new feature will allow you to maximise the effectiveness of your ad campaigns by selecting either a Website or Messaging app as your conversion location. The following sections will guide you through setting up the Sales objective, answer frequently asked questions, and provide troubleshooting tips.

With the **Sales Objective**, businesses can run highly optimised ads using the following conversion locations:

**Website Conversions** – Use **Meta Pixel** to track and optimise actions such as purchases and sign-ups on your website.

**Messaging Apps** – Drive direct customer interactions via **Facebook Messenger, Instagram Direct and WhatsApp messages** to increase engagement and conversions.

```
Note: Currently, only Website and Messaging Apps are supported as conversion locations. Other locations like App and In-Store are not available at this time.

## **FAQs**

1. **What is the Sales Objective?**

The Sales objective is designed to help you drive conversions with a focus on direct sales. You can either drive traffic to your website to make a purchase or direct users to messaging apps where they can make a transaction or engage with your business.

2. **What conversion locations are supported for the Sales objective?**

Currently, only **Website** and **Messaging Apps** (such as Messenger and WhatsApp) are supported for the Sales objective.

3. **How do I track conversions on my website?**

To track conversions on your website, you must have the **Meta Pixel** installed on your website. This pixel will track actions such as purchases, add-to-cart events, and other relevant conversion activities.

4. **Can I use both Website and Messaging Apps for the same campaign?**

No, you must choose one conversion location for each campaign. If you need both types of conversions, create separate campaigns - one for the website and another for the messaging app.

5. **Do I need to install any code to track conversions via Messaging Apps?**

No additional code is needed for tracking conversions via messaging apps. However, ensure your messaging app is set up to track user interactions.

6. **Can I target users who have interacted with my business before?**

Yes, using **Custom Audiences**, you can target users who have interacted with your business, such as website visitors or users who have engaged with your messaging app.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

**1\. My website conversions aren’t being tracked.**

- **Check Meta Pixel installation**: Ensure the Meta Pixel is installed and firing correctly on your website. You can use the **Pixel Helper** Chrome extension to verify if the Pixel is working as expected.
- **Check Pixel settings**: Make sure the Pixel is configured to track the specific conversion actions (e.g., purchase, add to cart).
- **Verify URL settings**: Ensure that the Pixel is correctly linked to the specific pages where conversions are happening.


**2\. My Messaging App isn’t tracking conversions properly.**

- **Ensure messaging is enabled**: Check that messaging apps (like Messenger, Instagram Direct or WhatsApp) are properly set up within Meta Ads and linked to your business.
- **Test interaction tracking**: Try interacting with your messaging app via an ad and verify that the conversion event is being tracked in your Meta Ads Manager.


**3\. My campaign is not delivering as expected.**

- **Adjust your budget**: If your budget is too low, it may impact the delivery of your campaign. Consider increasing it to allow the system more flexibility to optimize.
- **Check audience targeting**: Ensure that your audience settings are broad enough to generate conversions. Narrow targeting can limit delivery.
- **Review ad creatives**: Ads that are too similar or non-engaging may perform poorly. Test different creatives to see which resonates best with your audience.


**4\. How do I fix low conversion rates?**

- **Optimise your landing page**: Ensure your website or landing page is optimized for conversions with a clear call to action and fast load times.
- **Refine your audience targeting**: Analyze your audience performance and adjust it to ensure you’re targeting those most likely to convert.
- **Improve ad creatives**: Refresh your ads regularly and test new formats to keep your campaigns fresh and engaging.

## **Best Practices for Maximising Sales with Meta Ads**

- **Use High-Quality Creatives:** Eye-catching visuals improve engagement.
- **Leverage retargeting**: Retarget website visitors or people who’ve interacted with your messaging app to bring them back to complete the conversion.
- **Optimise for mobile**: Ensure your website and messaging app are optimised for mobile users, as a significant portion of Meta Ads traffic comes from mobile devices.
- **Test and learn**: Continuously test your ad creatives, targeting options, and budgets to optimise your campaign performance.
