Starting July 5, 2023, all SMS and MMS messages to U.S. phone numbers using 10DLC phone numbers must be part of a registered A2P campaign. Failure to comply may result in message blocking. Ensure your phone numbers and messaging campaigns are properly registered to avoid disruption in your messaging services.

## **What do you need to know?**

- Starting July 5, 2023, all SMS and MMS messages to U.S. phone numbers using 10DLC phone numbers **must go through a registered A2P campaign**.
- Setting up new phone numbers or messaging campaigns will require additional time for data collection, submission, processing, and third-party approval.
- If you send messages using unregistered phone numbers, Phone providers will gradually increase message blocking, starting July 5, 2023, leading to a full block after August 31, 2023.
- Blocked messages will receive error code 30034 for unregistered 10DLC messages.
- Unregistered Messaging rates will still apply, even for blocked messages.
- To check your phone numbers' A2P 10DLC registration status, refer to our[LC Phone System Trust Center](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/support/solutions/articles/48001226976-leadconnector-phone-system-trust-center) guide.

## **Why is this happening?**

- Starting July 5, 2023, message blocking will gradually increase to allow customers to transition to registered A2P campaigns before the Phone providers fully block unregistered messages on August 31, 2023.
- **Major U.S. telecommunications carriers** require U.S. A2P 10DLC registration to establish a fully verified messaging ecosystem.

## **What do you need to do?**

- No further action is needed if you already use registered A2P campaigns for all your U.S. messaging.
- If you rely on provisioning new 10DLC phone numbers to send messages to U.S. recipients, associate those numbers with an approved A2P campaign or initiate a new A2P campaign registration.
- Note that A2P campaign registration takes time and requires third-party cooperation for carrier approval. Refer to our [A2P 10DLC Campaign Vetting Changes](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000859-a2p-10dlc-campaign-vetting-changes-january-2023) guide for processing time updates. Check out [A2P 10DLC Campaign Approval Best Practices](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000174-a2p-10dlc-campaign-approval-best-practices).
