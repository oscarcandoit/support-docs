#### **How to create a Room?**

**1\. Access Calendar Settings and Enable Rooms:**

- Go to your account and navigate to Calendars > Calendar Settings.
- Under Preferences > In App Preferences, toggle on Rooms and Equipments.

**2\. Create a Room:**

- Once you've enabled the feature, a new 'Rooms' tab will appear.
- Under the 'Rooms' tab > Click on Create Room.

**3\. Provide Room Details:**

- To create a room, enter the following information:
  - **Room Name:** Assign a unique name to the room.
  - **Description:** Briefly describe the room's purpose.
  - **Room Capacity:** Specify the maximum number of appointments that can be scheduled in the room simultaneously. This determines how many bookings can overlap in the same room.

**4\. Associate Calendars:**

- Select the calendars that are associated with this room. Whenever an appointment is booked on any of the associated calendars, the room will also be booked automatically.
  - **For example**, if you have two service calendars, such as 'Body Massage' and 'Head Massage,' both associated with the same room called 'The Massage Room,' specifying a room capacity of 2 means that two appointments can take place simultaneously.
  - If one appointment is already booked on one calendar, users can still book another appointment for the same time slot in either calendar. However, if two appointments are already booked, there will be no available slots. This considers both user availability and room availability to ensure efficient scheduling.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create and configure rooms in your scheduling system. This ensures a seamless booking process and effective resource allocation.

#### **Additional Information**

**1\. Rooms and Equipment Details:**

- Find your rooms and equipment details within the **appointment modal - details view.**
- This ensures you can now easily identify which room has been **assigned** to a particular appointment and which equipment is being used or has been booked in conjunction with the appointment.
- This feature simplifies the management of appointments, making it more informative and streamlined.

**2\. Room Selection for Service Calendars**

- In the **in-app appointment modal**, for service calendar appointments, we have introduced a **room dropdown** option during the appointment creation or booking process.
- This empowers you to choose the specific room you want to book alongside your appointment. It offers greater flexibility and control over the booking process.
- With this process, you can effortlessly allocate the right room for your appointments, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
