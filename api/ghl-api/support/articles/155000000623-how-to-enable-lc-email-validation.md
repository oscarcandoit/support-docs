## **FAQ**

### **What does Email Validation check for?**

- The email address syntax is correct.

- The domain is set up to receive email.

- The email address exists.

- The email address isn’t a high-risk address.

- The email address isn’t role-based, such as info@domain.com or admin@domain.com.


### **Why is Email Validation important?**

Email Validation is important because of the:

- Boosts your delivery rate by removing invalid email addresses.
- Maintains your mailing list hygiene by keeping your email list up-to-date.
- Improves your email marketing metrics like click-through rate (CTR), open rate, and click-to-open ratio (CTOR).
- Protects your sender's reputation.

### **How does Email Validation impact my email deliverability?**

Email deliverability is highly impacted by bounced emails. Decrease email bounces by performing email Validation ahead of time.

Your IP address and domain reputation take a hit when your email service provider (ESP) can’t place your email into a subscriber’s inbox. This impacts future deliverability because email clients rely on IP and sender reputations to determine whether or not to deliver your messages. If you have a bad sender or IP reputation, email clients may decide to place emails sent from your domain name in your subscriber’s spam folder. Or, they may not deliver them at all.

### **When should I validate my email list?**

If you’ve bought a mailing list (which we highly recommend that you don’t) or inherited a mailing list, you’re unfamiliar with. It’s a great idea to use an email verifier.

In addition, if your list has grown or it’s been some time since you last verified your email addresses, we recommend giving your mailing list a health check today.
