## Why You Need To (& Should) Have An Unsubscribe Link In Your Emails

Digital laws might differ from country to country, but almost every country states that you must have an unsubscribe link in your email. The most popularly referenced law is -- US’s CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing) legislation enforced by the Federal Trade Commission.

In May 2018, GDPR became a compulsory rule for any brand with subscribers in the EU.

According to article 17 of GDPR, ‘Right to erasure’, data subjects (subscribers) have the right to ask for their data to be deleted. In that case, data controllers have to comply with it. They have to delete any data when it’s no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected or the data holder/subjects withdraw consent for it to be used.

If a contact unsubscribes from an email list, they are exercising their 'Right to erasure', and the data controller (the email list owner) has to unsubscribe them and delete their data.

Non-compliance with GDPR can lead to a fine amounting to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher.

## Benefits of including an email unsubscribe link

1 . **Shun customer frustration:** Many subscribers consent to newsletters without knowing what they will deliver. After receiving the email copy, they realized it was irrelevant to them. Then if they want to unsubscribe from the newsletter and fail to find the link. You know how frustrating it is when you can’t see the unsubscribe link inside the email. Marketers need to understand the interests and preferences of different subscribers and allow them to opt-out of the email list. It improves the email marketing strategy’s outcome as you are allowing inactive subscribers to leave the contact list.

2\. **Collect feedback:** You can collect valuable feedback from those subscribers who are no longer part of your contact list. You can use those feedback to understand the loopholes and optimize the email communications to meet your subscribers’ needs.

3\. **Enter into the inbox:** Unsubscribe links increase the possibility of entering the subscribers’ inbox rather than going into the spam folders. If people search for an unsubscribe link and don’t find it, they will put that email in the spam folder. Your account can be suspended if your spam rate exceeds the open rate.

4\. **Adapt anti-spam legislation:** While including the unsubscribe link, every country has its law and order. It is compulsory in anti-spam legislation to give a predefined law for email marketers.
