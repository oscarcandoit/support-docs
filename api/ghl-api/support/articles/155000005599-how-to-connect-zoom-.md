### **Overview**

By connecting your Zoom account, you can generate dynamic meeting links, reducing the time spent for any manual actions. If you have selected Zoom as your meeting location in any calendar, upon a new booking, the system will automatically generate a unique Zoom link, which will be sent along with the calendar invite.
