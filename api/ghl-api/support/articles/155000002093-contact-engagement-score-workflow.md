## **Contact Engagement Score Trigger**

The Contact Engagement Score Trigger enables the automation of workflow actions in response to updates in a contact's Engagement Score. This feature is designed to help users efficiently manage and respond to their contacts' engagement levels.

### **Key Features:**

- Automated Activation: Automatically trigger workflow actions based on changes in Engagement Scores.
- Customizable Filters: Apply filters to trigger workflows based on specific numerical conditions of the Engagement Score.

### **Available conditions include:**

1. Equal to a score
2. Not equal to a score
3. Greater than a score
4. Greater than or equal to a score
5. Less than a score
6. Less than or equal to a score
7. Is empty
8. Is not empty

These conditions can be used to precisely define when the workflow is triggered, based on the contact engagement score.

## **Modify Contact Engagement Score Action**

With the "Modify Contact Engagement Score" action, users have the capability to directly influence a contact's Engagement Score. This action allows for the addition or subtraction of points from the existing score, offering a flexible approach to engagement management.

### **How It Works:**

- Adjust Engagement Scores: Add or subtract points to fine-tune a contact's Engagement Score.
- Flexible Engagement Management: React to engagement changes dynamically by modifying scores as needed.

## **Use-cases:**

- **Segmentation for Targeted Campaigns:** Triggering workflows to segment contacts into different marketing campaigns based on their engagement score thresholds.

- **Automated Follow-up:** Initiating a follow-up sequence when a contact's engagement score drops below a certain point, indicating they may be losing interest.

- **Rewarding Engaged Contacts:** Automatically sending rewards or exclusive offers to contacts whose engagement scores reach a high threshold, encouraging further interaction.

- **Data Cleaning:** Identifying contacts with an "empty" engagement score as potentially inactive or unengaged, prompting a review or removal from active campaigns to focus resources on engaged contacts.
