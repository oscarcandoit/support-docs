## **Overview**

CNAM (Caller Name Presentation) is a feature in the U.S. public telephone network that associates your phone number with a **business or personal name**. When you make an outgoing call, this name may be displayed on the recipient’s device.

## **Why CNAM Matters**

- Builds trust with your contacts

- Increases the chance that calls are answered

- Does not remove nuisance labels

- Business name display is not guaranteed (depends on the recipient’s carrier policies)


## **Requirements**

- An **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** is mandatory for CNAM registration.

- Both **sole proprietors** and larger businesses with an EIN can register.


# **How to Register or Update CNAM**

You can register or update your CNAM records directly from the **Trust Center**—no need to go through your carrier.

### Steps:

1. Go to sub-account Settings > Phone Numbers > Trust Center.

2. Click on CNAM (voice)

3. start registering

## **Benefits at a Glance**

| Feature | What It Does | Benefit to You |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CNAM** | Displays your business name on outgoing calls | Improves recognition and trust, leading to higher answer rates |

```

Note: CNAM doesn't remove nuisance labels, but accurate caller information can enhance answer rates.
```

- Ensure your number correctly displays your business name on the caller ID.

- Work with your carrier to register or update your CNAM records.


> **Any entity with a business registration number—including sole proprietors with an EIN—may sign up for CNAM. An EIN is mandatory, whether you’re a one-person operation or a larger, registered brand.**

**Tip**: CNAM does not replace SHAKEN/STIR. For best results, use **both together**—SHAKEN/STIR authenticates your caller ID, while CNAM displays your business name.
