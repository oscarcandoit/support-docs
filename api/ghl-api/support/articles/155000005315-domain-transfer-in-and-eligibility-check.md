## Overview: What is Domain Transfer In?

The Domain Transfer In feature allows users to transfer their domain name from an external registrar (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) to our platform. Once transferred, users can manage their domain's DNS, billing, and security directly within the platform.

Bringing domains in offers convenience and helps users centralize all aspects of domain management in one place. It also contributes to improved customer retention and engagement.

## Eligibility Check

During the Eligibility Check, We verify whether your domain qualifies to be transferred into the platform. The system evaluates both registrar-level rules and technical readiness. If the domain is eligible for transfer you can continue with the transfer process. When a domain is eligible for transfer you can see the

- Domain Name

- Current Domain Registrar

- Current expiration and new expiration (extended by 1 year)

- Applicable fee for the extension of expiry date.

- Its current registrar is notsupported.

- It has been previously purchased internally.

- It’s TLD is not supported.

- It has been purchased or transferred in last 60 days

- It has an EPP status that does not allow for transfers (eg, pendingDelete, redemptionPeriod, serverHold etc)
