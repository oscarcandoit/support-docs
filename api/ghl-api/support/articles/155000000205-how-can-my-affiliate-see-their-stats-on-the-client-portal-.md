## **What is the Client Portal?**

Client Portal is a centralized platform enabling clients to interact with your business across multiple domains. Logging into the portal allows clients to view and manage their affiliate commissions, join community groups, and access their membership courses. This one-stop access point enhances customer service and promotes client retention by facilitating easy communication and self-service.

Please review these articles for more details on the Client Portal:

### **Usage Cases for Affiliate Manager data visibility on the Client Portal:**

**Tracking Campaign Success:** The dashboard on the Client Portal shows the count of leads, customers, and canceled customers who have signed up through an affiliate's links. This information can help your affiliates assess the success of their marketing efforts. They can identify which campaigns are working best and where to improve.

**Viewing Payment Information:** By accessing the Commission screen, affiliates can view their earned commissions, the amount owed to them, and the total revenue they have generated for your business. This transparency can encourage trust and motivate them to improve their performance further.

**Identifying Effective Channels:** By analyzing the leads and customers who have signed up through their links (accessible on the Leads/Customers screen), affiliates can identify which channels or platforms bring in the most sign-ups. They can then focus their efforts on these channels to maximize conversions.

**Planning Future Campaigns:** All the statistics in the Client Portal can inform future marketing campaigns. Affiliates can identify successful strategies from their stats and replicate these in future campaigns.

**Evaluating the Impact of Inactive Campaigns:** Affiliates who are part of inactive campaigns can still view their stats, even if they can't use their affiliate links. They could use these statistics to evaluate the potential impact of these campaigns if they were to become active again.

**Analyzing Customer Behavior Post-Sign-Up:** With information on canceled customers, affiliates can understand the reasons behind customer drop-offs and strategize ways to minimize them.

**Improving Communication with the Business:** Regularly checking their stats allows affiliates to have informed discussions with your team about their performance, issues, or suggestions for the affiliate program.

Please note: The information in the Client Portal can only be as accurate as the input data. Ensure all relevant data for your affiliates is correctly and promptly entered and updated.

## **How can Affiliates Access the Client Portal?**

### **Adding Affiliate to Campaign:**

As an account owner, navigate to the Affiliate Manager and add your affiliate to an active campaign. Once added, they will automatically receive an email invitation to sign up on the MyPortal app.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001509952/original/9mvsff47wE8G4_jTDfTWJGoVFAV1vb111Q.png?1687364224)

**Please Note:**

```
If your affiliate does not receive the invitation email, advise them to check their spam or junk folders. If the email is not there, double-check that you entered their email address correctly and that the campaign is active.
```

### **Affiliate Sign-Up:**

Your affiliate should click the link in the invitation email. This will redirect them to a sign-up page. Ask them to follow the prompts to create their account.

**Please Note:**

```
If your affiliate is having trouble signing up, advise them to ensure they enter the correct details and have a strong internet connection.
```

### **Affiliate Login:**

Once your affiliate has created their account, they can log in to the MyPortal app using their credentials or a one-time password provided during the sign-up process.

**Please Note:**

```
If your affiliate is having trouble logging in, advise them to ensure they are using the correct credentials. If they forgot their password, they can reset it using the "Forgot Password" function.
```

### **Accessing the Affiliate Dashboard:**

Once logged in, your affiliate will land on the Affiliate Dashboard, where they can view their stats and affiliate links.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001390797/original/2O7lI9f5am2cyjBs3QVGHkO5SF9JhSKc-w.png?1687260196)

**Please Note:**

```
If the affiliate dashboard is not immediately visible upon login, instruct your affiliate to click on the 9 dots in the top right corner and choose "Affiliates."
```

This process ensures your affiliate has access to the MyPortal app, enabling them to keep track of their stats, manage their affiliate links, and easily access necessary information.

**Please Note:**

```
If the commission isn't reflecting in cash flows as expected, it could be due to various factors, such as return policies or the payment cycle. The Affiliate Manager just calculates the ideal amount. Make sure your affiliates know that.
```

### **Quick Pointers:**

Affiliates should be aware that if they are added to an inactive campaign, they can view their stats, but their affiliate link will be disabled, preventing its use for that particular campaign.
