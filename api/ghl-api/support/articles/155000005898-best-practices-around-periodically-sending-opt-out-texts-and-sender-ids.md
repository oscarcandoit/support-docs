## **What's new?**

When we introduced **automated opt-out and sender info insertion**, the goal was simple: help agencies stay compliant with evolving regulations — without requiring manual effort.

Now, we’re giving you **more control and flexibility**. With this latest update, every sub-account gets a straightforward **on/off setting** for the periodic opt-out feature. This means you can tailor compliance to each client’s needs, rather than applying it across the platform.

We’ve also improved how opt-out content is detected, ensuring **better accuracy, fewer false positives, and smoother conversations**.

### Enable or Disable with a Click

- Agencies and sub-accounts will now see a **checkbox setting** to toggle the periodic opt-out & sender info feature on or off.

### Smart Defaults Based on Account Type

- **New sub-accounts**: Periodic opt-out is **enabled by default**.

- **Existing sub-accounts**: Periodic opt-out is **disabled by default** (giving you control to turn it on as needed).


### Improved Opt-Out Phrase Detection (Based on Your Feedback!)

- Previously, the system flagged individual keywords like _“stop”_ or _“cancel”_. This sometimes caused unnecessary opt-out insertions (e.g., _“please stop by the office”_ or _“cancel the reservation”_).

- Now, the system checks for the **entire opt-out phrase** before adding compliance language.

- This means:

  - Fewer false positives

  - Cleaner messages

  - A smoother recipient experience

### No Impact on First Message Compliance

- The **first message** in any SMS conversation will **always include** opt-out language and sender details, as required.

- This update only affects **how often** that information is repeated in longer conversations.


Note- If one of the first two options (opt-out message or sender information) is checked while ‘Enable Periodic Opt-Out’ is unchecked, only the selected item will be sent once. If both are checked and ‘Enable Periodic Opt-Out’ is unchecked, both will be sent once. If one of the first two is checked along with ‘Enable Periodic Opt-Out,’ that selected item will be sent periodically. If both of the first two are checked and ‘Enable Periodic Opt-Out’ is also checked, then both will be sent periodically.

## **1\. Why Opt-Out Reminders and Sender Identification Matter**

**Legal Requirements**

Laws like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in the U.S. and similar rules in Canada require that businesses give people a clear way to opt out of receiving text messages.

**Trust and Deliverability**

Including opt-out instructions and identifying your business helps reduce complaints and increases your chances of successful message delivery.

**Carrier Compliance**

Mobile carriers enforce these rules. If you don’t follow them, your messages may be blocked, or your account could be suspended.

* * *

## **2\. Best Practices for Opt-Out Messages**

**a. Always Provide Clear Opt-Out Instructions**

Each message or campaign should include a simple opt-out method like:

“Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”

This is required under U.S. carrier rules.

**b. Include Opt-Out Language Regularly**

- Add opt-out text in the first message you send.

- For ongoing campaigns, include opt-out reminders at least once a month(by enabling the periodic opt out)


**Note: If you adjust the frequency (e.g., from 30 days to another interval), the new schedule will take effect starting from the date the change is made.**

**c. Use Standard Keywords**

Use commonly recognized opt-out keywords such as:

STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, QUIT

These are automatically understood by carriers.

**d. Process Opt-Outs Immediately**

When someone replies with an opt-out keyword, stop sending them messages right away.

You should also send a confirmation message like:

“You have been unsubscribed. Reply START to resubscribe.”

**e. Respect Consent**

Only send messages to people who have agreed to receive them.

If you have long-standing contact lists, it's a good idea to check in every 18 months to confirm they still want to hear from you.

## **3\. Best Practices for Identifying Your Business (Sender ID)**

**a. Always Include Your Brand Name**

Mention your business name in every message. This is especially important if you're using a phone number or short code that customers might not recognize.

Example:

“Hi, this is Acme Health with your appointment reminder.”

**b. Be Transparent and Consistent**

Use a sender ID that customers will recognize. If you use shared or rotating numbers, it’s even more important to include your business name in every message.

* * *

## **4\. How Often to Send Opt-Out Reminders**

| **Situation** | **Best Practice** |
| --- | --- |
| First message | Include your business name and opt-out instructions |
| Monthly reminders | Add opt-out language at least once a month for ongoing texts |

**Note: If you adjust the frequency (e.g., from 30 days to another interval), the new schedule will take effect starting from the date the change is made.**

* * *

## **5\. What to Avoid**

- **Do not hide opt-out instructions**

Make sure they are easy to find and clearly worded.

- **Do not use unregistered sender IDs**

In regions where registration is required, only use approved sender IDs.

- **Do not continue messaging people who have opted out**

Once someone unsubscribes, do not message them again unless they opt back in.


* * *

## **6\. Example of a Compliant Message**

“Acme Co: Your monthly update is here. Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”

This message clearly identifies the sender and provides a simple opt-out option.

## **Final Thoughts**

Sending regular opt-out reminders and clearly identifying your business isn't just about following the rules—it's about treating your customers with respect. When you make it easy for people to understand who’s messaging them and how they can stop if they choose, you're building trust and improving the overall experience.

By following these best practices, you’ll stay compliant, reduce the risk of getting blocked, and strengthen your relationship with your audience.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**1.** **Do I have to include “Reply STOP to unsubscribe” in every message?**

No, not in _every_ message. However, it must be included in your first message and should be repeated regularly—at least once a month. This helps with compliance and keeps your audience informed.

**2\. What happens if someone replies STOP?**

Once someone replies with a standard opt-out keyword (like STOP, CANCEL, or UNSUBSCRIBE), you must immediately stop sending them messages. You should also send them a confirmation message letting them know they’ve been unsubscribed.

**3.** **What happens if I don’t follow these best practices?**

If your messages don’t meet carrier or legal requirements, they may be blocked, filtered as spam, or your messaging account could be suspended. It can also damage your brand’s reputation with customers.
