### **Step 1: Create a QR Code for your Business**

To get started, follow these simple steps to create a QR Code that links directly to your review page:

1. **Navigate to Reputation:** Access the reputation management platform and navigate to the "Reviews QR" section under Reputation -> Settings.
2. **Select the Page:** Choose the specific review page you want your QR Code to direct customers to.
3. **Generate the QR Code:** Click on the “Create QR Code” button. A unique QR Code will be generated that customers can scan to leave their reviews or feedback.

```
? Tip: You can create multiple QR Codes for different pages, such as Google Reviews, Facebook Reviews, or a custom feedback form.

### **Step 2: Customise the QR Code**

After generating your QR Code, you can customise it to align with your brand and messaging:

1. **Add a Logo or Image:** Personalise your QR Code by adding your company logo or any relevant image.
2. **Change the Text:** Modify the text that appears with your QR Code to include any vital message you want to convey.

### **Step 3: Display your QR Code**

Once your QR Code is ready, it’s time to make it accessible to your customers:

1. **Download the QR Code:** Save the QR Code in the PDF format.
2. **Print and Display:** Add the QR Code to printed materials such as flyers, receipts, or business cards.
3. **Share Digitally:** Include the QR Code in your email signatures, social media posts, or on your website.

```
Tip: Position the QR Code in high-visibility areas where customers are likely to see and scan it.
```

### **Step 4: Monitor and Track**

After deploying your QR Code, it's essential to monitor its performance:

1. **Track Scans:** Access the "Tracking" section within the platform to view real-time data on how many times your QR Code has been scanned.
2. **Analyse Results:** Review the data to understand customer engagement and determine the success of your QR Code campaign.
3. **Optimise:** Based on the scan data, make adjustments to your strategy, such as changing the location of the QR Code or refining the call-to-action.

```
Tip: Regularly monitoring scan activity can help you identify trends and opportunities to improve your reputation management efforts.
