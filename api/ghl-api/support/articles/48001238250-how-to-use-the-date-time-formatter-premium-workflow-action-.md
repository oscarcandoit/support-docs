**Please Note:**

```
The difference is calculated as End Date - Start Date. You will get a negative value if the Start Date exceeds the End Date.

The Compare Dates function is beneficial for users who need to perform date comparisons for various purposes, such as calculating due dates, determining the duration between events, or making decisions based on the time difference between two dates.
```

* * *

### **Points to remember:**

- Format the Inbound Webhook Trigger data to Set Event Start Date, to update Contact Custom Fields, and to compare in If/Else Condition.
- Let's say the date format is MM/DD/YYYY, but you need to send it to an app that formats dates as DD/MM/YYYY; you can use the Date/Time Formater to change the date format and send it via Custom Webhook.
- Store the custom formatted date time info in Google Sheets
- Use the custom formatted date time info in Email/SMS/Slack
- Compare the Current date(Start Date) with the Invoice Due date(End Date) and use the dynamic value in Email/SMS/Slack,
- Eg: Your Invoice is due in {{datetime\_formatter.1.days}} days,
- Note: On overdue, that is when Current Date(Start Date) is greater than the Invoice Due Date(End Date), you will get the result in a negative value
