This webhook is essential for externally billed apps within our marketplace. It must be accessed by developers to authorize the installation of the app.

The primary purpose of this webhook is to capture and update payment information for apps that employ a Paid business model and do not utilize HighLevel's internal billing mechanism.

## 1\. Prerequisites for using this webhook [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/oauth/Billing/index.html\#1-prerequisites-for-using-this-webhook "Direct link to 1. Prerequisites for using this webhook")

Before using this webhook, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/):

1. You should have an app with a Business Model marked as Paid.
2. External Billing must be enabled for your app.
3. You must have entered the Billing URL.

## 2\. Retrieving Parameters from the Billing URL [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/oauth/Billing/index.html\#2-retrieving-parameters-from-the-billing-url "Direct link to 2. Retrieving Parameters from the Billing URL")

When an Agency or Location installs your app, they will be redirected to the Billing URL specified in the configuration. You will receive the following parameters in the URL:

| Parameter Name | Possible Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clientId | `<client_id>` | Used for validation. |
| installType | `location`, `agency` | You will receive `agency,location` in case of both agency and location. |
| locationId | `<location_id>` | You will receive this in case of `location` or `agency,location`. |
| companyId | `<agency_id>` | You will receive this in case of `agency` or `agency,location`. |
