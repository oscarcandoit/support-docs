## Frequently Asked Questions [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/marketplace-modules/Snapshots/index.html\#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")

**Q: Can I list multiple Snapshots in one app?**

Currently, you can only include one Snapshot in an app. Ensure that the Snapshot's assets align with your app’s value proposition.

**Q: What is the difference between white-label and standard listing types?**

- **White-Label:** Removes branding, increasing the app’s appeal across various HighLevel customers.
- **Standard:** Retains visible branding, which may limit its reach.

**Q: What happens if my app submission is rejected?**

If your app is not approved, you’ll receive feedback from the HighLevel team detailing necessary changes. Update your app accordingly and resubmit.

**Q: Can I update my app after it’s been published?**

Currently, you cannot modify your Snapshot link once your app is published. The update app feature is coming soon in Q1'25.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many apps I can create?**

No, there is no limit to the number of apps you can create and sell in the App Marketplace.

**Q: How do buyers use my Snapshot after purchasing it?**

Once purchased, buyers can push the Snapshot directly to their locations through their HighLevel dashboard.

**Q: Can I set different pricing models for different Snapshots?**

Currently, pricing models are configured per app. To offer different pricing for individual Snapshots, you’ll need to create separate apps.
