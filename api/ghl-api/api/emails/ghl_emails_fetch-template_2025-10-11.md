We are thrilled to announce a game-changing feature: the ability to sell Conversation AI & Voice AI templates in the App Marketplace!

## Generate a Marketplace Link [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/marketplace-modules/ConversationsAIandVoiceAI/index.html\#generate-a-marketplace-link "Direct link to Generate a Marketplace Link")

On HighLevel, in the **Conversation AI** or **Voice AI** page, select the agent and click **Sell this Template/Agent on Marketplace**.

> _This option is visible only to Agency Owners and Admins. Sub-account admins and users cannot view this option._

You can also multi-select agents and build a template with a team of agents.

The template will not only include the prompts, but also the actions such as:

- Triggering a workflow
- Creating an appointment


Along with the underlying assets: workflows, calendar, custom field/value, etc.

> You’re selling the whole package.

**Important:** Ensure the assets you're packaging are not imported as part of an IP-protected snapshot. Restricted/IP-protected assets cannot be included in the AI agents.

You’ll be redirected to the **[Developer Portal](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/apps)** with a special link that carries your bot’s package.

If you wish to update your existing template listed on the marketplace:

1. Make the necessary changes in the **Conversation AI** or **Voice AI** page.
2. Click **Copy Link for Marketplace** from the menu.
3. Update the link in the [Developer Portal](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/apps) (see step #2 below).
