## Configure Trigger Data [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/marketplace-modules/CustomTriggers/index.html\#configure-trigger-data "Direct link to Configure Trigger Data")

- Input a sample JSON payload that represents the data structure the trigger will handle. This sample is used to configure filters and custom variables.

## Can Workflows Execute Without Contact? [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/marketplace-modules/CustomTriggers/index.html\#can-workflows-execute-without-contact "Direct link to Can Workflows Execute Without Contact?")

- Workflow can run contactless without any Contact data dependency so you can send any payload data via Marketplace Triggers and use it in workflow.
- You can proceed without contact and use actions that are not dependent on contact information. Custom Webhook, Google Sheet, Slack, ChatGPT and all Internal Tools can be executed without contact.
- If necessary, you can use the Create/Update or Find Contact actions to retrieve the contact data to the workflow.

**Examples:**

- Send order data to trigger and add the order information to google sheet, use if/else to categorize based on order value and send a slack notification.
- Retrieve the contact with Contact ID using Find contact action
