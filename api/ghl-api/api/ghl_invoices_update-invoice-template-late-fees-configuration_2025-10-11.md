## Prerequisites [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

- A **HighLevel Agency** account.
If you do not have a HighLevel agency account, you can create one by signing up on [Marketplace Portal](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/). Once logged in, head to the **Testing** tab to create a sandbox account.

- **Role:** If you're using an existing HighLevel account, you must be an **Agency Owner or Admin** to create Marketplace listings.

- **Developer Portal:** You must be signed in to (marketplace.gohighlevel.com) for listing the agent on the marketplace.

- A clear **use case** (e.g., lead qualification, appointment booking, call routing, support triage).


* * *

## Step 1 — Design your agent [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-1--design-your-agent "Direct link to Step 1 — Design your agent")

- **Define the job-to-be-done.** “Who does this agent help, and how do we measure success?”
- **Map the interaction.** Draft happy path + recovery paths (fallback, transfer to human, re-ask, escalate).
- **List required assets.** Workflows, calendars, custom fields/values, tags, custom fields, etc.
- **Guardrails & tone.** Style, compliance boundaries, PII handling, and off-topic responses.

**Pro tip:** Draft 6–10 **suggested questions** you’ll later add to the Marketplace listing so buyers can try-before-install (for chat agents).

* * *

## Step 2 — Build in HighLevel [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-2--build-in-highlevel "Direct link to Step 2 — Build in HighLevel")

Choose your channel and configure essentials:

### [Creating Conversation AI Agents (chat & messaging)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001335-conversation-ai-bot-explained) [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#creating-conversation-ai-agents-chat--messaging "Direct link to creating-conversation-ai-agents-chat--messaging")

### [Creating Voice AI Agents (phone)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004107-creating-voice-ai-agents) [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#creating-voice-ai-agents-phone "Direct link to creating-voice-ai-agents-phone")

## Step 3 — Test like a buyer [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-3--test-like-a-buyer "Direct link to Step 3 — Test like a buyer")

- **Conversation AI:** Run end‑to‑end chats with your suggested questions. Verify outputs, field mapping, workflow triggers, and error messages.
- **Voice AI:** Place **test calls** from multiple devices; review call history (transcript, audio, summary), tune prompts, and confirm transfers/appointments.
- **Edge cases:** no‑show calendars, invalid emails, multi‑turn clarifications, rate limits.

**Go/No‑Go checklist**

- [ ]  Agent completes the core task unaided 3× in a row
- [ ]  Recovery paths work (re-ask, escalate, or handoff)
- [ ]  Workflows, calendars, and custom fields update correctly
- [ ]  Clear user feedback on failures + safe fallbacks

* * *

## Step 4 — Package as a Template and Sell on Marketplace [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-4--package-as-a-template-and-sell-on-marketplace "Direct link to Step 4 — Package as a Template and Sell on Marketplace")

- Convert your single agent **or** multi‑agent team into a reusable template.
- In **Conversation AI** or **Voice AI**, choose your agent/template and select **Sell this Template/Agent on Marketplace**.
- You’ll be redirected to the **Developer Portal** with a special link representing your package.
- To update an existing listing later, copy the new Marketplace link from the agent and update it in the Developer Portal.
- Ensure the template includes its **underlying assets** (workflows, calendars, custom fields/values, etc.).
- **Do not** include restricted assets from IP‑protected snapshots.

**Cataloging guidance**

- **Title:** Clear outcome + audience. _Example:_ “Dental Lead Qualifier & Scheduler (Chat + Voice)”
- Fill **Use cases**, **Agent description**, **Available actions** (workflows, appointments, transfers, etc.).
- Add **Suggested questions** buyers can try in the Marketplace preview (for chat agents).
- Review non‑editable **channels** (SMS, email, Instagram, calls) and confirm accuracy.

## Step 5 — Complete **App Details** in the Developer Portal [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-5--complete-app-details-in-the-developer-portal "Direct link to step-5--complete-app-details-in-the-developer-portal")

**Listing polish tips**

- Navigate to Profile > App Profile page to catalog your agent effectively.
- Lead with the outcome and who benefits.
- Show videos/screenshots/gifs of the agent in action + first‑run checklist.

## Step 6 — Pricing [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-6--pricing "Direct link to Step 6 — Pricing")

Make sure to keep your agent free to be eligible for the Contest duration. For detailed steps, see the [App Pricing Setup Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001217-set-up-your-app-pricing).

* * *

## Step 7 — Finalize & Submit for review [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/AIAgentsGettingStarted/index.html\#step-7--finalize--submit-for-review "Direct link to Step 7 — Finalize & Submit for review")

- Complete **Basic Info**, **App Profile**, **Pricing**, and **Support** sections.
- Submit for **Marketplace review**. Once approved, your listing goes live.
