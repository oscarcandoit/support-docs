Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/intro/index.html\#getting-started "Direct link to Getting Started")

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new/)**.

### What you'll need [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/intro/index.html\#what-youll-need "Direct link to What you'll need")

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:

  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/intro/index.html\#generate-a-new-site "Direct link to Generate a new site")

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic

```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/intro/index.html\#start-your-site "Direct link to Start your site")

Run the development server:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
cd my-website
npm run start

```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
