We’re excited to announce that the GoHighLevel MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is now **live and ready for use!** , opening up a world where advanced AI assistants can talk directly to your GHL data and tools. Think of it as a bridge: you can now **query, automate, and orchestrate** everything in your GoHighLevel account with AI, in any app that supports HTTP based MCP (like Cursor, Windsurf, OpenAI Playground, and more).

**You can also build your own agent. Plug in your favorite AI. Let automation and insights flow.**

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. GHL-MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools without worrying about internal details of how highlevel apis function.

## Quickstart Guide [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#quickstart-guide "Direct link to Quickstart Guide")

### 1\. **Get Your Private Integration Token (PIT)** [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#1--get-your-private-integration-token-pit "Direct link to 1--get-your-private-integration-token-pit")

- Go to **Settings > Private Integrations** in the GoHighLevel Location you want to use.

- Click **“Create New Integration”**, choose the required scopes (see below), and copy the generated token.


### 2\. **Configure Your Agent/Client** [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#2--configure-your-agentclient "Direct link to 2--configure-your-agentclient")

- Add the MCP endpoint and authentication headers to your agent. The locationId in header is optional - and can be passed as part of prompts as well if needed.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "ghl-mcp": {
            "url": "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer pit-12345",
                "locationId": "110411007T"
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### 3\. **Start Making Requests** [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#3--start-making-requests "Direct link to 3--start-making-requests")

- Use any compatible client or agent to send HTTP requests to the MCP server endpoint.
- You can now access GHL data using natural language and tool calls.

## Integration with n8n [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#integration-with-n8n "Direct link to Integration with n8n")

You can seamlessly integrate the Highlevel MCP server with n8n to automate workflows and connect your GHL data with hundreds of other applications. Here’s how to set it up:

### 1\. Configure the MCP Client in n8n [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#1-configure-the-mcp-client-in-n8n "Direct link to 1. Configure the MCP Client in n8n")

In your n8n workflow, add the MCP client node and set the MCP URL to `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/`. For the transport protocol, select **HTTP Streamable**, which is available in n8n v1.104 and later.

### 2\. Set Up Authentication [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#2-set-up-authentication "Direct link to 2. Set Up Authentication")

- Choose **Header based Auth** and provide the following credentials:

  - **Key**: `Authorization`
  - **Value**: `Bearer pit-token-here`

### 3\. Provide the Location ID [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#3-provide-the-location-id "Direct link to 3. Provide the Location ID")

Our MCP server supports dynamic `locationId` s. You can either hardcode it or provide it dynamically:

- **System Prompt**: For a fixed location, set it in the system prompt of your LLM node:





```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
The location id is <ghl-location-id-here>

```

- **User Prompt**: Alternatively, the tool can request the `locationId` during the conversation, and you can provide it in a chat message.

### 4\. Select Your Tools [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#4-select-your-tools "Direct link to 4. Select Your Tools")

Once configured, you can select any of the available GHL tools as needed for your workflow.

**You can do much more beyond these above examples.**

## Roadmap & Vision [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#roadmap--vision "Direct link to Roadmap & Vision")

- npx package for rapid integration with clients that don’t support HTTP Streamable protocol yet (including Claude Desktop).
- OAuth support.
- Goal to expand to **250+ tools** as part of a unified orchestrator layer. This will lead to MCP being a single connector with all these capabilities without eating up LLM tokens.
- Enable full automation, integration, and orchestration across the GoHighLevel ecosystem.

## Try It Out & Feedback [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/other/mcp/index.html\#try-it-out--feedback "Direct link to Try It Out & Feedback")
