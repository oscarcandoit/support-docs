Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on a user's verified identity and permissions. It determines what a user can do within a system after they have been authenticated (proven their identity). Essentially, it's about verifying that a user has the right to access specific resources or perform certain actions.

### When should I use a Private Integration Token? [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/authorization_doc/index.html\#when-should-i-use-a-private-integration-token "Direct link to When should I use a Private Integration Token?")

You should use a Private Integration Token if:

- Your use case involves accessing our API endpoints for internal purposes.
- If you don't need webhooks or custom design or pages.
- If you need to access only 1 sub-account at a time.

#### Example use cases: [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/authorization_doc/index.html\#example-use-cases "Direct link to Example use cases:")

- Internal data synchronization
- Custom reporting dashboards
- Automated tasks within your own system

### When should I use OAuth 2.0 Flow? [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/authorization_doc/index.html\#when-should-i-use-oauth-20-flow "Direct link to When should I use OAuth 2.0 Flow?")

You should use OAuth 2.0 Flow if:

- You're developing a full-scale integration intended for public use.
- Your integration requires features like webhooks and custom modules.
- You need advanced security features and standardized authorization management.

#### Example use cases: [​](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/authorization_doc/index.html\#example-use-cases-1 "Direct link to Example use cases:")

- Third-party applications
- Creating custom conversation providers/custom workflow actions and triggers, etc.
